    "he proposed extended opening hours would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity, health, quality of life and well-being of neighbouring residential occupiers through increased levels of noise and disturbance. The applicant has not demonstrated any methods to mitigate or minimise the potential adverse noise impacts of the proposed extended opening hours and the adverse impacts of the proposal that have been identified could not be overcome or adequately mitigated through the imposition of planning conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy 7.15 of the London Plan (2016), policies D12 and D13 of the Draft London Plan (2017), policies SP.3 and BN.11 of the Local Plan (2015) and policies SP.3, BN.1 and BN.12 of the Draft Revised Local Plan (2018)."
