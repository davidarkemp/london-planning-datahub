    "The proposal would constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt that would cause substantial harm to the openness. No considerations exist which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and other identified harms so as to amount to very special circumstances. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DM5 and DM10 of the Kingston LDF Core Strategy (2012), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed use and land clearing has eroded the valuable function of the land in both supporting local wildlife as well the well-greened semi-rural character of the area and by creating an urbanising effect, contrary to Policies DM4 and DM10 of the Kingston LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through Biodiversity or Ecological assessments that the proposal including the land clearing has not resulted in unacceptable harm to, or adequately mitigated any adverse impacts to the biodiversity value of the site or on-site habitats. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF 2024, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the Kingston LDF Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The application would be subject to Biodiversity Net Gain (BNG), however, no BNG information has been submitted and nor has it been demonstrated that the proposed development would be exempt from BNG, contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site is located within a critical drainage area and it has not been demonstrated that the use/works described in the application have not adversely impacted the current or future drainage conditions of the site/adjacent sites. The proposal would be contrary to policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2024,."
