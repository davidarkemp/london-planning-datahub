    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of its size, design and siting with insufficient set-back from front elevation would appear as an excessive and overdominant addition to the host building, and  would unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Given the excessive height and mass of the proposed single storey rear extension, it would appear as  overbearing and unneighbourly when viewed from to the adjoining property, No 158 Elmbridge Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
