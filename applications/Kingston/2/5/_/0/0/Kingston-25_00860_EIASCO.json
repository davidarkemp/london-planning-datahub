    "1. Introduction\r\rApplicant/Developer: Berkeley Homes (West London) \rLPA Reference Number: 25/00860/EIASCO\rScoping Request Date: 26.03.2025\rDate of Scoping Opinion: 12.06.2025\r\rPurpose of this Report: This document sets out the Scoping Opinion of the Local Planning Authority in accordance with the Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 (as amended).\r\r2. Description of Proposed Development\rLocation: Motspur Park Gas Holders Site, West Barnes Lane, KT3 6NQ\rProposed Development:\rA residential-led scheme comprising circa 650 homes with public realm, car and cycle parking and associated infrastructure, servicing, access, landscaping and all associated ancillary works and structures.\rSite Context:\r\r\rThe site is located at Motspur Park Gas Holders, to the south of West Barnes Lane in London, KT3 6NQ. The site is located in Metropolitan Open Land (MOL), Flood Zone 3. There are 25 Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINCs) within 2 km of the site. There are eight statutory designated sites for nature conservation value within the 2 km of the site boundary. The central gas holders area and southern site access are located within the RBK Borough wide air quality management area (AQMA) and the northern site access is located within the LBM Borough wide AQMA. There are two grade II listed buildings within 1 km of the site boundary. The site is located in Kingston upon Thames, Tier II Motspur Park Gasholders Archaeological Priority Area (APA).\r\r3. Scoping Process Summary\rConsultation Undertaken:\r\rThe Environment Agency (EA)\rNatural England (NE)\rGreater London Archaeological Advisory Service (GLAAS)\rRBK Borough Environmental Health Officer\rTransport for London (TfL)\rRBK Lead Local Flood Authority \rRBK neighbourhood Traffic Engineer \rThe full consultation responses are attached to this report. \r\r4. Key Environmental Issues to be Addressed in the Environmental Statement\rOfficers have had regard to the accompanying Motspur Park Gas Holders, EIA scoping Opinion Request Report dated March 2025 and agree with the proposed structure and content of the forthcoming ES as briefly summarised below:\rThe ES will address the requirements of Schedule 4 of the EIA Regulations. The proposed structure and content of the ES is as follows:\r\ro Non-Technical Summary;\ro Volume 1: Main Environmental Statement:\r\r1. Introduction;\r2. EIA Process and Methodology;\r3. Alternatives and Design Evolution;\r4. Proposed Development Description;\r5. Demolition and Construction Description;\r6. Archaeology; \r7. Socio-Economics;\r8. Transport; \r9. Air Quality;\r10. Noise and Vibration;\r11. Ecology; \r12. Ground Conditions;\r13. Water Resources;\r14. Solar Glare; \r15. Wind Microclimate;\r16. Climate Change;\r17. Cumulative Effects;\r18. Summary of Additional Mitigation and Residual Effects\r\ro Volume 2: Townscape and Visual Assessment\ro Volume 3: Technical Appendices.\rFollowing review of the emerging proposed development, significant environmental effects are not considered likely in respect of built heritage, daylight, sunlight and overshadowing; telecommunication interference; aviation; waste; major accidents and disasters; and human health. ES Volume 3 will include the following ES technical appendices to inform the planning application:\ro Heritage Statement; \ro Human Health Impact Assessment;\ro Construction Site Waste Management Plan;\ro Operational Waste Management Plan; and\ro Aviation Impact Assessment.\rThe ES shall be expanded to include: \rTraffic and Transport: the 1km cumulative effects zone should be extended to measure 1km from where the site meets the LBS highway network. \rEcology and Biodiversity: Drainage strategy to be scoped as a significant possible receptor of impacts including whether combined sewage outfalls (CSOs) would be considered, the use of 'Downstream Defenders' prior to any discharge of surface waters into the water course, the possibility of new domestic or business mis-connections to the watercourse /surface water sewer network, reducing discharge into the water course as far as possible etc.\rHorse Fields/Hide Hill to be scoped in as a possible sensitive receptor\r\r6. Requirements for the Environmental Statement\r\r- Structure of the ES\r- Non-Technical Summary\r- Methodologies and Standards\r- Mitigation and Monitoring Measures\r- Alternatives Considered\r\r7. Conclusion\rThis Scoping Opinion defines the scope of the Environmental Statement for the proposed housing development. It does not preclude the planning authority from requiring further information during the planning application process if new issues arise.\r"
