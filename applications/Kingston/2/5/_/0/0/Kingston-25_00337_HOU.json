    "The submitted proposed plans show different eaves and total height of the proposed extension. Due to the submission of inaccurate plans, Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the property or the wider area and on the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. Furthermore, the proposal would encroach on the adjoining property No 11 Priory Road and no appropriate ownership certificate has been submitted. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of accurate and consistent drawings/information, that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbouring properties, or the character and appearance of the existing property or the wider area, in conflict with the Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) as well as Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
