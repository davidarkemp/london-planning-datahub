    "By reason of its bulk, design, height and siting the proposed development would be excessive in scale, would sit uncomfortably with the host building and surrounding properties and within the street scene which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of scale and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 7 The Fairway by reason of overbearing appearance and would lead to an unacceptable loss of daylight and as such the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 32 of the Council's Residential Design SPD."
