    "The proposed side extension, due its siting and design, with no set back from the front building line and the proposed roof form, would appear as a disproportionate and  incongruous addition to the host dwelling. As such, the proposal would result in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building  and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012, and Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD."
