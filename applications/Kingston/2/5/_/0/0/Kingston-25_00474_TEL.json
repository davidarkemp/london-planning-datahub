    "In light of an objection from the operator of the high pressure pipeline, no robust evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there would be no adverse impact on the existing high-pressure pipeline apparatus. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed siting would be appropriate and that it would not raise safety concerns. As such the proposal is considered to be contrary to Paragraph 122 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 and Schedule 2 Part 16 of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "No details have been submitted with regards to the proposed removal of the existing mast and the associated equipment at the adjoining Chessington Garden Centre. As such, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not result in a proliferation of such infrastructure that would have a cumulative detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area and the Green Belt, contrary to Paragraphs 120 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policies G2 of the London Plan and CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
