    "Given the excessive depth, scale and siting of the proposed development, it is considered to constitute an unneighbourly addition that would appear as an overbearing when viewed from both adjoining properties. Furthermore, the proposed single storey rear extension would adversely affect the outlook from the nearest principle habitable room at No 98. As such the proposal would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the neighbouring properties, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposal would provide adequate standard of accommodation in terms of room sizes, size of communal areas such as kitchen/dining area and floor to ceiling height contrary to Policy D6 in the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the guidelines and standards under Kingston's Housing in Multiple Occupation Standards 2023",
    "Due to the excessive scale and depth and siting of the proposed single storey rear extension, it would result in a disproportionate and dominant addition that would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021), Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024),  Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r"
