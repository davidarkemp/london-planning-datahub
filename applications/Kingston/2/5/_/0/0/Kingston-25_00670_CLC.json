    "Condition  4  of planning permission 24/01497/HOU  states :\r\r'The development shall be completed in accordance with the following details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing with the Local Planning Authority, prior to above ground works \r\rManufacturer (s) details to show wood effect UPVC window frames, door and bi folding doors ( including their dimensions, colour and texture)\r\rReason : In order that the architectural and historic interest of the Old Malden Conservation Area (A) is safeguarded  in accordance with Policy CS8 (Character, Heritage and Design) and Policy DM12 ( development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets) of the LDF Core Strategy  Adopted 2012'.\r\rOfficers note the applicant is seeking to part discharge the planning condition and has submitted details relating to bi folding doors only. In this instance, the wording of the condition  as set out above does not allow the applicant to part discharge the planning condition.\r\rAlbeit the fact the applicant may have decided not to install the full 'package' of windows, door and bi folding doors as  shown on the approved drawings, the scope of the planning condition does require  that manufacturer details of all these elements in the form of a single complete submission  need to be formally submitted to the Local Planning Authority for review and  for approval prior to above ground works.   On this basis, the applicant can then choose which  windows/ door/ bifolding doors they wish to implement  on a timescale best suited to them  and within the lifetime of the permission. \r\rThe submitted details in relation to Condition 4  (window details)  of planning permission ref 24/01497/HOU are considered to be insufficient  to fully discharge the planning condition  and is therefore contrary to Policy DM10   (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions)  and DM12 (Development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r"
