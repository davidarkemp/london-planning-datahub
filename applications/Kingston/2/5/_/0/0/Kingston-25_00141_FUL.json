    "It has not been demonstrated that the provision of the external staircase would not adversely affect the existing kitchen windows and therefore the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at the flats below at 326 Hook Rise North in terms of unacceptable loss of outlook, privacy, daylight and undue overlooking. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed staircase would not adversely affect the amenities of potential  future occupiers of 322-324 Hook Rise North in terms of undue overlooking, loss of privacy and disturbance. Therefore, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in a poor standard of residential accommodation, as evidenced by the failure  to demonstrate adequate access to the proposed unit and usability of the proposed waste and recycling storage. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that integrated, well-designed, accessible and convenient recycling facilities and cycle storage could be provided for the proposed unit and could be accommodated with the suggested location, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
