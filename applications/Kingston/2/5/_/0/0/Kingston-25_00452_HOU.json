    "The proposed development would by virtue of its excessive scale create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually dominant and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. Given lack of information regarding the proposed materials and due to submission of inaccurate drawings, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would be of satisfactory appearance and in-keeping with the existing street scene. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 40 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
