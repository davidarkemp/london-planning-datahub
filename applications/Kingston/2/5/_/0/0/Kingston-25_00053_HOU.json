    "It is considered that the proposed outbuilding,  due to its size, siting, scale and height, would appear as a disproportionate  and incongruous addition and as such would adversely affect the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Accordingly the proposal is in conflict with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Given the proposed size, siting, scale and height of the outbuilding and the lack of any arboricultural information Officers are not able to fully assess the impact of the proposal on the amenities of the adjoining occupiers in terms of an overbearing appearance. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been  provided to demonstrate that  the proposed  development would not adversely affect the health and well being of  trees in neighbouring gardens. Given lack of any arboricultural information Officers are not able to fully assess the impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area.  As such, the proposal is in conflict with Paragraph 136 of the NPPF 2024, Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
