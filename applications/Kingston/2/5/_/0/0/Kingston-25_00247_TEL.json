    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and reduce the openness of the verge and detract from the character and appearance of the Manor Park Local Open Space. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed telecoms development would be in close proximity to a number of street trees and the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact on these street trees. \r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
