Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "By reason of design and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of the surrounding neighbouring properties by reason of a loss of privacy and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2024)."
