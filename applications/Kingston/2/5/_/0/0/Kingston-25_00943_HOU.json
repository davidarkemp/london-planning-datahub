    "By reason of its bulk, mass and design, it is considered that the use of metal cladding to clad the cheeks of the proposed rear dormers would exacerbate the scale of the proposed roof extensions including the proposed hip to gable roof extension resulting in highly prominent features on the rear roofslope of the host dwelling when viewed from the rear gardens of neighbouring properties of Beechcroft Avenue and Cardinal Crescent.  In this context, it is considered that the proposed dormers as currently proposed would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the host dwelling as well as within the immediate surrounding area   and is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of London Plan 2012, Policy CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) , Residential Design SPD (2013)"
