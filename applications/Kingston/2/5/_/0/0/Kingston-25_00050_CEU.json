Accordingly, a Certificate of Existing Use, Operation or Activity could not be issued under Section 191 of The Town and Country Planning Act (1990)",

As such, the proposal would amount to a material change of use of the land amounting to development requiring planning permission and the use does not benefit from permission via a Development Order i.e. does not amount to permitted development.\r\rEnabling works which potentially comprise engineering, waste disposal and/or other building operations appear to have been carried out. Accordingly, it has not been demonstrated that the totality of the works are lawful. As such, the proposal would comprise engineering works amounting to development requiring planning permission and the works do not benefit from permission via a Development Order i.e. does not amount to permitted development."
