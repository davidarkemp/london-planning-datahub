    "By reason of depth and height, the proposed rear extension would not pass the 45-degree test in relation to the closest habitable windows at 40 Hollybrush Road, and as such officers consider that the proposed development would unduly compromise the amenities of  40 Hollybrush Road, by reason of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
