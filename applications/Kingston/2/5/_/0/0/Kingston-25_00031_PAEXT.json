    "While the submitted drawings show that the render would be of a similar form and size to those of the existing dwelling, it has not been demonstrated that they would be of a similar colour and finish. The applicant is expected to explicitly demonstrate and/or state that the materials would be similar to those of the existing dwelling. In the absence of such confirmation, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would comply with Condition A.3 (a) (materials used in any exterior work shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the  Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and would not pass the BRE 45 degree test with regards to daylight as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD in relation to neighbouring property at no 2 Oakleigh Avenue. In addition, due to the siting, depth and height of the proposed extension along the shared boundary with neighbouring no2 Oakleigh Avenue, it is considered that the proposed extension would constitute an unneighbourly form of development presenting an overbearing appearance  in close proximity to a primary habitable room window at no 2 Oakleigh Avenue  giving rise to an unreasonable loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure."
