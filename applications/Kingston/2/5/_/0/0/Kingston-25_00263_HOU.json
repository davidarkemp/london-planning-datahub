    "The proposed roof extension, due to its design and excessive mass and bulk is considered to appear as a disproportionate and bulky addition to the host dwelling, that would unbalance the adjoining semi-detached property and would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
