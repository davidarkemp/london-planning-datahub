The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
