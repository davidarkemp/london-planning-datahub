    "The proposed development is of a poor design and would be discordant and highly prominent when viewed from neighbouring properties and the streetscene and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwellings and wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2024).",
    "The proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of both neighbouring properties as it would be overbearing and un-neighbourly, resulting in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the principle windows of the nearest ground floor habitable rooms, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
