    "Insufficient information, in terms of a lack of a robust TfL compliant traffic model, has been submitted to adequately demonstrate the proposal would not result in unacceptable impacts on the transport network, such as increased queuing or that the mitigation proposed would be appropriate. Furthermore, no legal mechanism has been submitted to secure the necessary financial contributions for junction improvements by the highway authority. The proposal would be contrary to Paragraph 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policies  T1, T2, T4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies DM9 of the RBK LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed quantum of car parking spaces would exceed the maximum parking standards as set out in the London Plan. The proposal would not adequately manage vehicle use and would fail to identify and pursue opportunities to promote walking, cycling and public transport use, as such would not comply with Policies DM9 of the RBK LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2024.",
    "Insufficient information, in terms of a robust and rigorous Travel Plan inclusive of consistent baseline data and measures to achieve a meaningful mode shift and details on mode share targets, has been submitted to demonstrate how dependency on private vehicles would be reduced and sustainable and active transport would be prioritised, contrary to Paragraph 118 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policies T1 and T2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM8 of the RBK LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The submitted Energy Strategy does not comply with the London Plan hierarchy strategy. The application is not supported by a Whole Life-Cycle Carbon (WLC) emissions report to fully capture the development's carbon footprint. Furthermore, absent a Circular Economy statement with no legal mechanism to secure a cash in lieu contribution for the on site Co2 shortfall, the proposal would not comply with policies SI 2, SI 3 and SI 4, S7 and SI 12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "It has not been adequately demonstrated that an Urban Greening Factor (UGF)  target score of 0.3 could not be achieved on site. The proposal would be contrary to Policy G5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal would not meet greenfield run-off rates. Sustainable drainage measures further up the drainage hierarchy (e.g. rainwater harvesting, and rainwater infiltration through further reduction of hardstanding and increase of soft landscaping) have not been adequately explored and discounted. The proposal would not comply with Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 Core Strategy 2012.",
    "A fire safety strategy has not been submitted and therefore it has not been demonstrated from the outset that the development would meet the highest standards of fire safety. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D12 (B) of the  London Plan 2021."
