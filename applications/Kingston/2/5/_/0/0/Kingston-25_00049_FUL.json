    "The proposed addition of a phasing condition to a development comprising six residential units is considered to be unnecessary and unjustified, given the limited scale and uncomplicated nature of the scheme. Furthermore, the introduction of phasing would add undue complexity to the implementation of the permission without delivering any planning benefits, and could potentially unnecessarily delay housing delivery and the completion of the housing development. As such, the condition fails to meet the tests of necessity, relevance  and reasonableness set out in paragraph 57 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) and the associated Planning Practice Guidance."
