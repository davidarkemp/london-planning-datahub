    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed siting of waste and recycling storage facilities, and the access arrangement, would be of an adequate standard and in compliance with the borough's waste management strategy, contrary to  policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed cycle storage due to its siting would not be conveniently  located and  accessible, and therefore not  fit for purpose. Furthermore, it would result in loss of the amenity space. As such the proposal would be contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed soft landscaping plan is insufficient, and inadequate. The proposal fails to provide adequate low-level planting, including shrubs, and no trees. The proposed hedging to the defensible space to the front is not considered to be appropriate. As such, it is considered that the proposal would not ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal will ensure the safety of all building users, contrary to Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021."
