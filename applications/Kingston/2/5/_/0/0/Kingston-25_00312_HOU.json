    "It is considered that the proposal to discharge surface water as existing to the foul sewer is not in compliance with the sustainable drainage hierarchy and there is no evidence that other means of draining the site to comply with the drainage hierarchy have been explored. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would achieve, as close as reasonably, greenfield runoff rates. Therefore, the proposal is contrary to Policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted (2012)."
