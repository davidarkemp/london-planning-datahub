    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The finished floor levels of the development to which this permission relates shall be no lower than those of the existing building(s) and any electrical sockets or other electrical fittings within the development shall be installed no lower than 750mm above finished floor level.\r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any above-ground works, a detailed landscape & planting plan shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe plan shall include, where appropriate, a clear key or legend corresponding to the landscaping plan and providing the following information:\r\r- Replanting of lost trees on a ratio of 2 trees planted for each tree lost\r- Species (both Latin & Common names) for all plants\r- Locations of all plants or areas of planting\r- Plant numbers or planting densities\r- Sizes of all plants and particularly trees 'at time of planting'\r- Details of all hard-landscaping areas including materials \r\rThe approved scheme shall then be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced at the beginning of the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development hereby approved shall not be implemented other than in accordance with the recommendations contained within the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal dated 28.04.2024, Preliminary Roost Assessment dated 20.03.2024 and Bat Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys (BERS) dated 05.06.2024. \r\rAny artificial lighting must be inline with the recent bat conservation trust Guidance Note GN08/23.\r\rPrecautionary checks for nesting birds must be undertaken by contractors prior to commencement of works. Any active nests will need to be retained, undisturbed.\r\rIn order to provide bat roost potential a bat box or an integrated bat brick must be incorporated into the proposed development as recommended in the hereby approved Bat Emergence and Re-Entry Surveys (BERS) dated 05.06.2024.\r\rThe approved scheme shall be implemented in full prior to beneficial occupation of the development (or commencement of any work on site where relevant to the construction phase).\r\rReason: To safeguard the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site, in accordance with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed replacement windows shall be installed at the same window recess depth as the windows in the original house.\r\rReason:  To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates, excluding the balcony as indicated on the drawing ref  24.11/PA.04 Proposed Plan, shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any new windows or rooflights above the ground floor level in the both, side elevtions shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the Arboricultural Impact Assessment DPA 7173-AIA-REV 2 April 2025.  The approved measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "No building hereby permitted shall be occupied until evidence (photographs and installation contracts) is submitted to demonstrate that the sustainable drainage scheme for the site has been completed in accordance with the drainage strategy. The sustainable drainage scheme shall be managed and maintained thereafter in accordance with the agreed management and maintenance plan for all of the proposed drainage components.\r\rReason: To comply with the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems, the National Planning Policy Framework (Paragraph 182), the London Plan (Policies SI 12 and SI 13) along with associated guidance to these policies.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the drainage system as shown in the Drainage and SUDS Strategy 4024-ZB-110LHR-DMP shall be implemented in full and permanently maintained thereafter.\r\rReason: To prevent the development from increasing the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere, in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Statement and Fire Strategy Plans 2411/PA05 hereby approved and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of Fire Safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "Prior to commencement of the development a Construction Ecological Management Plan (CEMP) must be produced for the site setting out the safeguards and appropriate working practices that will be employed to minimise adverse effects on biodiversity and ensure compliance with UK Wildlife Legislation. The details of the CEcMP shall be informed by the final site design and ongoing ecological survey works but should include as a minimum:\r\r- Development standoffs and safeguards for all retained habitats,\r- Construction timetables to avoid sensitive periods such as nesting bird season, Covering open excavations and pipework to avoid the accidental entrapment of terrestrial mammals,\r- A method statement to ensure the proposed development does not result in the spread of invasive plant species such as butterfly-bush; and,\r- Retaining deadwood or moving it under the supervision of a suitably qualified ecologist.\r- The development shall be implemented and maintained in accordance with the agreed CEMP.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase, and to safeguard the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site, in accordance with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
