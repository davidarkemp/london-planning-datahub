Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed  rear extension on the character and appearance of the property or the wider area and on the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of accurate and consistent drawings, that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbouring properties, or the character and appearance of the existing property or the wider area, in conflict with the Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) as well as Policy CS8 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",

The proposed development would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 38 of the Council's Residential Design  Supplementary Planning Document 2013.\r"
