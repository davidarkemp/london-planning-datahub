    "In the absence of any cogent assessment of the impact of the proposed development on the solar panel at adjoining No. 133 being submitted, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not result in a significant reduction in solar performance to the affected solar panel. It therefore has not been demonstrated that the development would achieve high sustainability standards and would not hamper low carbon energy generation contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2024)."
