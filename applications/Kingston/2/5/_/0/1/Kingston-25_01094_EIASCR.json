    "An EIA is not required for the proposed development. \r\rOfficers concur with the Screening Opinion submitted by the applicant. \r\rThe Site area does not exceed the threshold criteria for an 'urban development project' as classified in Schedule 2, and is not within an environmentally sensitive area, as defined by the EIA Regulations (e.g. a SSSI). The Site is not considered to be sensitive to new development and environmental impacts are unlikely to be complex or widespread. This has included consideration of cumulative impacts. \r\rStandard mitigation measures can be used to effectively reduce all other impacts identified. The Proposed Development has been considered on its merits both individually and in combination with other development commitments which have the potential for cumulative effects. From this a site-specific understanding of the environmental constraints has been undertaken, and based \rupon evidence, it can be concluded that the Proposed Development does not constitute EIA Development."
