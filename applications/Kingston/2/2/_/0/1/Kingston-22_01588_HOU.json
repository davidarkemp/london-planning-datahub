    "Due to the design, siting, bulk and mass of the proposed development,  the proposal would appear a dominant addition to the host property and would not relate well to the prevailing pattern of development within the surrounding area. Furthermore, the proposal would detract from the established character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Given that the applicant has not sufficiently and robustly demonstrated that the proposal would not cause adverse harm to the existing protected trees on site, the proposed development is contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
