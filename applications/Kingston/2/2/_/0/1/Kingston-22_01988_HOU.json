    "By reason of its excessive height, roof form and blank front elevation, the proposed single storey side extension would not be in keeping with the character of the existing dwelling and appear as an incongruous addition within the streetscene. The proposed development would therefore have an unacceptable impact in terms of character and appearance, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its excessive depth, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary, the proposed ground floor side/rear extension, would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to the adjoining property, No. 86 Durlston Road, thereby conflicting with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
