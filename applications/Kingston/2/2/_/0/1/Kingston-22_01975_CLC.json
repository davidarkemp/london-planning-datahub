The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe information submitted does not meaningfully engage with the requirements of the planning condition. For example the following statement does not address the point of the condition \"not relevant - family members will agree this as common sense.\"\r\rFire Safety is clearly an important issue and a detailed, but proportionate response is required. \r\rI note the submission references Town and Country Planning Development Management Procedure Order 11(3)(c) - this relates to the submission of Planning Applications, not applications made under a planning condition.\r\rThe applicant is requested to resubmit with a detailed response to the points set out in Condition 5 of Planning Permission 22/00968/HOU. \r\r"
