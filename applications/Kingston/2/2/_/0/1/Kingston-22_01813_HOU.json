    "The proposed raising of the roof height and alteration to the roof design would appear  as an inappropriate and dominant addition to the host property, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area and would result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy Paragraph HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
