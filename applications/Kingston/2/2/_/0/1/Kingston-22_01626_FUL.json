    "Given the proposed car-free nature of development and the lack of supporting information in the form of a parking beat survey, the application fails to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, on-street car parking provision in surrounding streets and traffic congestion to the surrounding highway network, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation based on the inadequate floor to ceiling heights. As such, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Due to the design, materiality, roof form and unusual form of the proposed development, the proposal would appear awkward and bulky, and would not relate well to the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
