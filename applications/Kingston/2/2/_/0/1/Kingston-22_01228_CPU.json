    "The proposed change of use of the application site from a taxi business (Sui Generis Use) to a martial arts training centre (Use Class E) would fall within the definition of development under Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, being a material change of use. The proposed use would not be permitted under the provisions of Section 55(2)(f) of the 1990 Act and therefore the change of use requires planning permission. Planning permission has not been granted by the Local Planning Authority or by The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 or any other statutory instrument. \r"
