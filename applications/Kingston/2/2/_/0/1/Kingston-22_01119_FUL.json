    "By reason of its siting, height, design and illuminance the proposed communication hub with internally lit advertisement LCD sign would be an incongruous addition within the streetscene, creating visual street clutter that would detract from the character and appearance of the area and harm the setting of the Conservation Area. The proposal would be contrary policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and guidance found in the NPPF 2021",
    "The proposed development would result in obstruction to the footway and as such would present an increased pedestrian safety risk, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012.",
