    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed additional storey would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the rear amenity space and closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 1 Voewood Close in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, overshadowing and overbearing impact. Due to the siting, orientation, and scale of the proposal, officers consider that there is a likelihood that the development would appear overbearing and would reduce light entering into the neighbouring windows at ground floor level and would result in material overshadowing of the rear amenity space, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
