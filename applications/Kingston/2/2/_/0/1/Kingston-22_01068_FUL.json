    "The proposed development, a hot food take-away, would be within 400 metres of Tiffin Boys School. As such the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) of the London Plan (2021) which states that development proposals containing A5 hot food takeaway uses should not be permitted where these are within 400 metres walking distance from the entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the siting of the external plant would not give rise to adverse impacts on the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers by way of noise, odours and smells and as such the proposal would not be in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed external plant by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and be visually intrusive in the street scene creating visual clutter. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
