In the absence of which the application has failed to  demonstrate the finished floor levels, flood resistance and resilience measures, access and escape.  The proposal is contrary to Paragraph 167 of the National Planning Policy Framework, and policies  DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy K24 of the K+20 Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan.",
    "The proposal due to its design and layout, provides a poor quality of accommodation  for future residents due to the substandard size of private external amenity space and lack of communal amenity space. As such the proposal fails to comply with  D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13  Housing Quality and Mix of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012, and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Residential Design SPD.",

    "The development has failed to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types to meet the identified housing needs of the Borough. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the delivery of 30% of the residential units within the building (including the recently consented 4 additional units at first and second floor) as  3 bedroom units (family sized units) would be unsuitable or unviable. As such, the development is contrary to Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",

The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DM9 (Managing Vehicle Use for New Development) of the LDF Core Strategy, April 2012, Policy 6.13 (Parking) of the London Plan 2016  and guidance contained within the LDF Sustainable Transport SPD (Adopted May 2013) and the Council's Planning Obligations SPD (2017).",
