    "By reason of its siting, height, design and excessive illuminance level, the proposed communication hub with internally lit advertisement LCD sign would lead to an incongruous addition to Ewell Road, creating visual street clutter that would detract from the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in obstruction to the footway and increased pedestrian safety risk, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the Hub incorporates sufficient measures to mitigate crime and antisocial behaviour, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated the Hub has been suitably designed to minimise energy consumption in the provision of its services, in accordance with the energy hierarchy, contrary to the NPPF (2021) and Policy SI2 of the London Plan (2021)."
