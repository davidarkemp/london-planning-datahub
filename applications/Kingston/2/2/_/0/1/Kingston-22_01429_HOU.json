    "The finished floor levels of the development to which this permission relates shall be no lower than those of the existing building(s) and any electrical sockets or other electrical fittings within the development shall be installed no lower than 750mm above finished floor level.\r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to any above ground works (excluding demolition) a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.

The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. The landscaping scheme shall include details of screening between the boundary of the site and Ellerton Road.\r\rAny trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced during the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as ''19 Ellerton Road, Tolworth, Surbiton, as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r"
