    "The proposed development is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation due to the ground floor bedroom only being served by a single side facing window orientated towards, and in close proximity to, the neighbour boundary with 23 Hardman Road giving poor levels of outlook to future occupiers of the property and as the amended layout will result in the kitchen / living space receiving very poor outlook and access to natural daylight. As such, the proposed development is in conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 and DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design SPD (2013)."
