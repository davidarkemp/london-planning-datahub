    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the 89 Beech Croft Avenue Fire Safety Report prepared by Resi dated February 2022 unless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure that the development incorporates the necessary fire safety measures in accordance with the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as ''89 Beechcroft Avenue, New Malden, KT3 3EE\", as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 26.04.2022, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
