    "The details submitted are insufficient to support the discharge of Condition 3 (Construction Logistics Plan) of Planning Permission 19/01464/FUL. \r\rThe submitted CMSLP provides insufficient details with regard to how materials will be brought\rinto and removed from the site, and what measures will be put into place to safeguard pedestrians\rand other road users. Mention is made of the use of traffic marshals but the applicant should\rprovide a site management plan showing how this will operate in practice.\r\rThe applicant is reminded that no construction-related vehicles (including those belonging to\rprivate contractors) are permitted to park on any residential road in the vicinity of the site, other\rthan in a pay-and display bay in accordance with any time restrictions. Wherever possible,\rcontractors should travel by public transport, walking or cycling.\r\rThe applicant is advised that it is their responsibility to ensure that all relevant highways permits\r(e.g. scaffolding, hoarding, oversailing, tower crane), skip licenses, temporary traffic management\rorders and parking permits as may be required are put in place at the appropriate times.\r\rIf the means of construction vehicle access entails vehicles crossing the public footway (including\ruse of an existing vehicle crossover) the applicant must contact the Highways Crossover Officer to\rdetermine whether a strengthened crossover is required.\r\rNo materials must be stored on the public highway unless this has been expressly permitted by\rRBK Highways.\r\r[INFORMATIVE] The applicant is advised to also contact the Highways Inspections Team to\rarrange for a highway condition survey to be undertaken before commencing these works.\rRBK Highways may from time to time advise the applicant that changes should be made to the\rrouting of construction traffic and the applicant must abide by any such requests, even where\rthese represent a departure from what has been previously stated in the CMP/CLP.\r\rPending the applicant providing greater detail on loading/unloading routes into and through the\rsite and pedestrian management arrangements, Highways would not support Condition 3 being\rdischarged.\r\r"
