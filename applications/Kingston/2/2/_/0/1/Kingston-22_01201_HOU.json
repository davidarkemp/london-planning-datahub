    "The proposed roof panels would be readily visible from the public realm and little information has been submitted that would demonstrate that the proposed solar panels would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the Conservation Area. Whilst some information has been submitted there is no confirmation that an appropriate solar panel would be used i.e. an integrated, not over-the-roof, panel. Given the sensitivity of the location it was considered inappropriate to seek to secure this level of detail via planning condition. Whilst the principle of increasing renewable sources of energy is supported, in this instance, owing to the absence of detailed information, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021,  Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021)."
