    "By reason of the siting of the proposed building in close proximity to the neighbouring public house, and the introduction of habitable rooms windows directly facing the neighbouring site, and the absence of appropriate mitigation demonstrating that the amenities of future occupiers of the development can be adequately safeguarded without the need for future restrictions on the operations of the neighbouring public house, in relation to noise and odour, the application is considered to be in conflict with the 'agent of change' principles set out in paragraph 187 of the NPPF (2021) and D13 of the London Plan.",
    "The extension would extend beyond a part of the building which would not form part of the principal part of the building, as defined in the GPDO. Therefore, the building does not benefit from the rights afforded by Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA (d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
