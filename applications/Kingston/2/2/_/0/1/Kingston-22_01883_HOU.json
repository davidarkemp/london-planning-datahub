    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to any above ground works (excluding demolition) a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.

The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental, or both, to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '16 Highfield Road, Tolworth, Surbiton, KT5 9LP', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 07.06.2022, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: The outbuilding would not be appropriate as a separate unit of accommodation and, were such a use to occur, this could adversely impact the character and appearance of the area and neighbouring amenity, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
