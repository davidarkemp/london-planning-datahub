    "The proposal would fail to provide an adequate quality or quantum of internal accommodation. The 3bed 5 Person unit is below the required space standard and would not benefit from the required built in storage, and given the siting and orientation of the units, the 3bed 5 Person would result in poor outlook and access to sunlight/daylight for the kitchen/dining/living room area. The 2bed 3 Person unit would not benefit from the required floor to ceiling height, and given the size and orientation of the windows, would result in poor outlook and access to sunlight/daylight for all habitable rooms. Given the orientation of the the 1bed 2Person unit, it could not be dual aspect and given the siting in relation to the front parking, all habitable rooms would result in poor outlook. The proposal would also fail to provide adequate private and usable amenity space, given the siting in relation to the car parking, lack of details regarding boundary treatment, and the contrived and cramped layout. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Given the uncharacteristic subdivision of the rear amenity space, and addition of three amenity spaces on the boundary with 35 Howard Road, officers consider that the proposal would result in a cramped and contrived appearance which would detract from the apperance of the surrounding area, and appear out of character with the prevailing pattern of development within the surrounding area. This would be in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
