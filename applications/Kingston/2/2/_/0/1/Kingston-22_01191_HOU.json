    "The proposed two-storey side extension would result in an incongruous and contrived roof form. This aspects of the proposed development would not relate well to the exsiting dwelling and not only destroy its original character, but would be at odds with the character and appearance of neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor rear extension and two storey side extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at No. 55 and No. 59 Nortcote Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of Fire Safety information that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
