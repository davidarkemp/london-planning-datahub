    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, scale, mass, form, layout and design, would appear as an unduly visually dominant and incongruous form of development, and together with the excessive hardstanding/ lack of landscaping which is out of keeping with the spacious and verdant character of the area, would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and designated Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill strategic area of special character, a non-designated heritage asset. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraphs 130 and 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the height and scale of the proposed frontage replacement dwellinghouse and its proximity to the boundaries of Laburnum and Grey Gables, and the siting and height of the proposed rear dwellinghouse to neighbouring garden area to No. 7 The Moat, and sense of visual dominance, over-enclosing effect and loss of outlook to Stanhope House to the south of the application site given its proposed two-storey scale and siting would result in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of these neighbouring properties by way of sense of visual dominance, overbearing and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficiently robust assessment within the submitted Daylight and Sunlight assessment which fails to assess the impact of the proposed two-storey dwellinghouse to the rear of the application site upon the daylight and sunlight levels of Stanhope House to the south of the site. As such, it has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable loss of light to the accommodation and overshadowing effect on the amenity space of Stanhope House. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of a Fire Safety Statement and/or Plan, nor any other details (for example a swept path analysis) has been submitted to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable fire safety, contrary to Policy D12a of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The submitted basement impact assessment is not sufficiently robust in its content for officers to properly assess the impact of the proposed basement upon groundwater conditions, land stability or flood risk, contrary to Paragraphs 170 and 178 of the NPPF 2021, Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the LDF Core strategy 2012."
