    "The excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension, and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No.49 Egmont Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No.49 Egmont Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and therefore, taking all factors into consideration reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
