    "The proposed roof alterations and rooflights, by reason of their siting, scale, treatment and excessive quantity, would appear as an incongruous addition to the existing dwelling, and would appear visually dominant in the streetscene, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm to its significance for which there would be no public benefit which would outweigh the identified harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The proposed roof alterations by reason of the siting, scale and quantity would have an unacceptable impact on the outlook and would cause noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties at No.s 11 and 15 St Albans Road. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
