    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at No. 34 Hardman Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
