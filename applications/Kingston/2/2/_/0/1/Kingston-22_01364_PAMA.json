Noise levels in bedrooms should also not normally exceed 45 dB LAmax,F more than 10 times during the night time. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To protect residential amenity in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r"
