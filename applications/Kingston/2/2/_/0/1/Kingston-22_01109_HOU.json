    "By reason of scale and mass, the proposed two storey rear extension, would appear excessive in scale, and dominant in relation to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated through a Basement Impact Assessment conducted by a qualified professional, that the construction of the basement would not cause significant disturbance and disruption with particular regard to impacts on: local ground conditions; flood risk and drainage; land and structural stability; protection of biodiversity; archaeology and heritage assets; neighbour amenity; air and light pollution; and the impacts of noise, vibration, dust and site waste. As such, officers consider that there is a likelihood that the development would cause disturbance and disruption, in conflict with policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant is advised that any resubmission should be supported by a Basement Impact Assessment"
