  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its siting, size and design (not being set back from the front elevation) and type and colour of the proposed materials would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the immediate surrounding area. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area and would result in harm to the significance of the Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy Paragraph HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not lead to the loss of a car parking space and contribute to traffic congestion/inconsiderate parking in the surrounding area and have an unacceptable impact upon highway safety, thereby conflicting with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and T.6 of the London Plan 2021."
