    "By reason of its overly bulky design and roof form, the proposed dormer and first floor rear extension would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the surrounding Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The excessive scale and height of the proposed first floor rear and single storey rear extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight to habitable rooms at No. 38 Borough Road and would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook and an undue sense of enclosure, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
