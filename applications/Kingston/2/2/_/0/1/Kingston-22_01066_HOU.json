    "The proposed roof alterations would dominate the original dwellinghouse, which in turn would lose much of its original character. Furthermore, the developed dwellinghouse would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene and would represent a cramped form of development which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property, thereby conflicting with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document 2013.",
    "By reason of its flat roof design, the proposed first floor rear extension would not relate well to the original dwellinghouse, resulting in a roofscape which would be incongruous and uncharacteristic of the area, thereby conflicting with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document 2013. \r"
