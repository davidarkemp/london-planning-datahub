    "Due to the excessive depth of the extension, the proposed development would constitute an incongruous addition that would not relate well to the host property or the immediate surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Given the excessive depth and height of the proposed extension, combined with its siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 46 Vale Crescent. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor principal habitable room at No. 46 Vale Crescent. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012)."
