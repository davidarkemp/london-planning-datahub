    "The proposal would fail to provide an adequate quality of internal accommodation. The proposal would not provide adequate outlook for all bedrooms at ground and first floor level, or adequate levels of privacy for the bedrooms at first floor level. The proposal would also not provide adequate ceiling to floor heights. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Given the proximity of the proposed two storey dwelling in relation to neighbouring property 1 Douglas Road, officers consider that the proposal with windows at first floor level facing to the rear elevations, would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy and undue sense of enclosure for the occupants of these neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to refuse/recycling storage. As such, it has not been robustly demonstrated that the proposed development would not result in a nuisance in regards to the collection of refuse/recycling storage, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The development would result in the loss of commercial / employment floorspace and premises. The applicant has not submitted any sound evidence or rigorous marketing over a number of years to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses . As such, there would be an unjustified loss of employment land / premises contrary to Policy DM 17 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012, and therefore the development would prejudice a sufficient supply of land and premises in to meet current and future demands for industrial and related functions contrary to Policy E4 of the London Plan 2021.\r"
