    "Due to its bulk and mass the proposed single storey annex would be dominant and disproportionate in size to the main dwelling and would result in an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed annex by reason of its siting, size and use is not considered to be for ancillary use to the host building and is capable of being used as a separate dwelling. The proposal is therefore contrary to  policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM11 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. and Kingston Residential Design SPD (2013) Policy 41."
