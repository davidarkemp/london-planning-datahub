    "The removal of condition 4 of planning permission 22/00562/FUL would conflict with the purposes of its imposition which is to protect the appearance and character of the semi-detached dwellings and surrounding area, and the LPA is not satisfied with the details provided that its removal would not detract from the character and appearance of the host properties or surrounding area, and as such the proposal would not be in accordance with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r\rThe applicant is reminded that if they wish to construct standalone extensions, they would be able to submit a standalone planning application. The impact of the standalone application would be assessed on its own merits."
