    "Prior to any above ground works (excluding demolition) a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021."
