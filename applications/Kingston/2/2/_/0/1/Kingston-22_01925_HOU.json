    "The proposed garden structures by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property detracting from the character and appearance of the plot and creating visual clutter and intrusion in the private views of the site from rear of the neighbouring properties. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The deposited plans do not clearly show the finished floor levels and there would appear to be conflict between the plans and deposited site photographs. As such officers are unable to determine with any certainy in particular whether the proposed development would have an impact on neighbouring amenity through overlooking from any potential elevated finished floor levels above ground floor. As such the proposed development would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
