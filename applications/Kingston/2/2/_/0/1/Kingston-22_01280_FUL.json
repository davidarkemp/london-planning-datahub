    "The proposal, by virtue of its plot subdivision, bulky roof form and lack of set in from the shared boundaries at first and roof level, would present an overly dominant addition to the host property and an uncharacteristically over-dense pocket in the area which would erode the characteristic gaps between dwellings on Douglas Road. In these regards, the proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Given that the on-site car parking could not be delivered such that each car parking space could be accessed independently, the applicant  has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, inconsiderate parking, and increased on-street car parking pressure which could harm pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to cycle and refuse/recycling storage. As such, it has not been robustly demonstrated that the proposed development would provide adequate means of cycle and refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013."
