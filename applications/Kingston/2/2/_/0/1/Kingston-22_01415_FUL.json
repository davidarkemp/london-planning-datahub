    "The proposed development would not meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers conclude that the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The proposals would result in the loss of 3-bedroom accommodation suitable for family occupation, at a time when the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 identifies a significant need for such accommodation in the Borough. The proposals are therefore found to be contrary to RBK Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 and Policy DM13 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012."
