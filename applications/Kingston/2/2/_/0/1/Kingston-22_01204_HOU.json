    "The proposed single storey side extension due to its lack of set back from the front elevation would result in a loss of symmetry to the adjoining semi-detached property. This proposed side extension would not relate well to the exsiting dwelling, would be overly prominent within the street scene, and would be at odds with the character and appearance of neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012"
