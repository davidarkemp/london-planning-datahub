    "The proposed two-storey side extension with associated changes to roof height and roof form would be excessive, incongruous and overly dominant failing to create a subordinate addition. These aspects of the proposed development would not relate well to the existing dwelling and would not only erode its original character, but would be at odds with the character and appearance of neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "As a result of the proposed loss of the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling, the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development could adequately accommodate 1 off-street car parking space and would not result in an unacceptable impact upon traffic congestion, inconsiderate parking in the surrounding area and highway safety, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
