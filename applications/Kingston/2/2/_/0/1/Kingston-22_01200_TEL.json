    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its inappropriate siting and appearance would erode the openness of the public realm and would result in an incongruous addition to the street scene that would be visually intrusive and would not be in keeping with, but detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
