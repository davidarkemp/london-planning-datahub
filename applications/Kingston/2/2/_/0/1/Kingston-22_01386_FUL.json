    "The proposed change of use of the land to a storage and distribution (Class B8) use, and the associated operations and paraphernalia associated with that use, would be completely out of character with the suburban residential character of the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The application site has poor accessibility by public transport and would likely increase of the use of the car as a mode of transport and would therefore fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent evidence and complete information, that the proposed development would not adversely impact on-street car parking capacity which could harm the amenities of neighbouring properties and adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Paragraphs 108 and 109 of the NPPF (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
