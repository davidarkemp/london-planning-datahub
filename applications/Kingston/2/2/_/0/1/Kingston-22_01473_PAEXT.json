    "The proposed single storey rear extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii), of Class A, part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and would fail the 45 degree test with regards to daylight as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD in relation to No 129 Barnfield Avenue.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of depth and siting, the proposed erection of a single storey rear extension would unduly impact the amenities of No 129 Barnfield Avenue by reason of overbearing appearance and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
