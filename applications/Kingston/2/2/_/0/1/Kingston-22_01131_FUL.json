    "The proposed Multi-Functional Communication Hub must be managed in accordance with the submitted Management Plan and must include the ongoing use of an algorithm to identify repeated anti-social number use, with a review after the first three months of installation between police and the operator to assess any issues arising. Any change to the management plan must be approved in writing by the local planning authority and the Metropolitan Police Designing Out Crime Team.\r\rReason: To mitigate crime for all users, and in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), as well as Policies DM10 and CS14 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial use of the Multi-Functional Communication Hub hereby approved a Management Plan detailing the provision, management and maintenance of the Defibrillator shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall only be used / operated in accordance with the approved Management Plan. \r\rReason: The provision of a Defibrillator is a significant public benefit and the condition would ensure that it is provided, in accordance with Policies SD6(6) and Policy D8(K) of the London Plan (2021).\r",
    "No development shall take place, including the removal of the 5 sheffield type cycle stands, until evidence has been submitted demonstrating that 5 replacement sheffield type cycle stands have been installed elsewhere within Tolworth District Centre. The required evidence shall include approval from the Highways Authority, photographs and technical drawings.\r\rReason: The proposed development would require the removal of 5 sheffield cycle stands with no replacement stands possible within the application site boundary. Replacement cycle stands must be provided in order to encourage sustainable modes of transport, in accordance with Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r"
