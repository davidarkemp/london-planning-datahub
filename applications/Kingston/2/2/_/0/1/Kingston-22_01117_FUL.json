    "The proposed Hub would have an overly dominant appearance within the street scene and would detract from the walking environment along Fife Road and would appear as visual clutter when viewed in isolation and more so when taken with other similar street furniture in the immediate area. The proposal would harm the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies: CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)",
    "The proposed Hub would be an obstruction on the pavement which would result in nuisance and inconvenience to pedestrians at times of busy usage of the footway, contrary to Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
