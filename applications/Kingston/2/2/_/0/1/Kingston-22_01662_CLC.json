They must provide details/illustrations of the exact type of cycle parking at each location, the numbers of spaces and whether it is for short or long term use. At this time Condition 6 should not be discharged. [Note: applicant has attached a ToolStation order of some sort (see 'Product Details' but this provides no useful information and it is unclear as to what purpose it is intended to serve].",
    "Condition 5 (Travel Plan) - The submitted document is lacking in detail, particularly in respect of targets. Although travel surveys should be utilised to inform future target setting, initial specific targets and expected times to achieve these should be included, based on relevant data held by the applicant or by considering similar uses elsewhere. If the applicant does not have access to such data they may need to hire a transport consultant to do this. At this time Condition 5 should not be discharged."
