    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location as it would both constitute inappropriate development in the Metropolitan Open Land and would also create an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views of the site and streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the area. In the absence of very special circumstances being demonstrated that would individually or cumulatively outweigh the substantial weight to be given to the harm to the Metropolitan Open Land and the other harm identified the development proposed would not accord with paragraphs 143 - 147 of the National Planning Policy Framework and policies G3 of the London Plan and CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
