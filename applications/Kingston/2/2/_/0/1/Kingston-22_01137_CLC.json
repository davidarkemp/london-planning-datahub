The applicant has not justifiably discounted green infrastructure such as green roofs, planters or rain gardens. It should be confirmed whether water butts will be incorporated. Therefore, the proposal fails to demonstrate that it would prevent the development from increasing the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere, thereby conflicting with Policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted (2012).\r"
