    "By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling, within the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.11  Romney Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No.11  Romney Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
