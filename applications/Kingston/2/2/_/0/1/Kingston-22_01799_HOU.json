    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor rear extension would pass the 45-degree 'rule of thumb' in relation to the closest first floor habitable room window at No. 61 Clayton Road and as such would not result in an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. \r\rGiven the size of the proposed extension and the proximity of the neighbouring window, Officers conclude in the absence of evidence to the contrary that there would be an unacceptable impact. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
