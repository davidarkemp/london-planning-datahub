    "The proposed hip-to-gable addition, would appear prominently on the existing dwelling as well as the immediate streetscene. The proposed hip-to-gable addition, together with the proposed rear dormer roof addition, would by virtue of its excessive size, height, siting and design create a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and would further unbalance the appearance of the pair of semi-detached dwellings at no.96 and no.94 Deacon Road. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
