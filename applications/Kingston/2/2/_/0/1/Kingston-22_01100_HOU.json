    "Due to its scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design the proposed development would be an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or cause material overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 34 Van Dyck Avenue. The proposed site plan demonstrates that the proposal could result in a detrimental impact to the amenities of the neighbour. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
