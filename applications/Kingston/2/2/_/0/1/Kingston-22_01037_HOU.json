    "The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and would be an incongruos addition to the host property. The proposed development would particularly at first floor and roof level be a dominant and overbearing feature disrupting the symmetry of the roofscape of the terrace and would be visually intrusive in the views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed development therefore would not be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 20`12."
