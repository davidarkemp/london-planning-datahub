    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to any above ground works (excluding demolition) a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.

    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental, or both, to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '144 Kings Road, Kingston Upon Thames, KT2 5HU', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 06.05.2022, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: The outbuilding would not be appropriate as a separate unit of accommodation and, were such a use to occur, this could adversely impact the character and appearance of the area and neighbouring amenity, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
