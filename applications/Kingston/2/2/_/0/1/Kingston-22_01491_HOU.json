    "The proposed first floor rear/side extension aspects of the proposed development would not relate well to the existing dwelling and would not only erode its original character, but would be at odds with the character and appearance of neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their excessive scale and siting hard up to the site boundary, would appear overbearing when viewed from 19 Cranborne Avenue and result in an undue sense of enclosure and a loss of daylight, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
