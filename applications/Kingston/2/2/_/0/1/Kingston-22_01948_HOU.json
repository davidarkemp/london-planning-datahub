    "The proposed development would by virtue of its size, siting and design create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area, resulting in an unacceptable visual impact on the street scene. The proposal would not accord with Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The scale and proximity of the proposed extension to neighbouring habitable room windows at No 77 Glebe Gardens is such that there would likely be an unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to this property. No cogent information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in a significant loss of daylight/sunlight to No 77 Glebe Gardens, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its siting and excessive bulk, scale and mass would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining properties, by reason of overbearing appearance and creation of an undue sense of enclosure. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
