    "The applicant has not demonstrated through a Basement Impact Assessment conducted by a qualified professional, that the construction of the basement would not cause significant impact on local ground conditions, neighbour amenity, air and light pollution and the impacts of noise, vibration, dust and site waste nor what impact the proposed basement would have in a surface water flood risk area nor how the basement itself would be impacted. As such, officers consider that there is a likelihood that the development would cause disturbance and disruption, in conflict with policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant is advised that any resubmission should be supported by a Basement Impact Assessment"
