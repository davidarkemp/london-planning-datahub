    "The proposed advertisement installed to the Hub would have an overly dominant appearance within the street scene and would detract from the walking environment along Victoria Road and would appear as visual street clutter that would detract from the character and appearance of the area, especially when the cumulative impact of nearby advertisements are taken into account. As such, the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the special character of the Surbiton Town Conservation Area contrary to Policy HC1 of the London Plan and Policies: CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed advertisement to be installed on the Hub would be sited on a narrow and heavily used footway such that it could interfere with the safe passage of pedestrians by causing pedestrians to step into the road, harming public safety which would be contrary to Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
