    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would create a dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties, unbalancing the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and detract from the host property and the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The propsal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD July 2013."
