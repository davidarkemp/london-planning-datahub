    "By reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No. 21 Lancaster Gardens, the proposed first floor side and gable extension are considered to be of a poor design and would not only result in an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling, but would also erode the characteristic gaps between properties on Lancaster Gardens, which could lead to a terracing effect. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
