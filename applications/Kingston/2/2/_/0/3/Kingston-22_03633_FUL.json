    "Due to the loss of the pipes and air conditioning units at roof level serving both the cold storage and ground floor shop and no replacement indicated, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed residential units at the first floor level would not adversely affect and restrict the future operation of this commercial premise. This would not accord with Paragraph 182 of the NPPF and Policy D13 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Given the lack of outlook and privacy for both bedrooms within the proposed development, and the reduction of amenity space for the existing flats as well as the inadequate provision of private amenity space for the proposed flats, the proposal would provide a substandard level of accommodation. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with the NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of height, close siting and introduction of a shared amenity space, the proposed development would unduly compromise the amenities of the flats at first floor level within 78-80 Tolworth Broadway Road, by reason of loss of privacy, loss of light/sunlight and feeling of overbearing.Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
