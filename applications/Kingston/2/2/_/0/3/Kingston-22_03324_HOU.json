    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development (including any works of demolition), a detailed arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.  This submission shall include:\r\rA plan to a scale and level of accuracy appropriate to the proposal, that shows the positions, crown spreads and root protection areas (RPA) of every retained tree on site, and on nearby ground or land adjacent to the site, in relation to the approved plans.\rA schedule of pre-construction works for the above-detailed trees, where appropriate.\rCalculated dimensions and positions of all tree root protection areas.\rDetails and positions of tree protection barriers and ground protection where appropriate.\rDetails and positions of any construction exclusion zones.\rDetails and positions of the existing and proposed underground service runs, to be routed to avoid root protection areas where possible and if not possible, for alternative methods of installation to be detailed within the AMS.\rDetails and positions of any change in levels or positions of any excavations within 5m of the root protection area of retained trees.\rDetails of any special engineering required to accommodate proposals within the root protection areas of retained trees (e.g. in connection with foundations, service installation, bridging, water features, surfacing).\rDetails of the working methods to be employed for the installation of drives, paths or any other form of hard surfacing within the root protection areas of retained trees in accordance with the principles of 'No Dig' construction. All details shall be in accordance with British Standard BS5837: 2012 \"Trees in relation to Design, Demolition and Construction\"\r\rThe approved protection scheme shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site including demolition, and be maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development or until such stage as detailed within the approved AMS.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the South Elevation of the development hereby approved unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, Fire Safety information (a Strategy) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.

The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\r\r"
