    "The high wall and gates would remove any passive surveillance in and out of the application site. Furthermore, the domineering impact of the proposal would create an inhospitable environment generating the perception of or increasing the fear of crime. The proposal would not follow 'Secured by Design' recommendations and would not comply with the aims and objectives of Policy D11 of the London Pan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "By reason of it's height and siting, the proposed 2m wall and gate would significantly reduce visibility for drivers exiting the application site, to the detriment of other highway users such as pedestrians, cyclists and users of the bus stop. It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not impinge highway safety and as such, the proposal is contrary to Policy T2 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM8 & DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposed front means of enclosure would by reason of its height, materials, and siting appear domineering,  inhospitable, and oppressive. The proposal would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, and the NPPF 2021."
