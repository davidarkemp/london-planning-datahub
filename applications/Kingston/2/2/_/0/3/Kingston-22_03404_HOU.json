    "Due to the siting of the development, the proposal would not adhere to the prevailing pattern of development within the area, and as such would appear a prominent addition to the host property and incongruous within the surrounding area, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to Southborough Conservation Area, that would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
