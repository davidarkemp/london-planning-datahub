    "The proposal provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents due to the lack of windows, resulting in inadequate light and outlook to habitable rooms located ground floor level, and the lack of  private external amenity space. Additionally, no details have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed accommodation would have  appropriate floor to ceiling heights.  As such the proposal fails to comply with  Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021  and Policies DM10 and DM13  of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 13 and 16 of the RBK Residential Design SPD",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension, by reason of its design, mass and form would represent a discordant feature that fails to respect the character of the original building and  would detract from the appearance of the host building and this part of Brighton Road. As such, the proposal would fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021),  Policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 35 of the RBK Residential Design SPD.\r",
    "The proposed two bedroom residential dwelling is located adjacent to noise generating commercial uses. No detailed Noise Assessment has been submitted and no  mitigation measures have been proposed to address  this issue of noise and disturbance to future residents. In the absence of such detail, it is considered that the proposed residential accommodation could be subject to potential noise disturbance  to the detriment of future occupiers which could impact on the viability of the adjacent commercial uses. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies D13 and D14 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and paragraphs 130 and 187 of the National Planning  Policy Framework (2021).",
    "No Fire Strategy has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development can achieve adequate levels of fire safety. The proposal therefore fails to comply with  Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The  proposal fails to make provision within the  site for secure and covered  cycle parking provision. The location of the proposed cycle hoops on the external flank wall of the development  would result in highway safety concerns  arising from potential conflict with cars parking and manoeuvring in this location. The  proposal  therefore  fails to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and  Policies DM8 and  DM10  of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the RBK Sustainable Transport Supplementary Planning Document (May 2013)."
