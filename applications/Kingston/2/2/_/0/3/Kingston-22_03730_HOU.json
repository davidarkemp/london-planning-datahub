    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as 247 Malden Road,  New Malden, KT3 6AG as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed  22 November 2022, unless otherwise first agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason : the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with Policy DM10 (Design requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy; \r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. \r\rThe Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan 2021."
