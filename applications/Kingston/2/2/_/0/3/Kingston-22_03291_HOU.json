    "The proposed outbuilding by virtue of its size, siting and appearance would be an incongruous addition to the host property and streetscene that would be a dominant and overbearing visually intrusive feature and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and cause less than substantial harm to the surrounding designated heritage asset Riverside South Conservation Area it sits within and the setting of the adjacent non-designated heritage asset the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character. The proposal therefore would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Lisated Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 189 to 203 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
