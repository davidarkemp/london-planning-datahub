    "By reason of the scale, particularly its depth, of the proposed first floor extension to the rear of No.32 Kingsdowne Road, the proposed development would adversely impact upon the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.30 Kingsdowne Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to this adjoining property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
