    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would be an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would detract from the character and appearance of and cause less than substantial harm to the the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character (a non designated heritage asset) and would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide sufficient off street parking and would not exacerbate existing on street parking demand. In the absence of a signed and completed legal agreement for a car free development to mitigate demand for on street parking, the proposal has the potential to create congestion and parking pressure that could prejudice highway safety and the proposal would therefore not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF and policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed units would not all meet the internal finished floor to ceiling heights with the units on the 2nd and 3rd floors only having a height of 2.4metres which is below the required 2.5m set by London Plan Policy D6 and as such the accommodation would be of a substandard nature and not comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed rear balconies on the upper floors by virtue of their size, siting and design would lead to actual or perceived overlooking of the neighbouring occupiers in particular the gardens of 18 Acacia Grove and as such result in a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers which would cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring ocupiers and diminsih their existing living conditions.",
    "In the absence of any supporting detailed evidence that the Lime Tree T.6 can be retained and in the absence of any Arboricultural Method Statement, Tree Protection Plan and Landscape and planting scheme it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact on trees which could in turn have a detrimental impact on the amenities of the surrounding area and therefore would be contrary to Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
