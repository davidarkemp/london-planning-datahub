    "The proposed roof extension by virtue of its size, siting and poor quality design would not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property creating an incongruous addition which is exacerbated by the external finishes which are visually intrusive in the private views of the site from neighbouring properties and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012"
