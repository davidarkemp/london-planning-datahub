    "The proposed accommodation would be of a substandard nature and would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards for a three storey 3-bed dwelling set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The external amenity space would be undersized against the criteria set out for new dwellinghouses in the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013. Based on the information submitted, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development would lead to a material intensification of the access and this is likely to prejudice highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development in terms of its siting, representing a cramped layout and poor design, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would be provided with inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers in terms of its siting, representing a cramped layout and poor design, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
