    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No. 88 Durlston Road and would not result in an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
