    "The proposed front extension would result in insufficient room to accommodate off street car parking at the application site and place undue pressure on the already limited off-street parking availability, contrary to Policy Guidance 38 of guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013), Policy DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021. \r"
