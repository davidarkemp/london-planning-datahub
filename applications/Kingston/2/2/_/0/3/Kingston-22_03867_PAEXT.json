    "Due to the excessive depth and height of the proposed extension along the shared boundaries with adjoining Nos. 5 & 9 Fernhill Gardens, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable overbearing impact and undue sense of inclosure, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012."
