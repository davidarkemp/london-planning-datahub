    "The applicant has provided insufficient information to properly assess the application and officers cannot be adequately satisfied that the proposed development would not cause significant harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in terms of noise and odours from the proposed extraction equipment. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposals involve the removal of a public bench to the front of the shop unit along Castle Street, resulting in a loss of social infrastructure to the public realm as a seating / resting place, which would have a detrimental impact upon the overall streetscene, contrary to the GLA's Healthy Streets Approach, Policies SD6 and D8 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM11 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the NPPF 2021."
