    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses, such as lower cost and affordable workspace. The net loss of employment capacity within Surbiton District Centre (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies E1 and SD9 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No mechanism has been submitted to secure the proposed development as 'car free'. The proposal fails to encourage sustainable modes of travel and that the development would not increase congestion and on-street car parking stress which could adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed refuse and recycling storage, specifically in terms of its siting, is considered to be inadequate to properly serve the development and could result in the inconsiderate disposal or storage of waste and recycling materials in the vicinity of neighbours, or on the street which would harm the character of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development is provided with impractical cycle storage, in terms of its siting, to serve the new development, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted as part of the application to demonstrate that the proposed residential unit would benefit from minimum 2.5m floor to ceiling heights. As such, the proposed development is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021."
