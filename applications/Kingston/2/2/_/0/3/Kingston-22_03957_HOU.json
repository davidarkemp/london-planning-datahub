    "The proposed extensions and alterations by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from the host property and would cause less than substantial harm to the Thames side Strategic Area of Special Character a non designated heritage asset and the riverside north conservation area a designated heritage asset failing to either preserve or enhance the conservation areas character and appearance and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm. The Proposal would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed buidings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 193 to 202 of the  NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 .",
    "The composition of the plans is unclear as to whether there would be a full height glazed central section facing the river and there are concerns here that such a feature would result in light spill and potential light pollution that may cuase harm to the amenities of the surrounding area and as such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adpopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
