    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed two storey side extension and rear dormer roof extension would unbalance the host dwelling and its adjoining, semi detached property and would constitute a disproportionate addition. Due to its visibility from Verona Drive it would also result in an unacceptable visual impact on the existing street scene. The proposed development would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area conflicting with policies Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
