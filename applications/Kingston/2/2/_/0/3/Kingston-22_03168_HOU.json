    "By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling and would not be set-in from the shared site boundary by a minimum of 1 metre in conflict with Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would fail to retain characteristic gaps between houses and would be out of keeping with the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.11  Romney Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No.11  Romney Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
