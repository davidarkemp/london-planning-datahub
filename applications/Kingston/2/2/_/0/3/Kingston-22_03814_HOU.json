    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed rear dormer roof extension would constitute a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and would unbalance the adjoining semi-detached property. It would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
