    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and consistent evidence or robust justification that the site is not suitable or that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the existing office use or a range of alternative employment uses. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS11 and DM 17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "No robust evidence has been provided to demonstrate that adequate floor to ceiling heights are being achieved and, given the lack of private and / or communal amenity space and the siting of single aspect habitable room windows in relation to nearby buildings and communal spaces which will give rise to inadequate levels of outlook and privacy for future occupiers, the proposed HMO use is not considered to represent a satisfactory standard of accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, and DM13 of the Core Strategy and the Council's HMO guidance.",
    "In the absence of a detailed daylight and sunlight assessment it has not been demonstrated that the HMO units/habitable rooms will receive adequate levels of daylight and sunlight in line with BRE guidelines and so is considered to provide a poor standard of accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "No mechanism has been secured to preclude residents from applying for on-street car parking permits in the Controlled Parking Zone, therefore it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not lead to inconsiderate parking and traffic congestion in surrounding roads and thereby have an unacceptable impact upon highway or pedestrian or highway safety, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that sufficient and adequate cycle parking could be provided on site to accommodate the development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013."
