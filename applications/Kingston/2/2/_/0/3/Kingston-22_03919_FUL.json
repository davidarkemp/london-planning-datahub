    "The proposal would not provide an adequate quantum of internal floorspace or privacy for all habitable rooms, would not be considered a wholly dual aspect dwelling, or meet the required floor to ceiling heights, and as such it is considered that the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF 2021.",
    "Given that backland development is uncharacteristic of the form of the area and the proposal would divide the existing garden land, and add additional parking to the rear of the site, the proposal would appear visually out of keeping with the characteristic form of development within the immediate vicinity, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The two proposed on-site parking spaces have not been safely designed and could not be safely accessed, and as such officers are not satisfied that the proposal would not unduly increase parking stress and demand within the surrounding area, and adversely impact on pedestrian and highway safety. . Further given that inadequate details have been provided for pedestrian movement along the access road, the quality of the access road, and the use of the road for the sports and cricket ground, it is considered that the proposal would have adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Given the substantial separation distance of the proposed development from Somerset Avenue, and that the applicant has not provided sufficient details of waste collection, Officers are unable to assess the acceptability of waste arrangements to serve the proposed dwelling which could result in the proposal impeding upon pedestrian and highway safety and appearing a visual nuisance on collection day. This would be contrary to the NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The applicant has not provided a fire safety strategy and the existing access road would not allow sufficient space for an emergency vehicle to safely enter the site, and as such the proposal would not adhere to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that proposal would comply with flood policies in terms of providing an adequate escape route and adequate floor heights to avoid the risk of flooding to the proposed unit nor whether the proposal would add to the risk of flooding elsewhere contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012."
