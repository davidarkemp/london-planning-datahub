The proposal has therefore failed to  demonstrate suitable  long term management of the newly created habitat features and does not demonstrate that the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site will be safeguarded, and is therefore contrary to policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
