    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location as it would both constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would also create an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views of the site and detract from the character and appearance of the area. In the absence of very special circumstances being demonstrated that would individually, or cumulatively outweigh the substantial weight given to the harm to the Green Belt and the other harm identified, the development proposed would not accord with paragraphs 147 - 151 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policies CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
