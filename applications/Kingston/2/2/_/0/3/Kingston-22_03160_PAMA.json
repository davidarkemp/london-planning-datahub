The application site fails to comply with the vacancy requirements, with the premises understood to be in operation under Use Class D1 at the time of assessment.

The proposal would be contrary to, in particular, the aims and objectives of Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) owing to its failure to provide satisfactory natural daylight/sunlight to the proposed habitable accommodation. There is no supporting technical evidence submitted as part of this application to otherwise demonstrate that the proposed accommodation would achieve adequate natural light ingress.\r",
