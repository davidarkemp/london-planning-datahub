    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension, together with the hip-to-gable extensions, would by virtue of their scale, mass and design create a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021."
