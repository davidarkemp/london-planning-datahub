    "The proposed two storey side extension and reduction in size of the existing balcony would be incongruous and erode the coherent appearance and form shared between Nos. 168 - 146 Grand Avenue, thereby eroding the positive contribution that these properties make to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 & HC1 of the London Plan 2021, paragraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 & DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
