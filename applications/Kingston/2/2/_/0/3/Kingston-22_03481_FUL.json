    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",

    "By virtue of its siting and scale, the proposed development, specifically the rear building, would have a materially detrimental effect on neighbouring amenity of those occupiers to the flats at Kavanagh Court as well as future occupiers of the proposed front block (proposed under this planning application) in terms of overlooking and loss of privacy. As such, the proposal is considered to fail to comply with Policy Guidance 16 of the Residential Design Guide SPD 2013, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021.\r",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021. The side accessway is inadequate to serve its function as primary means of access to the residents/visitors of the proposed rear block and allow for unimpeded through access for those with cycles, those who are disabled or allow for people to pass unrestricted, contrary to Policy D4, D5 and T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\r",
    "By virtue of the proposed siting and scale of the proposed buildings, the proposal would result in considerable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The development read as a whole would fail to respect the setting of the locally listed building, adjacent. This would be contrary to Paragraph 130 and Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy Guidance 24 of the Residential Design Guide SPD, 2013.",
    "The encroachment over school safety keep clear road markings and the removal of the bollards to facilitate vehicular access results in unacceptable material harm to highway safety. The proposed development is found to be contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012",
    "Insufficient supporting technical highways information has been submitted to allow Officers to properly assess on-street car parking demand, or traffic and parking impacts resulting from the proposed development. As such, insufficient level of detail has been submitted, and the proposed development is found to be contrary to Paragraphs 111 and 112 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012.",
