    "By reason of height, siting, and depth, the proposed development would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwellinghouse and would appear incongruous from the wider area and streetscene of Kingston Vale Conservation Area. Consequently, it is considered that the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Vale Conservation Area and there are no public benefits associated with the proposed development, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of height, siting and depth in proximity to the site boundary the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of Nos. 10-12 Beverley Cottages by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of outlook and as such the proposed development is contrary to the NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
