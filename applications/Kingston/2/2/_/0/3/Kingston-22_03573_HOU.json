    "By reason of scale and siting the proposed first floor side extension would not be set in adequately from the shared boundaries, and therefore would visually fill the site, which would lead to the erosion of the characteristic gaps between the properties resulting in a terracing effect within the immediate area. Therefore, this would conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
