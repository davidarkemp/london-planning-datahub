    "By reason of scale, mass and design, the proposed first floor side extension with hip-to-gable roof extension would appear overly dominant, would result in the loss of the characteristic cat slide roof diminishing the visual separation between the application dwelling and No. 35 to the south which would result in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene which would erode the character of the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
