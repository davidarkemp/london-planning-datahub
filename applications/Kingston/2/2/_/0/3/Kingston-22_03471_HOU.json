    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would unduly enclose No. 3 Queens Road, would have an overbearing appearance and would unacceptably limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
