    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The Photovoltaic Solar Panels to which this permission relates shall be removed and the roof shall be restored to its former condition on or before 12 January 2028.\r\rReason: The development would be unacceptable on a permanent basis given the potential advancement in technologies with particular regard to increased affordability and availability of solar panels that can be integrated into the fabric of a building.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or and order revoking or re-enacting that order), no solar panels (other than those approved as part of this development) shall be placed on the roof of the building without the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: The site is located within a Conservation Area, the addition of any further Solar Panels may cause harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.",
    "The Photovoltaic Solar Panels hereby approved shall be installed so that they do not protrude more than 0.1 metres beyond the plane of the roof slope when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the roof slope.\r\rReason: To minimise the impact of the development on the host property and the wider character and appearance of the Conservation Area within which the property is located. \r\r\r\r",
    "The development shall only be carried out using the Hyundai Solar Panels 410w hereby approved. The Panels shall be coloured to match the shade of the existing roof slates. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
