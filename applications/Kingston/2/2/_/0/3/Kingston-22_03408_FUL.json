Furthermore, the proposed accommodation presents as predominantly single-aspect with poor quality of outlook and it has not been demonstrated through the submission of any cogent evidence that the proposed accommodation would achieve adequate levels of daylight/sunlight. The proposed private amenity spaces would be of poor quality. As such, the proposal fails to provide a good standard of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10 and DM13 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policy Guidance 13 of the RBK Residential Design Guide SPD, 2013.\r",
