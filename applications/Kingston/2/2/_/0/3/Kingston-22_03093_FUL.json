    "In the absence of a sequential assessment demonstrating that there are no reasonably available sites appropriate for the proposed development in areas with a lower risk of flooding, sufficient detail confirming that floor levels have been set at the required level in line with EA Standing Advice or details of safe access and escape routes as part of an emergency plan to demonstrate that the flood risk to the site has been adequately addressed and managed to ensure that future users of the development would not be placed in danger from flood hazards throughout the lifetime of the development, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 162-167 of the NPPF, Policies D11 and SI2 of the London Plan (2021) and DM4 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its lack of articulation on the side elevation and siting of refuse, recycling and cycle storage causing visual clutter on the Alfred Road frontage is considered to represent a poor quality and incongruous form of development that fails to respond positively to the surrounding townscape, and the character and appearance of the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character, in conflict with Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal, by reason of the poor levels of outlook from the rear facing ground floor bedrooms, upper floor rear facing windows due to the necessary obscure glazing to these windows and inadequate level of private amenity space, is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013). \r",
    "In the absence of a robust daylight and sunlight assessment of the proposed units based on the most recent industry guidelines, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed units would achieve adequate levels of daylight and sunlight, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its design, scale, height and proximity to neighbour boundaries, will result in an undue impact on outlook to the first floor flank window to 35 Balmoral Road, an undue loss of daylight below BRE target levels to this same window and an undue loss of sunlight to two further habitable windows to 3 Glenthorne Road. The proposal is therefore considered to result in an undue impact on neighbour amenity, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development results in the loss of the existing garages and an informal parking area and the level of off street parking falls short of the London Plan maximum parking standards. In the absence of a mechanism being secured to preclude residents from applying for on-street car parking permits in the Controlled Parking Zone, and in the absence of any robust or cogent evidence demonstrating that the proposal would avoid an unacceptable impact on highway safety and the surrounding highway network, the proposal is contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
