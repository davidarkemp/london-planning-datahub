    "The proposed rear extensions by reason of its excessive scale and siting hard up to the site boundary, would appear overbearing when viewed from No. 26a Eversley Road and result in an undue sense of enclosure and potential significant loss of daylight, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
