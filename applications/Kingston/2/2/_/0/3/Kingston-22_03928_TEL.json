    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter that would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, detracting from the setting of the adjacent designated Alexandra Recreation Ground Metropolitan Open Land and causing less than substantial harm to the setting of the adjacent designated heritage asset the Fishponds Park Conservation Area by failing to preserve or enhance its character and appearance with the benefits of the proposal not outweighing the disbenefits of the proposal (less than substantial harm to the conservation area). The proposal would not accord with paragraphs 194 - 208 of the NPPF 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021."
