  "description": "Redevelopment of the site to create 492 new dwellings. Redevelopment and refurbishment of the Tolworth Tower complex comprising the change of use of the existing 3rd to 22nd floors in Tolworth Tower from office (Use Class E) to residential (Use Class C3), change of use of the existing 2nd floor from office (Use Class E) to ancillary amenity space (Use Class C3), change of use of part of the existing 1st floor car park to create a flexible workspace unit (Dual Use Class C3/E) and provision of 3 no. freestanding retail kiosks (Use Class E), with associated external façade alterations and internal refurbishment works. Demolition of the existing retail units fronting Tolworth Broadway and the construction of two new buildings comprising residential units (Use Class C3), ground and first floor commercial space (Use Class E) and public plaza. Reconfiguration of the existing multi-storey car park, vehicle parking and servicing, along with the provision of associated cycle parking, refuse storage, amenity floorspace, landscaping and public realm works (existing M&S, Travelodge and RBK Council Car Park are retained and excluded from the proposals).",

  "decision_conditions": [
    "The application would represent poor design, due to the design of the northern parts of buildings T2 and T3 which would have a significantly detrimental impact on the street scene and views from the north of the site along Tolworth Broadway. It would not incorporate principles of good design contrary to Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including house\rextensions)) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and doesn't pay sufficient attention to how this will appear in views nor proposing tall buildings that are of exemplary architectural quality and materials contrary to Policy D9 (Tall Buildings) of the London Plan (2021) and is not considered to create beautiful buildings as part of well-designed places contrary to the aims of paragraph 126 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The application has failed to demonstrate that the public realm is well- designed and attractive and incorporates green infrastructure that ensures that landscaping is an integral part of the overall design at the base of the proposed towers. The proposed planters, predominance of hardscaping, lack of detail/ specification of trees submitted in relation to the proposed\rlandscaping and tree planting and what impact attenuation tanks below the plaza would have on potential proposals would be contrary to Policy T1 (Tolworth Key Area of Change) and DM 10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions)) of Kingston Core Strategy and Policy D8 (Public realm) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to submit a robust Fire Statement/ Strategy which addresses the requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021) regarding means of escape and access for fire service personnel to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority, the Greater London Authority and the Health and Safety Executive. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, including simultaneous fire evacuation/ fire fighting stairs, contrary to Policy DM22 (Design for Safety) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed significant loss of employment floorspace has not been robustly justified. On this basis the proposal would result in substantial material harm to the vitality and viability of Tolworth District Centre. The applicant has failed to demonstrate by sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a\rrange of employment uses contrary to Policy DM17 (Protecting Existing Employment Land and Premises) nor that the application complies with Policy E1 of the London Plan which includes seeking that existing viable office floorspace capacity should be retained.",
    "The applicant has failed to robustly demonstrate that the proposal maximises affordable housing on-site, nor has a Section 106 agreement secured any proposed affordable housing or Early Stage/ Late Stage Viability Review mechanisms, including if this were to follow a build to rent model, contrary to Policies H4 (Delivering affordable housing) and H5 (Threshold approach to applications) of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS10 (Housing Deliver) and DM15 (Affordable Housing) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Mayor's Affordable Housing and Viability SPG (2017) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to robustly demonstrate through the viability tested route that a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3 or more bedroom units could not be incorporated and no robust arguments or evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that a policy compliant provision of 3 or more bedroom units would be unsuitable or unviable. The proposed development would fail to\rcontribute towards meeting the objectively assessed need within the Borough for 3 bedroom units. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM13 (Housing Quality and Mix) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that on-site carbon reduction has been maximised through the application of the energy hierarchy. The submitted energy statement does not meet requirements by not presenting correct carbon reduction calculations, not maximising renewable energy such as photovoltaic provision, not providing details of proposed air source heat pumps, and not including details of the design of district heating network connection or future potential connection to a network. Nor has it been\rdemonstrated that the cooling hierarchy has been followed to manage heat risk nor how whole life-cycle carbon and circular economy policies have been met. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policies SI 2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions), SI 3 (Energy Infrastructure), SI 4 (Managing Heat Risk) and SI 7 (Reducing waste and supporting the circular\reconomy) of the London Plan (2021) and the Greater London Authority's Energy Assessment Guidance (June 2022).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not increase on-street car parking stress or compromise highway safety, as no Planning Obligation has secured the financial contribution towards the funding of a potential future Controlled Parking Zone (or to preclude residents from applying for car parking permits within any such designated zone), Car Club membership for residents or a car park management plan contrary to Policies DM9 (Managing Vehicle Use for New Development), DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions)) and IMP3 (Securing Infrastructure) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and paragraph 110 and 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No Planning Obligation has secured the on-site residents gym, required financial contribution to site specific primary healthcare requirements or carbon offset payments (subject to minimising this by improving on-site sustainability/ energy standards) that would arise from the proposed development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies IMP 3 (Securing Infrastructure) and CS13 (Improving Community Health and Well-Being) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Planning Obligations SPD (2017) and Policy S2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would meet London Cycling Design Standards including in relation to the access route between the lift and cycle stores and lack of provision of showers or lockers for users of commercial space. The proposed development would thereby be contrary to Policy T5 (Cycling) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that surface water run-off could not be managed closer to its source in line with the drainage hierarchy, as such the proposed surface water drainage strategy could lead to a greater likelihood of flooding. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy SI 13 (Sustainable Drainage) of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM4 of Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and\rParagraph 167 of the NPPF."
