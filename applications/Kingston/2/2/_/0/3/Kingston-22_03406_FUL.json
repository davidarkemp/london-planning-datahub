    "The proposed development, due to its position, size and scale, would appear at odds with the established pattern of development within the immediate vicinity of the site. Furthermore, the design of the proposed dwelling would be out of character with the surrounding context. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 8 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed development by virtue of the proposed scale, bulk and height would result in an incongruous addition to this backland site, which would not be in keeping with the surrounding area, resulting in a jarring feature, which would result in a materially harmful impact to the amenities afforded to adjoining neighbouring residential dwellings in terms of sense of visual dominance and overbearing. The proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS8 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "Bedroom two to the first floor measures approximately 9.2sqm and, as such, would not be compliant with minimum floorspace standards for double occupancy. In this way, the proposed accommodation would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of the dwelling, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information with regards to access to the application site. As such, Officers are not able to properly conclude that the proposed development would not result in adverse/unsafe highways conditions, particularly for pedestrian users.  As such, the proposals are found to be contrary to Paragraphs 110, 111 and 112 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012."
