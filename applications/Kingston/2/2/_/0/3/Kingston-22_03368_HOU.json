    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Prior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), a final detailed drainage design, including drawings, supporting calculations, SuDS Statement and Drainage Assessment Form shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components must also be submitted to demonstrate how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The system shall be implemented and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r \rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021, the Sustainable Design and Construction SPG 2014, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems 2015 and policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.
