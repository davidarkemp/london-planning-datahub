    "The proposed development would be an inelegant and bulky addition which would be incongruous in an area where development is largely at the two-storey level with consistent eaves, roof heights and building proportions. The resulting building would appear visually intrusive and incongruous and would not be sympathetic to local character or the surrounding built environment and would not add to the overall quality of the area contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Condition A.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Flats 1 at the fourth and fifth floor levels would fail to comply with the minimum floor areas set out within the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015, contrary to 3(9A), 'Permitted Development', of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In the absence of cogent evidence or robust assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that overspill car parking from the site (resulting from insufficient on-site car parking spaces) would not adversely impact on-street car parking stress and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of any cogent evidence to the contrary, it is considered that the proposed development would likely result in a significant loss of daylight/sunlight to habitable room windows and rear amenity spaces of Nos. 2 & 4 Elmbridge Avenue due  to the increased height and bulk of development in close proximity to the south of these properties. The total loss of the primary outdoor amenity space for existing occupants of Perak Court would unacceptably harm their amenities/living conditions, contrary to A.2(1)(g) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development includes the construction of additional storeys other than on the principal part of the building, contrary to A.1 (d) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed floor to ceiling heights of the additional storeys would exceed the floor to ceiling heights of the storeys of the existing building, contrary to A.1 (e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to any existing and proposed plant on the building. As such, it has not been demonstrated that the development would comply with A.1 (k) and (l) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
