As such, the proposal is in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed car parking space would be provided with sufficient visibility splays so as to protect pedestrian (especially children) and highway safety when vehicles access and egress, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
