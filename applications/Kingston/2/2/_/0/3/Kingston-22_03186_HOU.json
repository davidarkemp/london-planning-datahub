    "By reason of its bulk, scale, and design the proposed two storey side extension with hip-to-gable roof extension, would add significant bulk to the proposed dwelling and would visually appear to fill the application site, eroding the characteristic gaps between the properties. The proposal would therefore appear overly dominant and incongruous additions to the host property which would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
