The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013), Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and the NPPF (2021)."
