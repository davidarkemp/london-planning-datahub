  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would fail to provide adequate quantum of internal floorspace, the required ceiling to floor height and adequate quantity and quality of rear amenity space for the 3 bedroom dwelling. Therefore, it is considered that the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for the future occupants of the 3 bedroom dwelling and as such fail to accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), and NPPF 2021.",
    "Given the scale and lack of set in from the boundary, the proposed two storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would overwhelm the host property and visually fill up the application site which would not appear in keeping with the established pattern of development in the area. In these regards, the proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "Given that the on-site car parking for the 2 bedroom flat would be accessed via a narrow entrance, would use the rear amenity space of the 3 bedroom dwelling and would not have the internal space to safely accommodate car parking space, it is considered that the proposal would result in unsafe conditions for the occupants of the 2 bed flat and would result in an unacceptable impact on highway safety. The applicant has also failed to provide cogent information, or a suitable mechanism to secure the proposed 3 bedroom dwelling as 'car free', to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in inconsiderate parking, increased on-street car parking pressure and an unacceptable impact on highway safety in conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to refuse/recycling storage for the 3 bed dwelling, and an overprovision of refuse/recycling storage has been provided for the 2 bed flat. Given the constraints on site,  it is unsure that proposed development could provide adequate refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers which would not impede on the amenity provision on site, or impede pedestrian or vehicle movement, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r"
