    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and consistent evidence or robust justification that the existing community facility is no longer needed, that it has been vacant and marketed for a community use without success, or it can be re-provided elsewhere or in a different way. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM 24 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed development makes most efficient use of this brownfield site, contrary to para 119 of the NPPF and GG2 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposed building, by reason of its design, form, building line, dominant top floor, choice of materials, car dominated appearance and poorly sited nursery amenity space is considered to represent a poor quality, incongruous and overcomplicated design that fails to respond positively to the surrounding townscape along Ewell Road and Fairmead, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal, by reason of poor quality outlook and privacy to ground floor habitable rooms facing Fairmead, No. 1 Fairmead and the proposed nursery building, no direct access to communal amenity space and lack of private amenity space, is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the ground floor windows of Flats 1 and 2 facing the nursery building would be served by adequate levels of daylight, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Given the site's sustainable location, the applicant has failed to demonstrate through a Transport Statement and Parking Survey that an appropriate level of off-street parking is being provided for the nursery and residential uses and the proposed parking spaces fail to meet the minimum width requirements and result in the loss of existing street trees. For these reasons, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would represent a sustainable form of development or that vehicles could safely enter/egress the site in forward gear without harm to pedestrian or highway safety, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Crossover Policy (2020).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm protected species and their habitats, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of the loss of on-site trees, existing street trees and the absence of information to demonstrate that these trees could not be retained through a revised site layout, is considered to result in harm to the local townscape, contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan and DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy."
