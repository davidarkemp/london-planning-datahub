    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension would be in conflict with condition 6 of planning permission ref 30319 which removes permitted development rights for any extensions to the dwelling.  As such, planning permission granted by Article 3 the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 is not applicable. The proposed development would therefore require planning permission in accordance with Section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r"
