    "The proposed front boundary treatment in terms of its height, scale, design and siting would be an incongruous addition to the property and would also be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the Ullswater Crescent streetscene and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC). The proposal would also result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance and significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC), which is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate with the submission of a detailed Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Arboricultural Method Statement and associated Tree Protection Plan demonstrating how the re-landscaping to the rear is achievable without causing significant harm to the trees which would conflict with Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2012 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate with the submission of details of the proposed ground heights in the residential garden at the rear of the property that the proposed landscaping would not result in significant increased overlooking of the neighbouring occupiers at no.53 and no.57 Ullswater Crescent resulting in a loss of privacy and would cause undue harm to the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers, contrary to policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012"
