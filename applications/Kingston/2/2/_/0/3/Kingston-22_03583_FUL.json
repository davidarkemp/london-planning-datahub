    "The proposal would increase the overall bulk and massing of the building to a harmful extent to the Cadogan Road Conservation Area. The combined design, height and materiality of the proposed development would result in an incongruous addition, extending the height beyond the maximum building height range evident within Uxbridge Road, which fails to respect the general pattern of development of this part of the Cadogan Road Conservation Area and harm the setting of the locally listed building, adjacent.  In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraphs 130, 197, 203, 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed residential unit provides a substandard quality of accommodation by virtue of its absence of any dedicated built-in storage space for the proposed residential units, which is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The submitted Fire Strategy has been found to be inaccurate and insufficient in its content for officers to rely upon to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of sufficiently detailed information, officers cannot be certain that the proposed development is provided with adequate cycle storage, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of sufficiently detailed information, officers cannot properly assess the impact of the proposed development upon refuse and recycling facilities, contrary to Policy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the RBK Residential Design SPD, 2013."
