    "The development would result in the loss of commercial / employment floorspace and premises. The applicant has not submitted any sound evidence or rigorous marketing to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. As such, there would be an unjustified loss of employment land / premises contrary to Policies DM17 and DM19 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012, Policies E1, E2 and E9 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF 2021. \r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal could not provide outdoor amenity space, and that no amenity space would be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development within the area. This would result in a substandard form of accommodation space, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF 2021.",
    "By reason of scale and design the proposed openings to the front elevation would appear an inappropriate addition to a residential use, and would appear out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of residential development within the surrounding area, and would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021."
