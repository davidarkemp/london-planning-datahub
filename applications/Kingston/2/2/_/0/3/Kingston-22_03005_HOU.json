    "The proposed first floor side extension would result in an overly prominent two-storey development that would project far forward of the established two-storey building line shared with Garrison Lane properties. The elevated position of the application site would exacerbate the prominence of the development such that it would appear visually intrusive and dominant within the street scene, detracting from the relatively open character of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
