    "By reason of the projecting front extension, the proposed development would appear excessive in scale, visually dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 7 Milner Road, by reason of an unacceptable loss of daylight, loss of direct sunlight, overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no. 7 Milner Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021."
