    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in an incompatible development which would prejudice the long-term, ongoing feasible use of the ground floor and neighbouring units for commercial operations. In the absence of such information, the proposals are therefore found to be in conflict with Paragraph 187 of the NPPF, 2021 and Policy D13 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate private and communal amenity space below required space standards for new developments, contrary to Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Residential Design Guide, Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
