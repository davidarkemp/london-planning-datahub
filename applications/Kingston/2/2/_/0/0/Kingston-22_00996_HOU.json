    "The proposed gates and boundary treatment located immediately adjacent to the pavement would provide inadequate visibility splays to the detriment of other highway users such as pedestrians and cyclists. It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not impinge highway safety and as such, the proposal is contrary to Policy T2 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposed gates, by reason of their design, height and materials, would bring about a solid and impermeable appearance that would erode the generally verdant character and appearance of the surrounding area and would result in harm to the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. As such, the proposal is in conflict with the NPPF, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM 12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
