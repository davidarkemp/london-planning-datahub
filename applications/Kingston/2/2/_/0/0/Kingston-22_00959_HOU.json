    "The application is not supported by an Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan and as such the applicant has failed to demonstrated that the adjacent trees in particular those subject of a Tree Preservation Order would not be harmed as a result of the proposed development and subsequently be damaged or lost to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area.  The proposal therefore would not be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed blank street street elevation and bin store by virtue of their size, siting and design would be an incongruous addition to the frontage of the host property and be visually intrusive in the streetscene to the detriment of the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. As such it is considered that the proposed bin store would be contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the loss of a two car double garage would not increase on street parking demand that would in turn lead to congestion on the local highway network and therefore prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposed development would not be in accordance with policy DM 9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
