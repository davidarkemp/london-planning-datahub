The proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building, wider area and the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character contraty to Policies DM10, DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012), D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not lead to the loss of a car parking space and contribute to traffic congestion/inconsiderate parking in the surrounding area and have an unacceptable impact upon highway safety, thereby conflicting with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and T.6 of the London Plan 2021."
