    "The proposal would fail to provide an adequate quality of private, outdoor amenity space for the new dwelling. The proposal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide an adequate mix of residential units and would result in the loss of a 3 bedroom dwelling (a dwelling capable of occupation by a family) at a time when the Council has an overriding need for 3 bedroom plus units, as evidenced in the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016. The proposal would not accord with Policy H10 of the London Plan (2021) and DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to provide cogent information to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in inconsiderate parking, increased on-street car parking pressure, traffic congestion and an unacceptable impact on highway safety in conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policy T4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012). This holds significant weight against the proposal."
