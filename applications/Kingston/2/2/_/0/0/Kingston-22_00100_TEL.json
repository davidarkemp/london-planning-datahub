    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance and in particular its height would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with but detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
