  "decision_conditions": [
    "By reason of its design, excessive scale, insufficient set down and insufficient set in, the proposed rear dormer roof extension would dominate the rear roofslope and would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Absent clear evidence demonstrating how the ground floor business uses the rear amenity space and the impact the proposed development would have on access to that space, there is a concern that the business could be negatively impacted by the development. This in turn, absent cogent evidence to the contrary, could have an impact on the viability of the business, which could impact on the vitality of the wider shopping parade. The development is therefore contrary to policy DM19 of the RBK Core  Strategy 2012."
