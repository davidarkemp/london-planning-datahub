    "The proposal would result in a cramped and contrived form of development. It would also erode the spaciousness of this corner plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and as such detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation and outlook for future occupiers by virtue of the predominantly single-aspect and partially sunken layout of the dwelling. In addition, there is no technical Daylight and Sunlight Report to demonstrate adequate daylight and sunlight levels to the proposed dwellinghouse. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of a Basement Impact Assessment to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm to local groundwater conditions or result in structural instability, contrary to Policy Guidance 43 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013."
