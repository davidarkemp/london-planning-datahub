    "The proposed part single, part two-storey side extension with associated changes to roof height, roof form and fenestration would be excessive, incongruous and overly dominant. These aspects of the proposed development would not relate well to the exsiting dwelling and not only destroy its original character, but would be at odds with the character and appearance of neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "As a result of the proposed loss of the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling, the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development could adequately accommodate 1 off-street car parking space and would not result in an unacceptable impact upon traffic congestion, inconsiderate parking in the surrounding area and highway safety, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r"
