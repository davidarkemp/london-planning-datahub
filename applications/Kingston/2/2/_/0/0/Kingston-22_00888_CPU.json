    "The proposed installation of two windows to the side elevation would be in conflict with condition 3 of planning permission ref 07/16533/FUL which removes permitted development rights for installation of windows in the north-western wall of the side extension. As such, planning permission granted by Article 3 the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 is not applicable. The proposed development would therefore require planning permission in accordance with Section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
