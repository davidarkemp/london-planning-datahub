    "The proposed single storey rear extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of its excessive depth. Combined with its siting along the shared boundaries of the site the proposal is not considered not to represent a development that respects the existing pattern of development, and the built form of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\r",
