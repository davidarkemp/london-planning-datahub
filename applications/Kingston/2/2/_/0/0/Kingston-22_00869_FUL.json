    "No mechanism has been submitted to secure the proposed development as 'car free' and it has not been demonstrated that the development would not increase congestion and on-street car parking stress which could adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
