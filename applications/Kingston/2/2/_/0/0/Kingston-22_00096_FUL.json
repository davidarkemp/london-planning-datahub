Noise levels in bedrooms should also not normally exceed 45 dB LAmax,F more than 10 times during the night time. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. The approved scheme shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for the occupants of the development, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThese details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and the details are likely to affect the design of other elements of the scheme.\r",
