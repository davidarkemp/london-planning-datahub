    "By reason of its insufficient set back, the proposed side extension would result in a loss of prominence of the existing cat-slide roof feature of the property. Additionally, the proposed lack of a set down from the ridge line of the dwellinghouse would ensure the proposed development would not appear subordinate to the dwelling, and would significantly unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties. The proposed development is considered not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the immediate surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character. This harm would not be outweighed against any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed increase in height of the single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 75 Woodlands Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
