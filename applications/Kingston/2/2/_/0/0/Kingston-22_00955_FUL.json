    "Given the height and proximity of the proposed two storey double garage to neighbouring properties 10, 16 and 18 Broomfield Road, as well as 1-3 Derby Road, officers consider that the proposal with windows at first floor level facing to the rear, side and front elevations, would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy and undue sense of enclosure for the occupants of these neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of scale and design, the proposed double garage would appear overly bulky and prominent within the immediate surrounding area, and would not relate well to prevailing pattern and form of development within the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
