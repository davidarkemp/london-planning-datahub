    "The proposed upvc window frames are not appropriate for use in a Conservation Area and would further erode the character and appearance of the application property, and would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Oak Hill Conservation Area. The applicant has also failed to provide sufficient information e.g. detailed drawings and manufacturers details regarding the replacement windows. The proposal would therefore detract and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 and the NPPF (2021)."
