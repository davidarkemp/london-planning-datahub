    "The applicant is reminded that no construction-related vehicles (including those belonging to private contractors) are permitted to park on any residential road in the vicinity of the site, other than in a pay-and display bay in accordance with any time restrictions. Wherever possible, contractors should travel by public transport, walking or cycling.\r\rThe applicant is advised that it is their responsibility to ensure that all relevant highways permits (e.g. scaffolding, hoarding, oversailing, tower crane) and temporary traffic management orders as may be required are put in place at the appropriate times.\r\rThe applicant must contact the Highways Crossover Officer to arrange for a strengthened vehicle crossover to be installed prior to the access being used by construction vehicles.\r\rNo work must be undertaken on the public highway without a Section 278 agreement being in place. No materials must be stored on the public highway unless this has been expressly permitted by RBK Highways.\r\rThe applicant should also contact the Highways Inspections Team to arrange for a highway condition survey to be undertaken before commencing these works.\r\rRBK Highways may from time to time advise the applicant that changes should be made to the routing of construction traffic and the applicant must abide by any such requests, even where these represent a departure from what has been previously stated in the CMP/CLP.\r\rReason : For the avoidance of doubt."
