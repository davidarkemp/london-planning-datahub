    "The proposal would be in conflict with condition 11 of planning permission ref 94/3144/FUL which removes permitted development rights for extensions including roof extensions. As such, planning permission granted by Article 3 the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 is not applicable. The proposed development would therefore require planning permission in accordance with Section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\rPlanning permission 94/3144/FUL condition 11 states the following:\r\rNotwithstanding the provision of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order, 1995 (or any other Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no extensions (including porches or dormer windows) to the dwelling house or buildings shall be erected within the curtilage.\r\rReason: To safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard the cohesive appearance of the development."
