    "The proposed balustrading and shed type roof structure would be incongruous and erode the coherent appearance shared between Nos. 168 to 146 Grand Avenue, thereby eroding the positive contribution that these properties make to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 & HC1 of the London Plan 2021, paragraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 & DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed roof terrace would be uncharacteristic of the area and would result in unacceptable overlooking and a loss of privacy to neighbours, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021)."
