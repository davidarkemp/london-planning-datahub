There should also be a preference for green over grey features, in line with the following drainage hierarchy\r\r1) rainwater use as a resource (for example rainwater harvesting, blue roofs for irrigation)\r2) rainwater infiltration to ground at or close to source\r3) rainwater attenuation in green infrastructure features for gradual release (for example green roofs, rain gardens)\r4) rainwater discharge direct to a watercourse (unless not appropriate)\r5) controlled rainwater discharge to a surface water sewer or drain\r6) controlled rainwater discharge to a combined sewer."
