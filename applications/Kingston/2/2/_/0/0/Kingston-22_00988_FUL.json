    "The proposal would fail to provide an adequate quality of internal accommodation. The proposal would not provide adequate outlook for all bedrooms at ground and first floor level, or adequate levels of privacy for the bedrooms at first floor level. The proposal would also not provide adequate ceiling to floor heights. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Given the inappropriate siting of the recycling and waste facilities to the front of the site, and lack of details regarding the storage of these facilities, officers are not convinced that the proposal would not result in a visual nuisance given that the proposal would be highly visible on the Ewell Road streetscene or impede pedestrian movement on collection day.  This would be contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, CS9and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The development would result in the loss of commercial / employment floorspace and premises. The applicant has not submitted any sound evidence or rigorous marketing over a number of years to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for this size of employment use. As such, there would be an unjustified loss of employment land / premises contrary to Policy DM 17 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, inconsiderate parking, and increased on-street car parking pressure which could harm pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r"
