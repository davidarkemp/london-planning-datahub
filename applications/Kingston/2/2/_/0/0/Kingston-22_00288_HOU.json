    "By reason of its excessively bulky appearance and flat roof form, the proposed first floor rear extension considered not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the immediate surrounding area, appearing as an incongruous addition, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 7 Malvern Road in terms of daylight/sunlight, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
