    "Due to the excessive depth and siting of the proposed single storey rear extension on the shared boundary with No. 21 Wingfield Road, officers consider that the proposed extension would result in an undue sense of overbearing and loss of outlook for the occupants for No. 21 Wingfield Raod. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of scale and siting, the proposed ground floor rear extension would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
