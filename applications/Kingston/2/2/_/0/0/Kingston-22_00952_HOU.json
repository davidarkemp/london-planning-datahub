    "The proposed development, by reason of its width, design and massing would not appear subordinate or proportionate to the dwellinghouse, and would sit uncomfortably along the junction of Ewell Road and Warren Drive and would detract from the open setting of the corner plot and would represent an incongruous form of development within the street scene of Ewell Road, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of the inclusion of gable ended, hipped, and pitched roof designs, the roof form of the proposed two storey side extension would not relate well to the dwellinghouse or other properties on Ewell Road and would therefore be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
