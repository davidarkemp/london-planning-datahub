  "decision_conditions": [
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No. 52 Aragon Road, and given the relationship between the properties there is a potential for light loss. As such, the proposal has a real potential to cause an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant is advised to resubmit with additional information addressing Policy Guidance 17 of the RBK Residential Design SPD (the 45 Degree Rule)\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/file/102/residential-design-spd"
