    "The proposed building, by reason of its design, Mansard roof form, footprint and combined height, width and depth, is considered to result in a building of excessive scale and mass that is wholly out of keeping the character of development in the surrounding area and fails to positively respond to the site context, resulting in harm to the local townscape. The proposal is therefore in conflict with CS8, DM10 and DM11, DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",

    "Insufficient has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm protected species and their habitats, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The Protection of Badgers Act (1992) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021)."
