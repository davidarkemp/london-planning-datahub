    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not be subordinate and would create an imbalance to the roofscape of the property and be a dominant and visually intrusive feature when viewed from surrounding properties and detract form the character and appearance of the host property and would result in harm to the surrounding Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character area a non designated heritage asset. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
