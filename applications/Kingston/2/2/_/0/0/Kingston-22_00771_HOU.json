    "The proposed dog grooming building and storage area would be of an excessive height and depth along the shared boundary with, and opposite the rear facing habitable room windows of, No. 19 Bakewell Way which would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact and undue sense of enclosure. Furthermore, insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed use of the building for dog grooming would not result in unacceptable noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed flood defence gates would not increase surface water flood risk elsewhere, contrary to Policies DM4 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 167 of the NPPF (2021)."
