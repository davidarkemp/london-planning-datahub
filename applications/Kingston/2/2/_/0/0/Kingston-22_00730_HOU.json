    "By reason of its scale, siting, design and appearance, the proposed front extension would not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling resulting in an incongruous appearance when viewed within the street scene, which would also disrupt the rhythm and cohesive nature of the wider area of Albany Mews, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area and the Thames - Side Strategic Area of Special Character. This harm would not be outweighed against any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
