  "decision_conditions": [
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 35 & No. 34 Somerset Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"25 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed side and rear extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create a incongrous, dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive. Due to its excessive depth and proximity to the shared boundaries the proposed development would create an undue sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers which would be detrimental to the future living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopyed LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
