    "The proposed extension would encroach upon neighbouring land in regard to both Nos. 13 and 17 Eaton Drive. Therefore, the proposed extension would not constitute development within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse to which this application relates and would not benefit from the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of  the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the materials used for the proposed development would be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. Therefore, the proposed extension would not fall within the parameters of Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.3 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
