    "The proposed development, by virtue of its scale, siting and absence of a setback from the front elevation would create a dominant and incongruous addition which would be visually prominent within the streetscene. This would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the visual amenities of the surrounding area, conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Councils LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013). \r\rIt is also noted the submitted drawings (artist impression) do not accurately reflect the neighbouring extension at No.5 Bearfield Road.\r\r\r"
