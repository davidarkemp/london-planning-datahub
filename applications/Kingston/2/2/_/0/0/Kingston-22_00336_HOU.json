They should be installed in groups of at least three, at a height above 5m height, and preferably with a 5m clearance between the host building and other buildings or\robstructions. Where possible avoid siting them above windows or doors. Swift bricks should be used unless these are not practical due to the nature of construction, in which case alternative designs of suitable swift boxes should be provided in their place.\r\rReason: To enhance the bio diversity of the site and to comply with Policy DM6 of the RBK Core Strategy and Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.\r"
