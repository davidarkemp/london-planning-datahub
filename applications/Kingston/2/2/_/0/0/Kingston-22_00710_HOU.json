    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not adversely impact highway or pedestrian safety through the provision of adequate visibility splays. The lack of set-back of the garage from the pavement could result in vehicles accessing the proposed garage blocking neighbouring driveways and the public highway which would inconvenience neighbours and present an amenity issue, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
