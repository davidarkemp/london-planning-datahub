  "decision_conditions": [
    "Due to the siting and orientation of the proposed extension in relation to the closest opening at ground floor level at No. 229 Red Lion Road, the proposal would not pass the 45-degree elevation test and as such would likely result in a loss of light to the neighbouring property and create an undue sense of enclosure as a result of its overbearing impact. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r"
