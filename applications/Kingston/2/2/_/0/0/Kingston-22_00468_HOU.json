    "By reason of its scale, width, insufficient set back, and insufficient set down, the proposed first floor side extension would not appear subordinate or proportionate the existing dwellinghouse, would be excessive in scale, would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene and would represent a cramped form of development which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its gable ended design, the roof form of the proposed first floor side extension would not relate well to the dwellinghouse or other properties on Reynolds Road which is characterised by hipped roofs, and would therefore be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal would lead to further development to an already significantly developed site, and as such would appear visually oppressive and exacerbate the existing sense of enclosure for neighbouring occupiers, particularly in relation to No. 22 Reynolds Road, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
