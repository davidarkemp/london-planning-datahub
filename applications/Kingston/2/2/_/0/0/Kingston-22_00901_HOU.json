    "The proposed single storey side extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of it not being proportionate and subordinate to the original house and it not being set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm and would sit uncomfortably along the junction of Malden Hill and Malden Hill Gardens. The design of the proposed development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and would detract from the open setting of the corner plot. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
