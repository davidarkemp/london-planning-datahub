Rear roof extension with removal of 3no chimneys and installation of 2no front and 2no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Given the excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of a sense of overbearing into the closest habitable rooms of No. 114 and 118 Elmbridge Avenue thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of its bulk, scale, and design the proposed two storey rear extension and rear roof extension would appear overly dominant and incongruous additions to the host property which would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
