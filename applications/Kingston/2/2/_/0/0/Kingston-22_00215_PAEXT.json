  "decision_conditions": [
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the height of the eaves of the part of the proposed single storey rear extension would not exceed the height of the eaves of the existing dwellinghouse in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 (d) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation. The proposed extension would extend beyond a side elevation and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Due to its its excessive depth along the shared boundary the proposed single storey rear extension would result in an unacceptable overbearing impact and undue sense of enclosure to the nearest ground floor habitable room window of No. 156 Tolworth Rise South, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013. \r"
