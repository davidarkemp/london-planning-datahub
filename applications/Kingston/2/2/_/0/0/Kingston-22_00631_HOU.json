    "Due to the design, materiality, height and excessive bulk and mass of the proposed roof extension and single storey side/rear extension, officers consider it would not appear a proportionate or in keeping addition to the main dwelling and would not relate well to the established character and appearance of the surrounding area, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and  The Drive Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
