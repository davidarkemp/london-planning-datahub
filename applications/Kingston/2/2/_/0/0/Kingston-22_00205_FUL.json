    "The proposed development is inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on openness due to the materially larger development which would be of a discordant height, scale and design within the street scene. No Very Special Circumstances exist which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and other identified harms. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DM5 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "No biodiversity or ecological assessments have been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm protected species and their habitats,  contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The Protection of Badgers Act (1992) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent evidence and consistent plans that the proposed development would not result in a significant loss of daylight or sunlight to No. 11 West Road, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kington Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed on-site car parking spaces would meet the minimum size requirements (4.8m x 2.4m) and that vehicles parking on site would not oversail the footway and impede pedestrian and vehicular movements and adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
