  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed side extension, by reason of its siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling, would visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No.122 Beresford Avenue and would not result in an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
