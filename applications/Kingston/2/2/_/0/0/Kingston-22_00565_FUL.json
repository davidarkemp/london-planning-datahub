    "Due to the design, siting, excessvie bulk and unusual mass of the proposed development, as well as the uncharacteristic subdivision of the plot, the proposal would appear contrived and would not relate well to the original dwelling on site or the surrounding area. Furthermore, the proposal would detract from the established character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The applicationt has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed dwelling would not increase the risk of surface water flooding. As such. the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The applicant has not provided a fire safety strategy and the proposed driveway would not allow sufficient space for an emergency vehicle to safely enter or exist the site, and as such the proposal would not adhere to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021."
