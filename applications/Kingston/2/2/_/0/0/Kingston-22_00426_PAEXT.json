    "The submitted information indicates that, on the balance of probability, the construction of the proposed extension has already commenced, contrary to Condition A.4 (10) of Class A, of Schedule 2, Part 1, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the height of the eaves of the part of the proposed single storey rear extension would not exceed the height of the eaves of the existing dwellinghouse, would not exceed 3 metres in height, and that the total height of the extension would not exceed 4 metres in height, in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 (d), (i) and (g)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation. The total enlargement would extend beyond a side elevation and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the materials used for the proposed rear extension would be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse, in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1 Class A.3 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The scale and proximity of the proposed larger extension to neighbouring habitable room windows is such that there would likely be an unacceptable loss of daylight and sunlight to neighbours. No cogent information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in a significant loss of daylight/sunlight to neighbours, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
