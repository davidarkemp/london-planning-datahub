    "By reason of its design and roof form, the proposed part single, part two storey side extension would not relate well to the host dwelling and would result in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed part single, part two storey side extension would not unduly compromise residential amenity in relation to the closest habitable windows at No. 90 and 92 Mount Pleasant Road at ground and first floor level, resulting in an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. The proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
