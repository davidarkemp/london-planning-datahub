    "The external amenity space would represent a poor quality amenity area below space standards as set out by the Council and in terms of usability, specifically the above ground courtyard sited to the front of the building, and configuration with shared function as a cycle and refuse storage area. In this regard, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset of Cadogan Conservation Area by reason of its siting, bulk, scale, and mass.  This is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposals would also erode the spaciousness and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The proposed development would cause harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage assets of the nearby locally listed buildings, Nos 8-13 St. Leonard's Road. The proposals are found to be contrary in this regard to Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would not be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development and is considered to constitute overdevelopment as it would not incorporate any separation distance from its boundaries, would not address St. Leonard's Road with an active frontage, or provide adequate set-back from the street, thereby creating an uncomfortable relationship with surrounding properties and an incongruous and pinched appearance from the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 and policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, policies CS3, DM10 and DM11 of the Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
