  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed accommodation would not meet the minimum internal space standard for a 1b 2p unit as set out in table 3.3 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed rear extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not be subordinate and would be a dominant and overbearing feature at the rear of the property and be visually intrusive in the views of the site form the surrounding area and would as such detract from the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The porposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed amenity space would not meet the minimum space requirements set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD and as such the proposal would not accord with policies D6 of the London Plan and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in close proximity to the existing 1st floor rear habitable room windows of 10 the Triangle would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure and cause harm to the outlook of the existing neighbouring occupiers and as such the proposal would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not exacerbate existing on-street parking demand or lead to congestion and in turn prejudice highway safety and such the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2021.",
    "The proposed siting and design and proximity of the proposed development to the neighbouring rear gardens of those in Dickerage Road and Arundel Road at the rear of the site would be overlooked by the private amenity space and rear habitable room window of the proposed development resulting in a loss of privacy and would cause detrimental harm to the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers and as such the proposal would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy."
