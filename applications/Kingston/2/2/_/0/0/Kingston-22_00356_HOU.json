  "decision_conditions": [
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed rear/side extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on no.98 Grange Road in terms of daylight/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring windows, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
