    "The proposed first floor rear extension by virtue of its combined siting and uncompatible roof form, would create an incongruous and visually bulky addition to the host property that would detract from the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor rear extension would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest habitable room windows at No. 55 Amberwood Rise and would not result in an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
