    "Insufficient cogent information has been submitted showing a line of Heras Fencing running across the entire rear garden North to South, fully incorporating the Root Protection Area of the TPO Lime tree in the South Eastern corner of the property. A Tree Protection Plan drawn by an Arboricultural Consultant needs to be submitted prior to determination in order to ensure the proposed development would not have a detrimental impact on trees which contribute to the character and appearance of the application site and the immediate surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance set out in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013."
