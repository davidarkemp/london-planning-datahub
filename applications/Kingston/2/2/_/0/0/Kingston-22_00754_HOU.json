    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension, together with the hip-to-gable extension, would by virtue of its excessive size, siting and design create a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
