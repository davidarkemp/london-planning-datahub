    "The proposed gates would be a retrograde step and introduce more solidity to the existing boundary treatment which would not only fail to preserve but would erode the generally consistent verdant character and appearance of the surrounding area and, as such, would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. No public benefit has been identified that would outweigh the harm. The Proposal is contrary to Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "The proposed dropped kerb together with the retained boundary treatment located immediately adjacent to the pavement would provide inadequate visibility splays to the detriment of other highway users such as pedestrians and cyclists. It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not impinge highway safety and as such, the proposal is contrary to Policy T2 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021."
