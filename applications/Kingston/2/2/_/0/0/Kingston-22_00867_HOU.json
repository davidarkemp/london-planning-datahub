    "By reason of the set-back of only 200 mm from the front elevation, the proposed flat roof form not being consistent with the existing roof slope of the original dwelling, and the proximity to the shared boundary with No. 133 Tolworth Rise North, the proposed two storey side extension would appear as a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, it would erode the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in Tolworth Rise North and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
