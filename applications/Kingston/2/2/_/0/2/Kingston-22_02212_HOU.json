  "description": "Erection of a single-storey rear/side extension following demolition of existing rear conservatory and detached shed\r\rThe proposed extension will extend out 5 meters from the existing rear external wall and will also wrap around the right hand side (north facing) of the house with a 1m gap to the boundary to allow for side access to the existing front side access gate. The entire length of the new rear extension including the side on it's rear elevation will be 8088mm which is longer than half the the original width of the existing house. \r\rThe construction of the proposed extension will consist of timber, conventional masonry construction (brick and blockwork) a flat 'warm deck' roof with two lights and structural steels to support the existing rear masonry wall of the house to allow a spacious opening into the proposed floor area. \r\rThe proposed 'wrap around' extension will accomodate a new utility room, kitchen and dining area which will integrate into the existing footprint of the house.",

    "By reason of its excessive depth, coupled with its height and siting along the shared boundary, the proposed single storey rear extension would have an overbearing appearance to adjoining property, No. 13 Ronelean Road Elton Road. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 13 Ronelean Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r \rThe applicant is advised to resubmit with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Policy Guidance 17 of the RBK Residential Design guide has been taken into account.\r \rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/file/102/residential-design-spd"
