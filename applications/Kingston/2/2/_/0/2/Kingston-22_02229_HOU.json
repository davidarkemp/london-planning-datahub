    "The proposed rear extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create a incongrous, dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive. Due to its excessive height and proximity to the shared boundaries the proposed development would create an undue sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers which would be detrimental to the future living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 19 & No. 23 Ellerton Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
