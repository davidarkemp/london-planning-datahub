    "The proposed first floor rear extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of it being flat roofed and would sit uncomfortably close to the junction of Malden Hill and Malden Hill Gardens. The design of the proposed development would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property and would detract from the open setting of the corner plot and the street scene. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
