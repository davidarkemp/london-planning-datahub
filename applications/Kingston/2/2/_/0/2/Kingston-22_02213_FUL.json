    "The proposal by virtue of its design would be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed accommodation would be of a substandard nature and would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards for a three storey 3-bed dwelling set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation future residents in respect of floor to ceiling heights across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation future residents in respect of substandard built in storage contrary to internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The external amenity space would be undersized against the criteria set out for new dwellinghouses in the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013. Based on the information submitted, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development would lead to a material intensification of the access and this is likely to prejudice highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
