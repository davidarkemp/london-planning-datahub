    "The development has been assessed against the provisions of Class MA of Schedule 2 Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and found to comply with those provisions",
    "Prior to commencement of any development on site, a Construction Management Plan detailing the following:\r(a)\tProvision for loading/unloading materials.\r(b)\tStorage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles.\r(c)\tSigning system for works traffic.\r(d)\tMeasures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works.\r(e)\tMeans of enclosure of the site.\r(f)\tWheel washing equipment.\r(g)\tThe parking of vehicles of the site operatives and visitors\r(h)\tThe erection and maintenance of security hoarding.\rshall be submitted to the planning authority for written agreement. The development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the construction management plan, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Before the development is commenced a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the noise level of 35 dB LAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dB LAeq,8 hour during the night time (2300 to 0700 hours) in bedrooms, in accordance with BS8233:2014, shall not be exceeded. Noise levels in bedrooms should also not normally exceed 45 dB LAmax,F more than 10 times during the night time. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should\rbe provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for occupiers, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
