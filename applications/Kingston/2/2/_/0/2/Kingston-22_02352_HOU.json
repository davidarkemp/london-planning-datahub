    "By reason of scale, design and siting, the proposed two storey side extension and partial hip-to-gable roof extension would appear excessive in scale and an inappropriate form of development, which would not relate well to the host dwelling. Further, given that the proposal would erode the characteristic gaps between dwellings in the immediate area, the proposal would result in a 'terracing effect', which would erode the prevailing character and appearance of the surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed development is inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on openness due to the materially larger development which would be of a discordant height, scale and design within the street scene. No Very Special Circumstances exist which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and other identified harms. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DM5 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r"
