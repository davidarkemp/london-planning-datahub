    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of any cogent assessment or information that established noise and other nuisance generating commercial uses in the vicinity would remain viable and could continue to grow without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them as a result of the proposed development contrary to Policy D13 of the London Plan (2021), the NPPF (2021) and Policy DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and fenestration, would enclose the existing first and second floor flats on the site and offer unrestricted views into its living spaces, depriving occupants of daylight, sunlight, outlook and privacy and would create an undue sense of enclosure. It is considered that this would result in unacceptable living conditions for the occupiers of these properties, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The development is of a poor quality of design and would have a bulky and monolithic appearance which would detract from the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policies DM10 and DM11 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan and the NPPF (2021)."
