    "By reason of the scale the proposed development would appear incongruous and would therefore have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the existing building. Consequently, it is considered that the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
