    "By reason of the scale and proximity of the proposed extension to the rear of no.30 Kingsdowne Road, the proposed development, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no.30 Kingsdowne Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to this adjoining property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
