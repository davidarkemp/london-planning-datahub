    "The proposal would fail to provide the minimum required quantum of internal floorspace and, as such, the proposed dwelling would provide a substandard form of accommodation for the proposed dwelling and therefore fail to accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), and NPPF 2021",
    "Given that the on-site car parking could not be delivered such that each car parking space could be accessed independently, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, inconsiderate parking, and increased on-street car parking pressure which could harm pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The removal of the front boundary wall and provision of a car parking space in the configuration proposed within a very limited space in the front garden, appears cramped, contrived and car dominated. The proposal  would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area in conflict with the NPPF 2021, Policies D3  of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient details have been provided with regards to the access and collection of the refuse/recycling storage. The proposal could result in the refuse storage overhanging the pedestrian pavement and adding to the cluttered appearance. This would be in conflict with  the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, CS9, and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012, and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013."
