    "The proposed rear extension would be in conflict with condition 5 of planning permission ref 27876 which removes permitted development rights for extensions including roof extensions. As such, planning permission granted by Article 3 the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 is not applicable. The proposed development would therefore require planning permission in accordance with Section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The proposed rear extension does not exceed the limits set in Paragraph A.1(f) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and therefore the application for Prior Notification of Larger Home Extension is not the correct procedure."
