    "The proposal would result in a net loss of employment floorspace and it has not been demonstrated by sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses, contrary to Policy DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies E1 and E2 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent information and a completed legal agreement that the proposed development would not exceed the maximum car parking standards, would encourage sustainable modes of transport and would not contribute towards congestion and exacerbate on street car parking stress, contrary to Policy DM9 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021).\r",
    "The lack of private amenity space and the absence of section drawings to demonstrate compliance with the minimum 2.5m floor to ceiling height mean that it has not been demonstrated that the proposed accommodation would be of a good standard, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston  Core Strategy (2012) and Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal which concerns the net loss of employment floorspace, the proposed dwelling would exceed the minimum GIA requirements for a unit of this type. A three bedroom unit, for which there is significant objectively assessed need, could be delivered. The proposed development would therefore fail to make the most efficient use of land, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
