    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or cause material overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 7 Fernhill Gardens. \r\rThe submitted plans demonstrates that the proposal would introduce a large extension in terms of both height and depth along the shared boundary. Given the scale of the proposal it is likely that it would result in a detrimental impact to the amenities of the neighbours by reason of loss of light and overbearing impact. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The extension by reason of its scale and design would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would appear as an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAs such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
