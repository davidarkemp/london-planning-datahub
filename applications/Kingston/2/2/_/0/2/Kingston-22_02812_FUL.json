    "The proposed roof extensions, by reason of its design, combined footprint, height, width and depth  is out of scale and proportion to the host buildings, resulting  in a buildings of excessive scale and mass that is out of keeping with the character of development in the surrounding area and fails to positively respond to the site context, resulting in harm to the local townscape and the setting of the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore in conflict with CS8, DM10 and DM11, DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies D3 and HC1 of The London Plan (2021) and paragraphs 202 of  National Planning  Policy Framework (2021).\r",
    "The proposed four bedroom residential dwelling is located adjacent to noise generating commercial uses. No detailed Noise Assessment has been submitted and no  mitigation measures have been proposed to address  this issue of noise and disturbance to future residents. In the absence of such detail, it is considered that the proposed residential accommodation could be subject to potential noise disturbance  to the detriment of future occupiers which could also impact on the viability of the adjacent commercial uses. The proposal therefore fails to comply with Policies D3 and D13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM13 Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and paragraphs 130 and 187 of the National Planning  Policy Framework (2021). \r"
