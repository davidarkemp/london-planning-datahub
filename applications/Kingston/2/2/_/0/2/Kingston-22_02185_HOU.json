    "By reason of scale, height, and design, the proposed side extension would appear dominant and displaced from the wider area and would not relate well to the features of the host dwelling, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or cause material overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 165 and No. 169 Beresford Avenue. The proposed site plan demonstrates that the proposal could result in a significant impact to the amenities of the neighbour. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
