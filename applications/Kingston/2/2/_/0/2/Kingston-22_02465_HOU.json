    "The proposed development, by reason of its combined depth and siting hard up against the shared boundary would result in an overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure to the occupants of neighbouring property, No. 32 Bonner Hill Road. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 32 Bonner Hill Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to its excessive depth the proposed single storey rear extension would neither be proportionate or subordinate and therefore not relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate surrounding area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
