    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring properties and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would erode the spaciousness of the plot and create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers with the proposed development appearing cramped detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area and the amenity of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate by way of a daylight/sunlight analysis that the proposed development would not result in a loss of daylight/sunlight that would cause demonstrable harm and diminish the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed 1st and 2nd floor bedroom windows by virtue of the their orientation and siting would lead to increased overlooking of the property to the rear 24 A Elm Road resulting in a loss of privacy that would be detrimental to the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
