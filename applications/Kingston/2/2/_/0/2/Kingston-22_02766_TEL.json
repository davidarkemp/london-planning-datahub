    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its inappropriate siting and appearance would create an incongruous addition to the host property (the fire station tower) that would be a dominant and overbearing feature, create visual clutter and be visually intrusive in the long views from the surrounding public realm and the private views from the rear of the properties in Tudor Drive detracting from  the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area and cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the non designated heritage asset the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
