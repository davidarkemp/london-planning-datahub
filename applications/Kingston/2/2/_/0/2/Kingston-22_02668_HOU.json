    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting, massing and roof form, would create an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Eton Road street scene and would also unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r"
