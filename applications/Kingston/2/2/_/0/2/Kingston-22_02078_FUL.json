    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed hip to gable and rear dormer extension, when considered cumulatively, would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed siting of the roof extensions would reduce the characteristic gaps between the properties and adversely impact the openness of the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the cumulative impact of the proposed roof extensions would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
