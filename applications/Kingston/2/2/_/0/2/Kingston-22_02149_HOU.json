    "By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed development would not appear subordinate to the host dwelling and is considered not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the immediate surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Park Road Conservation Area. This harm would not be outweighed against any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013)."
