    "The development is inappropriate in the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on openness due to the discordant raised site levels, additional buildings and hardstanding. No considerations exist which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and other identified harms so as to amount to very special circumstances. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DM5 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "No biodiversity or ecological assessments have been submitted to demonstrate that the development does not harm protected species and their habitats, including the Bonesgate Stream SINC, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The Protection of Badgers Act (1992) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent evidence that the development does not increase flood risk elsewhere, has no adverse impact on water resources and that the development does not pose an existing or potential pollution risk to the environment, contrary to Policies DM1, DM4 and DM10 of the Kington Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The development erodes the well-greened semi-rural character of the area and has an urbanising effect, contrary to Policies DM4 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
