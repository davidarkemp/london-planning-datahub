    "It is considered that the collection of roof forms would  not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding maisonettes and would disturb the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property resulting in a jarring and incongruous appearance which would have an unacceptable impact on the existing  street scene. Furthermore, due to its siting and scale, the proposed side dormer would reduce characteristic separation gaps between the properties resulting in an unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. Given the above the proposed side dormer roof extension is in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD."
