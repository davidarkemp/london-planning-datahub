    "Given the lack of outlook for all habitable rooms, as well as the lack of robust evidence demonstrating that the kitchen duct and ventilation system would not result in undue noise and disturbance for the future occupiers, alongside the lack of external amenity space, the proposal would provide a substandard level of accommodation. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with The NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of scale and inappropriate design the proposed two storey rear extension would appear an inappropriate addition to the host property that would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, thereby conflicting with the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Given the lack of information regarding the siting of the recycling and waste facilities for the proposed dwelling, officers consider that the proposal would likely result in a cramped appearance to the front of the site, and a visual nuisance on collection day. This would be contrary to The NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety. The proposed development would result in an increased demand for on-street parking in an area that has limited capacity. Additional on-street parking pressures could harm pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r"
