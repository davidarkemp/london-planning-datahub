    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The rating level of the noise determined by the cumulative sound emissions of the plant to which this permission relates shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade and the measurements and assessment shall be made according to BS 4142:2014.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Prior to any above ground works (excluding demolition) a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.

The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "No A/C unit shall be installed until the details of the A/C unit including the appearance of the unit and the acoustic impact and proposed mitigation have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. No A/C unit shall be installed other than in accordance with the approved details. The A/C unit shall be maintained in accordance with the manufacturer's specification.  \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
