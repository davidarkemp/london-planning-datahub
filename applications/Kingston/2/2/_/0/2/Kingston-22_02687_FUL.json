Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Given the inappropriate siting of the recycling and waste facilities to the front of the application site in a highly visible location, officers consider that the proposal would give rise to a visual nuisance and would impede pedestrian movement especially on collection day.  This would be contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, CS 9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The development would result in the loss of commercial / employment floorspace and premises. The applicant has not submitted any sound evidence or rigorous marketing over a number of years to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for this size of employment use. As such, there would be an unjustified loss of employment land / premises contrary to Policy DM 17 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety. The proposed development would result in an increased demand for on-street parking in an area that has limited capacity. Additional on-street parking pressures could harm pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
