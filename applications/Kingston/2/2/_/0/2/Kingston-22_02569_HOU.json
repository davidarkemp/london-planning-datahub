    "The proposed two storey rear element of the proposal by reason of its siting, excessive bulk, scale and mass and lack of sufficient separation distance would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property No 126 Hamilton Avenue by reason of an overbearing appearance. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
