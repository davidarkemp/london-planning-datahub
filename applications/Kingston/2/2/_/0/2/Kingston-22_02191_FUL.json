    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no additions or enlargements to any dwellinghouse(s) on the site (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) shall be erected unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no detached buildings (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) shall be erected on the site unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a landscaping and planting scheme, including a scaled plan showing the location of all planting and the size at time of planting, shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rGiven the ancillary nature of the annexe accommodation the submitted landscaping scheme shall not provide for any landscaping to separate the gardens of the retained dwelling and the annexe accommodation.\r\rAny trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced during the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the dwellinghouse, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter.\r\rThe developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI.7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development hereby approved have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  These facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The car parking shown on the approved plans shall be provided with a hard-bound, adequately-drained, dust-free surface prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained and kept free from obstruction thereafter. It shall not be used for any purposes other than the parking of vehicles for the occupiers of and visitors to the development.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "During the construction phase of the development, no works (including any deliveries) shall take place on site outside of the following hours:\r08:00 to 18:00 Monday to Friday\r08:00 to 13:00 on Saturdays\rNo works or deliveries whatsoever shall take place on Sundays or bank holidays.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to occupation, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The annexe hereby approved shall be used for purposes ancillary to the main dwellinghouse. The main dwellinghouse hereby approved shall remain in use as a single dwellinghouse and the attached annexe shall not be used, sold or sub-let as a separate dwelling. \r\rReason: This condition requires the annexe accommodation to be ancillary in order to comply with the terms of the application in accordance with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and for the avoidance of doubt. A separate unit of accommodation of this nature may not be acceptable in this location and, in any event, the impacts of a separate dwelling have not been assessed. \r",
    "The ground floor front-facing room of the annexe accommodation is not permitted to be used as a bedroom.\r\rReason:  The subject room does not meet the minimum space standards for a single bedroom (minimum of 7.5sqm). For the avoidance of doubt and in the interests of occupier amenity in accordance with Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021."
