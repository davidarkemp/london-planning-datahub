    "The proposed illuminated sign facing Browns Road woud be located opposite residential properties and would by reason of the level of brightness appear obtrusive resulting a nuisance to these residents. The brightness of the signage is excessive and would exceed the recommended levels within the Professional Lighting Guide 05, The Brightness of Illuminated Advertisements 2014. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) and paragraph 136 of the NPPF (2021)."
