    "The proposed ground and 1st floor rear extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and the terrace in which it forms part of. It would have a depth of 6m (ground) and 3.3 m (1st floor) and would not be be a subordinate addition to the host property and would be a dominant and overbearing visually intrusive feature at the rear of the property  in the private views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties and detract from the character and appearance of the hopst property and the terrace which it forms part of. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Cpre Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an overbearing appearance and sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on daylight/sunlight to the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
