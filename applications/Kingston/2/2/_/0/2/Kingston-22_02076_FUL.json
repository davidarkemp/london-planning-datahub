    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021."
