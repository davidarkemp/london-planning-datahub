    "The proposal would be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and as such detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed siting and design of the residential unit in relation to the donor plot and the run of properties along Willow Road would result in an incongruous addition to the area.  In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation in terms of outlook for future occupiers and natural daylight/sunlight ingress to the principal living accommodation. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The external amenity space would be undersized against the criteria set out for new dwellinghouses in the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013 and would be of a layout and proximity to a high boundary wall which would exacerbate degree of overshadowing to this outside space. Based on the information submitted, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed building, by reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with the dwellinghouse at No. 28A would overbear unacceptably upon the new detached dwelling and its garden areas.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021."
