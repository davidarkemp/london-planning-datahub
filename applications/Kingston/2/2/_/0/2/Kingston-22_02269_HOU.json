    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed two storey side extension would not result in the loss of the original cat-slide roof which is a distinct feature of properties along Kneller Road and the wider area and worthy of retention. The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of not being set down sufficiently from the existing roof line would appear as bulky and dominant addition. As such, the proposed development is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the street scene, contrary to Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 and 37 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013."
