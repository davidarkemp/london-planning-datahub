The proposed use would not be permitted under the provisions of Section 55(2)(f) the 1990 Act and therefore the use requires planning permission. Planning permission has not been granted by the Local Planning Authority or by The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\r\r"
