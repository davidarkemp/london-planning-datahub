  "decision_conditions": [
    "By reason of scale, mass and design, the proposed rear dormer roof extension, together with the hip-to-gable extension, would by virtue of its excessive size, siting and design create a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or cause material overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 42 Beverley Way. The proposed site plan demonstrates that the proposal could result in a detrimental impact to the amenities of the neighbour. As such, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
