    "Due to the siting, design and form of the uncharacteristic dormer extension proposed on the front roof slope, the proposed development would appear unduly prominent within the Gilders Road streetscene, and constitute an incongruous addition that would not relate well to the host property, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
