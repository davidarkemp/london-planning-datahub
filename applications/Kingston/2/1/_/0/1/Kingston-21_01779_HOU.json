    "The proposed external finishes would create an incongruous addition to the host property and would not sit comfortably with the existing external appearance of the property 'jarring' with the existing external appearance of the host property and that of the neighbouring properties at the rear and would detract from the overall  character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
