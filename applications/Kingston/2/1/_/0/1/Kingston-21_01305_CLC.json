    "Insufficient information / information that contradicts with other submitted information pursuant to other planing conditions, has been submitted to allow this condition to be discharged.\r\rThe applicant should resubmit following the GLA advice found at \r\rhttps://www.london.gov.uk/what-we-do/planning/implementing-london-plan/london-plan-guidance/urban-greening-factor-ugf-guidance\r\rPlease see details below\r\ra) Methodology - the calculations for the UGF are incorrect - the methodology provided by the GLA within the London Plan states that the calculation must be based on the site area (in this instance the application form describes the site area as 0.17ha) however the UGF Report prepared by Lizard have not used the site area, rather they have added up the areas that contribute to the UGF and used this to base their calculation. (0.108h) - this results in an inflated UGF as they have not accounted for the impermeable areas which score '0' (ie areas of building without green roofs and impermeable surfaces). This has resulted in an incorrect assessment of the UGF and should be corrected.\r\rb) The Landscape Plan (LLD2295-LAN-DWG-101) accompanying the UGF show permeable paving to the parking areas (Tegula Priora). This is in contrast to the Drainage Strategy which states that the parking area will be drained 'via trapped gullies' and that water storage will be 'tanked' - ie the Drainage Strategy does not include for any permeable paving. Furthermore, Planning Condition 30 requires ' The car parking shown on the approved plans shall be provided with a hard-bound, adequately drained,\rdust-free surface'.\r\rThe Landscape drawing refers to permeable paving for the paths but again, this has not been included on the RPS Drainage strategy plan. The two should be coordinated to ensure consistency and if permeable paths are to be used, this should be included as part of the drainage strategy.\r\rThe UGF Report by Lizard includes permeable paving within the calculation however this will need to be updated to reflect the actual surfaces that are to be used. We would also note that Lizard have classed paving slabs within the UGF as permeable, this is incorrect, and again not reflected within the Drainage Strategy."
