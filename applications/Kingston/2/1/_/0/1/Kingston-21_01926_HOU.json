    "Due to the excessive scale and depth of the side and part of the rear extension, combined with the proposed finishing materials, the proposed development would constitute an incongruous addition that would not relate well to the host property or the  surrounding area. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in harm to the Southborough Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Paragraphs 199 to 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the excessive depth of the proposed side extension, combined with its siting along inclose proximity to the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance, fail to preserve the outlook and result in an undue sense of enclosure to the occupants at No.51 Woodlands Road, resulting in unacceptable harm to neighbouring residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
