    "The proposed development would amount to development as defined by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) (engineering operation) and as such would require planning permission (Section 57 of the Act)\r\rSection 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act directs that\r\r(1)If any person wishes to ascertain whether—\r\r(a)any existing use of buildings or other land is lawful;\r(b)any operations which have been carried out in, on, over or under land are lawful; or\r(c)any other matter constituting a failure to comply with any condition or limitation subject to which planning permission has been granted is lawful,he may make an application for the purpose to the local planning authority specifying the land and describing the use, operations or other matter.\r\rSection 191 further directs \r\r(2)For the purposes of this Act uses and operations are lawful at any time if—\r(a)no enforcement action may then be taken in respect of them (whether because they did not involve development or require planning permission or because the time for enforcement action has expired or for any other reason); and\r(b)they do not constitute a contravention of any of the requirements of any enforcement notice then in force.\r\rThe installation of the generator is not permitted under The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. \r\rThe generator does not benefit from immunity through the passage of time.\r\rThe applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate on the balance of probabilities that the development is lawful.\r\rThe applicant is therefore advised to apply for planning permission for the proposed development."
