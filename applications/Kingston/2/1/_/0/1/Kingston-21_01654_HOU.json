    "The proposed development, by reason of the proposed flat roof form of the first floor outrigger, would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area and less than substantial harm to the significance of the Albert Road / Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
