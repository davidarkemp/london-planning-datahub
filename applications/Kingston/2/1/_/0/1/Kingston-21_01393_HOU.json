    "The proposed extension would create an undue sense of enclosure to the nearest ground floor habitable room window at No. 87 Northcote Road and unacceptably limit its outlook, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. As such the proposed development would conflict with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
