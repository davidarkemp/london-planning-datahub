The scheme shall be sufficient to provide all habitable rooms with background and purge ventilation with air taken from the rear of the building (the north facade) so as to negate the need for occupiers to open windows, as per the recommendations of the air quality assessment. \r\rReason: In the interests of air quality, in accordance with policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Prior to any above ground level works, a scheme of noise insulation/reduction shall be submitted to ensure that the noise level of 35 dBLAeq,16 hour  in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBLAeq,8 hour  and 45 dBLAmax during the night time (measured with F time-weighting and between 2300 and 0700 hours) in bedrooms in accordance with BS8233:2014 shall not be exceeded.  Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated.  The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised.\r\rThe approved mitigation measures shall be implemented prior to beneficial occupation of the development and be permanently retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for the occupants of the development, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",

The boilers shall have dry NOx emissions not exceeding 40 mg/kWh.

The scheme shall be designed to be 5dB better than that given in Approved Document E (2003 Edition incorporating 2004 and 2010 amendments) of the Building Regulations (Table 0.1a, page 12). Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for future occupants of the development and neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
