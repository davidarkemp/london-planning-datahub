    "Condition 3 of 20/00702/FUL is amended to read as follows:\r\rNo internal alterations shall be carried out until details demonstrating that at least 10% of the new units forming part of this development (a minimum of 1 unit) will be designed to be built to standards for accessible and adaptable dwelling shall have been submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.
