    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), a final detailed drainage design, including drawings, supporting calculations, SuDS Statement and Drainage Assessment Form shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components must also be submitted to demonstrate how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The system shall be implemented and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r \rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021, the Sustainable Design and Construction SPG 2014, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems 2015 and policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary, or incidental, or both, to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '243 Tudor Drive, KT2 5PF', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form, and shall not be used for sleeping accommodation, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation/sleeping accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in terms of residential amenity, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The garage hereby approved shall not be fitted with a door that opens over the rear access lane, a roller garage door or other such similar door shall be installed and permanently retained. \r\rReason: In the interests of highway safety of those using the rear access lane in accordance with policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
