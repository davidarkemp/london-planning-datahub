    "The proposed rear extension at first floor level would conflict with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of its siting and depth would represent an unsatisfactory form of development, and one that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the surrounding area. The development would also set a precedent for  development that is uncharacteristics of the built form opf surrounding properties and Liverpool Road Conservation Area, contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Due to the excessive depth and siting of the proposed first floor rear extension (above the proposed ground floor extension), the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring property. In particular, No. 5 Liverpool Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
