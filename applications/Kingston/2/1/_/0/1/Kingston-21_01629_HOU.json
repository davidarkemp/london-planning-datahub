    "By reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No.25 Bowness Crescent the proposed first floor side extension would appear a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, erode the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties on Bowness Crescent and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
