    "The proposed development, by reason of the roof form of the two storey extension, would appear as an incongruous feature in the Willow Road street scene, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the single storey extension, would appear overbearing when viewed from 32 Willow Road and would unduly deprive the occupants of this property of natural light, resulting in material harm to their living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
