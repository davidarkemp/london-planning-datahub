The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale and siting, would appear overbearing when viewed from Nos. 9 and 13 Cotsford Avenue and would deprive these properties of natural light, resulting in material harm to the living conditions of their occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant, in failing to provide any details of the amendments to the vehicular access to the site, has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, through the provision of an excessive number of on-site car parking spaces, would fail to adequately promote sustainable transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM8 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the health and longevity of trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
