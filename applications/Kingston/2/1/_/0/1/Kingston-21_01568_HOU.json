    "The cumulative impact of the the proposed front porch, ground and first floor level extensions and roof extensions, front and rear dormers, loss of front garden/soft landscaping and additional parking in the front garden would represent an overdevelopment of the application property, and one that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the streetscene or surrounding area. The development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the area and result in less than substantial harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Area Strategic Area of Special Character, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy H1 of the London Plan 2020 and Policies CS8, D3, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed loss of on-street car parking spaces would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, T4 of the London Plan, 2021 and policies and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012."
