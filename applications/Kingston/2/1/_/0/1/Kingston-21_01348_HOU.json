    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, form and siting of the proposed extensions, would unduly erode the gap to No.  28 Bearfield Road and would appear as an incongruous feature within the Bearfield Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r"
