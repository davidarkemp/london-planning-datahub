    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development is making the most efficient or effective use of this brownfield site, contrary to paragraph 119 of the NPPF and Policy H1 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and consistent evidence or robust justification that the site is not suitable or that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the existing public house use or a range of alternative employment uses. The proposed development is therefore contrary to  Policy E1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS11 and DM 17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and consistent evidence or robust justification that the public house is no longer needed, that it has been vacant and marketed for a community use without success, or it can be re-provided elsewhere or in a different way. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies HC5, HC6 and HC7 of the London Plan (2021), the Mayor's Culture & the Night-Time Economy SPG and Policy DM 24 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The introduction of a first floor bedroom window (rearmost) on the western flank of the building, separated from habitable room windows to No's 1 and 2 Kestrel Lodge by approximately 11.5m, is considered to result in unacceptable levels of overlooking and an undue loss of privacy to the occupiers of these neighbouring properties, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "In the absence of information to demonstrate that the proposed dwelling would benefit from adequate levels of privacy, daylight and sunlight (to the ground floor dining room) and would be provided with private, usable and safe amenity space (given the existence of an external staircase serving the existing first floor flat), or that the units would achieve the required minimum floor to ceiling height, the proposal would provide a poor standard of accommodation, in conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "No mechanism has been secured to preclude residents from applying for on-street car parking permits in the Controlled Parking Zone, therefore it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not lead to inconsiderate parking and traffic congestion in surrounding roads and thereby have an unacceptable impact upon highway or pedestrian or highway safety, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a flood risk assessment for the site, it has not been demonstrated that the flood risk to the site has been adequately addressed and managed to ensure that future users of the development would not be placed in danger from flood hazards throughout the lifetime of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 166 of the NPPF (2021), Policy SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and DM4 of the Core Strategy (2012)."
