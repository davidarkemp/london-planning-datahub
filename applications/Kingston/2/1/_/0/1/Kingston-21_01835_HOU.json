    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the proposed extension, would unduly erode the gap to No.  6 Beechcroft Road and would appear as an incongruous feature within the Beechcroft Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the excessive depth of the proposed extension, combined with its siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to the occupants at No.6 Beechcroft Road, resulting in unacceptable harm to neighbouring residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
