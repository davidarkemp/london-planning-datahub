    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the proposed extension, would unduly erode the gap to No.  13 Liverpool Road, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and as such would fail to preserve the character of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area, resulting in less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposal therefore conflicts with Paragraphs 199 to 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The depth of the proposed extension, combined with its siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 13 Liverpool Road, resulting in unacceptable harm to neighbouring residential amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
