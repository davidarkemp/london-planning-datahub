    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is located on the eastern side of Clarence Street and is a property currently in use as a nightclub, restaurant and cinema complex. The primary structure of the property on the right-hand side comprises a Grade II Listed Building (list entry no. 1358456) which was originally constructed in 1939 as the Granada Cinema, designed by George Coles with interior design by Komisarjevsky. A newer structure is attached to the original 1939 building on the left-hand side and therefore, attracts the same Listed Building status albeit a later addition with extensive remodelling. \r\rPublic Consultation - No response received \r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity\rClarence Street has contrasting styles of signage and methods of illumination. The applicant confirmed that the proposed signage letters will be metal which is considered acceptable. It is considered that the proposed illuminated signage and printed letters and logo would be of a sympathetic addition to and proportionate to the existing host property and would not detract from its character and appearance and the surrounding area. It is considered that the proposed signage would be subservient to the host property and that of the other signage on Clarence Street. \r\rThe proposed illuminance levels of 197cd/sqm of the proposed signage is considered to be acceptable and would not result in any harmful light pollution.\r\rGiven the modest scale, appropriate design and location, the proposed elements would not cause harm to the listed building as a designated heritage asset.\r\rOverall the proposal would not cause harm to the surrounding area and the statutorily listed building.\r\rPublic safety\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would accord with policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r\r",
