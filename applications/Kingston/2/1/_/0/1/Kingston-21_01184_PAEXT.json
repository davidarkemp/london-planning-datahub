    "The proposed extension would result in an adverse impact on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers at No. 14 Princes Avenue by way of loss of daylight. The proposal would be contrary to policy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling located within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing rear garage and erection of a single storey  office cabin.\r\rConsultations\r22 properties were notified of the proposal. \rTwo representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rOfficer comment: the above concerns will be addressed with this report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed footprint of the outbuilding is considered to be in-keeping with the similar outbuilding in the surrounding area. However, the proposed height of approximately 4.3m is considered to be excessive and not appropriate for an outbuilding. \r\rAs such, the proposal would appear more as a separate dwelling rather than a subordinate outbuilding to the host dwelling. It would comprise a dominant and intrusive structure that would adversely affect the character and appearance of the area. \r\rWith regards to the proposed use of the outbuilding as an office/store room, a relevant condition would be added to ensure ancillary use of the proposal in the event of approval.\r\rThe applicant should note that change of use of the outbuilding to an independent unit of accommodation would require separate planning permission.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 202 to 206 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 216 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character, which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an adverse impact to the host property would not relate well to the host property and have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  result in harm to the significance of Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the concerns received within the written representations. \r\rThe proposed excessive height of the building is considered to be unneighbourly. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposal and the existing outbuildings at the adjoining properties, the proposal is not considered to result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties.\r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential outbuilding to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement, however no appropriate passive and active fire safety measures have been proposed. Further details would be secured via a relevant condition in the event of approval.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
