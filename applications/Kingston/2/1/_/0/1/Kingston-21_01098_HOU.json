    "Due to the lack of side elevation drawings and inaccurate drawings of the openings at adjoining property No. 4 Forest Side, it has not been possible to assess the impacts of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, particularly with respect to daylight. Furthermore, the proposed extension by reason of its height and depth would appear overbearing for the occupiers of the adjoining semi-detached dwelling.  The proposal would not comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \r"
