All details shall be in accordance with British Standard BS5837: 2012 \"Trees in relation to Design, Demolition and Construction\"\r\rThe approved protection scheme shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work in relation to the outbuilding, and be maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development or until such stage as detailed within the approved AMS.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor or above in the side elevations of the extension hereby approved unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
