    "The applicant has failed to provide evidence to demonstrate that the provision of 3 bedroom or more (family sized) units would be  unviable or that the application site unsuitable for such units.  As such the proposal does not accord with policy DM13 of the Royal Borough of Kingston Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed rear extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would constitute an incongruous addition to the host property. They would not be a subordinate addition and would be of an excessive mass and bulk disproportionate to the existing built form of the application plot and would form a dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive feature in the private views of the site from neighbouring properties and would detract from the host property and the surrounding areas character and appearance. The proposal in this respect would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate by way of a sun path analysis or daylight/sunlight report that the proposed development would not harm the amenities of the occupants of neighbouring land and buildings by way of reducing daylight/sunlight to unacceptable levels, as such the development would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not lead to increased on-street parking pressure and vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 \r"
