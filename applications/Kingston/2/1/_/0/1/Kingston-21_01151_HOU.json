    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, form, siting and design of the extensions, would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of St Andrews Square Conservation Area and St Andrews Church, which would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the scheme. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 196 of the NPPF 2019, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the upper ground floor extension, would unduly enclose No. 11 St Andrews Road and unduly deprive it of natural light, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
