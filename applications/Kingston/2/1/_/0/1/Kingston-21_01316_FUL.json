    "The proposed development a hot food take-away would be within 400 mteres of Richard Challenor RC Secondary Scholl and  Malden Manor Primary and Nursery School. As such the proposed development would be in conflict with London Plan Policy Policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) that states development proposals containing A5 hot food takeaway uses should not be permitted where these are within 400 metres walking distance from the entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide an accoustic report or details of the extract system and the control of smells and odours and as such the LPA is unable to determine whether or not the proposed development would cause harm to the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers by way of noise pollution or odours and smells. As such the proposal would fail to accord with policy DM 10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy APril 2012",
    "The proposed extraction system would be of a size, siting and design that would create an incongruous feature at the rear of the proprety and be visually intrusive in the views of the rear of the site creating visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host poperty and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
