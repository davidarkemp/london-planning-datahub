    "The proposed residential unit would offer poor outlook for the future occupants and would not be conducive to a good standard of living accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS8 and DM13 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed residential unit is not provided with any external amenity space for the proposed residential unit, which is contrary to Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed flatted accommodation would meet the internal space standards set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents with particular regard to floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021."
