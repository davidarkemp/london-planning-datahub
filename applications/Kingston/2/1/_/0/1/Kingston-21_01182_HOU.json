    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, size, design and massing would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene and would represent a cramped form of development which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area.  The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, design and massing would sit uncomfortably along the junction of Ladywood Road and Hamilton Avenue and would detract from the open setting of the corner plot and would represent an incongruous form of development within the street scene of Ladywood Road, which includes a strong building line and pattern of development. In addition, the proposed development would set a precedent for similar development within the area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
