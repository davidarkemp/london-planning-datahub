    "As the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would pass the 45-degree test in relation to the closest habitable windows at No. 71 Queens Drive, officers consider that the proposed development would unduly compromise the amenities of No. 71 Queens Drive by reason of loss of light/sunlight. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
