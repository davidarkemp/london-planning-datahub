    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension would have a contrived and discordant appearance while the dormer would not accord with PG39 of the Residential Design SPD (2013). The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the Claremont Road Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013), Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and the NPPF (2019).",
