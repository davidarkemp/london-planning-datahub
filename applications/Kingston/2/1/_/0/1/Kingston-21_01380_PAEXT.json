    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height and proximity to the shared boundary with No. 115 Southwood Drive, would appear overbearing when viewed from No. 115 Southwood Drive and would result in an undue sense of enclosure, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of this property. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 127 of the NPPF, policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
