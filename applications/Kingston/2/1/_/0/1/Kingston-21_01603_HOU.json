    "The proposed combination of the scale and siting of the proposed side extension at ground floor level would represent an overdevelopment of the application property, and a development that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the streetscene or surrounding area and would therefore fail to preserve the character and appearance of the area. The extension would also set a precedent for development that is uncharacteristic of the built form of surrounding properties, contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed ground floor side extension by virtue of its combined siting, scale and lack of detail, would create an incongruous and visually bulky addition that would detract from the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host property. In particular, when viewed from the neighbouring property at 110 Surbiton Hill Park. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019)."
