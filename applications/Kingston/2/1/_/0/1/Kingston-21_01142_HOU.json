    "The proposed development by virtue of its excessive scale, bulk, form, height and design would result in an incongruous addition to the rear elevation which would not be in keeping with the host property or the surrounding area, resulting in a jarring feature in the streetscape. The proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS8 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in a materially harmful impact to the amenities afforded to each adjoining neighbouring residential dwelling in terms of loss of light, overshadowing visual dominance and sense of overbearing. The proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS8 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
