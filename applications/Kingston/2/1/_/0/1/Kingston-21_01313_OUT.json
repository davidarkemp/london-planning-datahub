    "By reason of the development's siting, footprint, combined height, width and depth and poorly resolved and repetitive design, the proposal is considered to result in a building of excessive scale and mass and a plot density that is wholly out of keeping with the pattern of development in the surrounding area which fails to address the site context, resulting in harm to the local townscape, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "By reason of the development's siting, footprint, combined height, width and depth and poorly resolved and repetitive design, the proposal is considered to result in a building of excessive scale and mass and a plot density that is wholly out of keeping with the pattern of development in the surrounding area and fails to address the site context, resulting in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Claremont Road Conservation Area, in conflict with paragraphs 199-202 of the NPPF (2021), D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "By reason of the siting of the proposed building in close proximity to the southern boundary with the neighbouring commercial timber yard, and the introduction of 19 predominantly single aspect bedrooms directly facing the neighbouring site, the proposal is considered to provide a poor standard of internal living accommodation, impacted by the operations of the existing business in terms of poor air quality and noise conditions. Also, by reason of the enclosed nature, aspect and siting of the rear garden amenity space, the proposal is considered to be served by inadequate communal amenity space. The proposal is therefore in conflict with policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of the siting of the proposed building in close proximity to the southern boundary with the neighbouring commercial timber yard, and the introduction of 19 predominantly single aspect bedrooms directly facing the neighbouring site, and the absence of information to demonstrate that the amenities of future occupiers of the development can be adequately safeguarded without the need for future restrictions on the operations of the neighbouring timber yard, in relation to noise and air quality, the application is considered to be in conflict with the 'agent of change' principles set out in paragraph 187 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of sufficient information to demonstrate why BREEAM 'Outstanding' and the London Plan 'Be Lean' 15% target cannot be achieved, and in the absence of a s106 legal agreement securing the necessary carbon offset payments, the proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it would achieve the highest standards of sustainable design and construction to mitigate the likely effects of climate change and is thus contrary to Policy SI 2 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM1 and DM3 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Planning Obligations SPD (2017).",
    "In the absence of a s106 legal agreement restricting business parking permits, securing disabled parking provision and a s278 agreement securing the construction of the new vehicular access, the proposed development has failed to demonstrate that it can effectively mitigate the transport and highways impact of the development and avoid an unacceptable impact on highway safety or a severe impact on the local road network, in conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), policies DM8 and DM9 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Planning Obligations SPD (2017)."
