    "The proposed raised roof ridge height would disrupt the symmetry with adjoining No. 20 Meadowbank and would appear incongruous which would cause harm to the character and appearance of the existing building, pair of semi-detached dwellings and the wider area. The proposed dormer would fail to complement the character of the existing house or the wider area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD (2013), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
