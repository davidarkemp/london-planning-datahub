    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, form, height and siting of the proposed garage, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Sylvan Gardens street scene, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the Southborough Conservation Area, which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of proper vehicular access to the proposed garage, would endanger other highway users. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the provision of an excessive number of car parking spaces, would fail to adequately promote sustainable modes of transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not harm the health or longevity of trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
