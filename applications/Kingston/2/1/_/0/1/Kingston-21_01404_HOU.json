  "epc_number": null,

  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed raised roof ridge height would disrupt the symmetry with adjoining property, No. 19 Meadowbank and would appear incongruous which would cause harm to the character and appearance of the existing building, the pair of semi-detached dwellings the application site forms part of and the wider area. The proposed dormer would fail to complement the character of the existing house and the wider area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed dormer, along with the increased massing associated with the increased roof height would appear overbearing to Nos. 8 and 10 King Charles Road contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
