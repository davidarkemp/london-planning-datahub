    "Due to the height, design, proximity to the shared boundary and integration with the bay windows on the front elevation the proposed extension would appear excessive and cramped and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
