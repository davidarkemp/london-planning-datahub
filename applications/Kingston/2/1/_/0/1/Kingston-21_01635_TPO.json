    "The tree is showing no signs of ill health, has not grown substantially in a number of years and while growing with a heavy lean, the amount of canopy is not so excessive to require drastic reduction works. The tree is also in a sheltered position and not unduly subjected to strong winds, it is healthy and its shape is quite usual for the species. As the canopy is fairly small for a Pine, the amount's proposed for removal are significant and unwarranted.\r\rThis was a Conservation Area Notification but has changed to a TPO works application as the Council have served a TPO within the 6 week time frame in order to prevent the works as provided for in law."
