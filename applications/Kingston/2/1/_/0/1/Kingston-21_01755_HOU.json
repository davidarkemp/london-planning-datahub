    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed height and siting of the built form would relate well to the established building lines and roof heights on Kent Way. As such the proposed development would result in harm to the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area and would be contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would accord with the 25 degree rule as required by Policy Guidance 18 of the Residential Design SPD and would not create an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of Nos. 92 and 94 Kent Way in terms of overbearing appearance, overshadowing and loss of light/sunlight to their ground floor habitable windows. As such the proposed development would result in harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers and would be contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r",
