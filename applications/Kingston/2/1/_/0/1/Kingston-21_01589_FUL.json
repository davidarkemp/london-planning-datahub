    "Due to the height, design and siting of the raised platform and associated screening, the outbuilding is considered to be prominent and incongruous feature that does not relate well to either the host dwelling or the immediate surrounding area. Furthermore, it is considered to result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Park Road Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposed development would conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "Due to the height, design and siting of the raised platform and associated screening, the outbuilding is considered to have an unacceptable impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of overbearing impact, visual intrusion and loss of privacy, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
