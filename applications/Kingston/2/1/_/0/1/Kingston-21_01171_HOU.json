    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, form and siting, would upset the visual balance with No. 24 Burlington Road and would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Walton Avenue street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy."
