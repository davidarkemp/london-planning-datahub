    "The proposed dormer and rooflights are considered to fall within the parameters of Classes B and C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would be lawful.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Variation of Condition Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans), Condition 10 (Tree Protection Plan), Condition 11 (Privacy Screens), Condition 15 (Waste and Recycle) and Condition 16 (Cycle Parking) of planning permission 21/00012/FUL (Erection of detached two-storey single family dwellinghouse with basement and accommodation in roofspace (following demolition of existing dwelling)) to remove basement, balcony to second floor, light wells and enlarge rear extension. Removal of Condition 10, Condition 11, Condition 15, Condition 16.'",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of single storey side storage. Erection of part two storey/part single storey rear extension, two storey side extension, two storey front bay window and front canopy porch. Erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and 2 objections from one address have been received stating;\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Loss of symmetry\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 36 (Two Storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) states that two storey and first floor side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. In practice this means the extension should remain subordinate to the original house and care should be taken to retain characteristic gaps between houses to prevent them from combining visually to form a terrace and balconies will generally not be acceptable, particularly where they may give rise to overlooking. Furthermore, on semi-detached properties, the extension should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property, should not exceed 50% the width of the original house, should be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps.\rThe roof line should be set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm and front elevation should be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house.\r\rThe proposed development would not comply with the guidance as it has not been set down or back, would further upset the symmetry of the semi detached properties, would include the introduction of a balcony at first floor level and would not appear as a subordinate addition to the original house but would result in discordant and jumbled appearance\r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would be built hard up against the boundary with No. 102 Bodley road which has not been extended to the rear. Due to its depth and height the proposed development would be overbearing and unneighbourly. With regards to the proposed balcony, such development would not be acceptable within such a suburban area due to introduction of noise intrusion and loss of privacy and the perception of being overlooked. It is noted that screening was provided for one side but this would not eliminate the all of the issues raised. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
