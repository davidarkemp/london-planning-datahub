    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any above-ground works, a detailed landscape & planting plan shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe plan shall include, where appropriate, a clear key or legend corresponding to the landscaping plan and providing the following information:\r\r- Replanting of lost trees on a ratio of 2 trees planted for each tree lost\r- Species (both Latin & Common names) for all plants\r- Locations of all plants or areas of planting\r- Plant numbers or planting densities\r- Sizes of all plants and particularly trees 'at time of planting'\r- Details of all hard-landscaping areas including materials \r\rThe approved scheme shall then be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development.
