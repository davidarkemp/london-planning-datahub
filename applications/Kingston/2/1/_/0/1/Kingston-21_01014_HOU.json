    "The outbuilding by reason of its siting, size and use is not considered to represent an ancillary use to the host building and is capapable of being used as a separate dwelling, independent to 21 Cromwell Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to     policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. and SPD Policy 41.",
    "By reason of its scale, design and proximity to the rear boundary the proposed outbuilding is considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenity of neighbouring properties at No.s 1 & 2 Haddon Close in terms of overbearing impact, and loss of privacy. The proposal is therefore thereby contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
