    "The proposed development would fall within the limitations of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would be lawful.",
    "No representations have been received.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r18 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear would have a total depth of approximately 2.3m and a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.3m with an eave height of approximately 2.5m, falling in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, the extension would not be visible in the streetscene, would still appear subordinate to the host dwelling and would not be an incongruous addition in the immediate vicinity.\r\rThe changes to fenestration would respect the host dwelling existing fenestration and would not cause signficant harm to the wider area.\r\rOverall, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities, it is noted that the extension would not breach the BRE test regarding No. 7 and No.9 Mayfair Close.\r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which is considered to be sufficient for the purposes of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
