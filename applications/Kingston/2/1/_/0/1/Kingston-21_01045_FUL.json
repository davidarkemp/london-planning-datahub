    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r",
    "The additional car parking spaces hereby approved shall have a permeable surface in accordance with the Surface Water Drainage Strategy for Additional Proposed Car Parking Spaces, Rev P04 dated 07.06.2021 and Report No. 11072-CNM-XX-XX-RP-D-1001, Rev P2,  Permeable Paving Water Quality Treatment, September 2021, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The permeable paving shall thereafter be retained in perpetuity.\r\rReason: To ensure sufficient surface water drainage in accordance with Policies SI12 and SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM4 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The additional car parking shall be provided in accordance with drawing ref: 'PMA Layout v20c - Proposed Car Parking Spaces (Post Demolition of Ex-Catering Block)' and shall thereafter be retained in perpetuity, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure that sufficient on-site car parking is provided and thereafter retained for the approved uses in accordance with Policies DM8 DM9 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Within 6 months of the date of this decision notice, the 58 car parking spaces on the site of the former Command Centre, as shown on PMA Layout v20c - Proposed Car Parking Spaces (Post Demolition of Ex-Catering Block), shall be provided and made available for their intended use, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure that sufficient on-site car parking is provided following the loss of the car parking on the Regents Wing disposal site and to minimise overspill car parking on the public highway, in accordance with Policies DM8 and DM9 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Within 6 months of the date of this decision notice, a detailed tree planting/replanting and landscaping scheme shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The submitted scheme shall be based upon drawing ref: 'PMA Layout v19c overlaid with KHFT tree planting strategy', and shall include species type and size. The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for a period of five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. \r\rAny trees or shrubs which die, are removed or become diseased during this period shall be replaced during the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose. Alterations to the landscaping scheme must be agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development and to ensure sufficient replacement tree planting and landscaping, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Prior to commencement of any development associated with the additional car parking hereby approved (including any works of demolition), a detailed arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.  This submission shall include:\r \r1. A plan to a scale and level of accuracy appropriate to the proposal, that shows the positions, crown spreads and root protection areas (RPA) of every retained tree on site, and on nearby ground or land adjacent to the site, in relation to the approved plans.\r2. A schedule of pre-construction works for the above-detailed trees, where appropriate.\r3. Calculated dimensions and positions of all tree root protection areas.\r4. Details and positions of tree protection barriers and ground protection where appropriate.\r5. Details and positions of any construction exclusion zones.\r6. Details and positions of the existing and proposed underground service runs, to be routed to avoid root protection areas where possible and if not possible, for alternative methods of installation to be detailed within the AMS.\r7. Details and positions of any change in levels or positions of any excavations within 5m of the root protection area of retained trees.\r8. Details of any special engineering required to accommodate proposals within the root protection areas of retained trees (e.g. in connection with foundations, service installation, bridging, water features, surfacing).\r9. Details of the working methods to be employed for the installation of drives, paths or any other form of hard surfacing within the root protection areas of retained trees in accordance with the principles of 'No Dig' construction. All details shall be in accordance with British Standard BS5837: 2012 \"Trees in relation to Design, Demolition and Construction\"\r \rThe approved protection scheme shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site associated with the additional car parking spaces hereby approved, including demolition, and be maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development or until such stage as detailed within the approved AMS.\r \rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)\r \rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective\r"
