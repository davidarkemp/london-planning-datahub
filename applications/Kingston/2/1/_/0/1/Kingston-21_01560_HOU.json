    "The proposed combination, scale and siting of the proposed extensions at ground, first floor and second floor levels would represent an overdevelopment of the application property, and a development that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the streetscene or surrounding area and would therefore fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.  The additions and alterations at first floor level to the side and rear of the application property, in particular, would also set a precedent for development that is uncharacteristic of the built form of surrounding properties and the Southborough Conservation Area, contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "The proposed first floor side extension by virtue of its combined siting, scale and lack of detail to the front elevation, would create an incongruous and visuall bulky addition to the host property that would detract from the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding Conseervation Area. In particular, when viewed from the neighbouring property at 45 Langley Avenue. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019)."
