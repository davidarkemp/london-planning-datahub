    "The proposed extension does not fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as it would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse.",
    "The proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of light to neighbouring property, No. 26 Vincent Avenue, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012. Furthermore, it would fail the 45 degree rule on both plan and elevation, conflicting with BRE Guidance.",
    "Please provide 'Time Stamp Photo'. It is a validation requirement \rPhotographs should show all sides of the application property, plus front and rear street scene photos showing the application property and the neighbouring properties. Photographs should have been taken within 3 months of the date of the submission of the application. Photographs should be clearly labelled.\r",
