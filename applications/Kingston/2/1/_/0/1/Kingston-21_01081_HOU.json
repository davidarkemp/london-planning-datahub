    "The proposed single storey rear element of the proposed extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of its excessive depth beyond the rear elevation and would fail to be a proportionate addition to the existing dwelling which would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The excessive depth and height of the single storey rear element of the proposed extension along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 44 Warren Drive North.  It would also be at odds with the suburban character of the area and would conflict with current BRE guidance in relation to loss of daylight/sunlight. The proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of adjoining No. 44 Warren Drive, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The sumbitted Floor Plans  and Elevations are not drawn to scale. For example the scale bars and annotated dimensions do not measure to the stated scale. Extracts are shown below. Please check and amend the plans as they must be measurable and to scale.",
    "All applications that involve extensions must provide \"45 Degree\" floor and elevation plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the 45 degree 'rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r"
