    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed development would therefore exceed the limitations of Class A (in particular A.1(J)(iii)) of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would not be lawful.",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Side Elevations of the dwelling at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing full elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. A scale bar is encouraged.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings."
