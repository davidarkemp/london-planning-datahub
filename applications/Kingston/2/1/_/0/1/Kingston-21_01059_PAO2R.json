    "Scale Bar Issues - the scale bars on the Site Location Plan, Block Plan and Site Plans do not measure to the stated scale. Extracts are shown below. You will need to submit the original PDF plans purchased. Please refer to the Validation Local List (pages 10-13) for requirements for each of these plans. (https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/file/2737/validation-local-list)",
    "Site Location plan red line - please amend the red line to include land necessary to carry out the proposed development, i.e. land required for access to the site from a public highway. \rNote: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red and any other land owned by the applicant in blue. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, car parking and open areas around buildings).\r",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations and indicating all key dimensions. A scale bar is encouraged.\rWe require all elevations. You can label these as \"Existing Elevations (no change proposed)\"",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Floor Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. A scale bar is encouraged.\rThe Existing Floor Plan area would be labelled e.g. as \"residential outbuilding\", and the Proposed Floor Plan area would be labelled e.g. as \"Business space\"",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Roof Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions of the proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. A scale bar is highly encouraged.\rYou can label this as \"Existing Roof Plan (no change proposed)\"",
    "Validation Checklist Update - Once you have provided any additional documents please update the Validation Checklist document to confirm that they have been provided by stating \"Yes\" where relevant.
