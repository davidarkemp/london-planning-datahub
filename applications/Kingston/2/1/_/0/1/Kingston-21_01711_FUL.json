    "The proposed dwelling would not provide satisfactory living conditions for current and/or future occupiers of the units of accommodation due to a failure to meet the minimum internal space standards set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021) as well as a failure to provide any private amenity space. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. This would carry significant weight against the proposal.",
    "The proposal would also fail to provide any secure cycle parking on site and would fail to promote sustainable modes of transport  The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and  policies DM8 and DM9 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012). This would carry moderate weight against the proposal.",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of any cogent or robust evidence that the proposed development would not increase on-street car parking stress which could result in inconsiderate on-street car parking, which would, in turn, compromise highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies T4 and T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. This would carry significant weight against the proposal.",
    "The proposal would fail to provide any waste or recycling storage facilities within the application site boundary and it is unclear where these could be accommodated within the site. Consequently the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would ensure proper waste management. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
