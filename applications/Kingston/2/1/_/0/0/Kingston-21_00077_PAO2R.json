Dusk 'til dawn  lighting is preferred to the appropriate lumens. \r- External bicycle parking facilities will be designed for secure storage using bicycle lockers, hangers or dedicated storage devices. This is the preferred option for cycle storage as they are tested and secure. They are to be certificated to one of the following minimum standards, or above (listed here alphanumerically): \r- LPS 1175 Issue 7 Security Rating 2, or LPS 1175 Issue 8 Security Rating B3, or LPS 2081 Issue 1 Security Rating B, or Sold Secure SS104 Silver, or STS 205 Issue 7 Burglar Resistance BR2, or STS 225 Issue 2 Burglar Resistance BR2(S), or 88 STS 501 Security Rating TR2, or STS 503 Security Rating TR2 64.2 \r\rSheds used for bicycle parking 64.4 Where family bicycle parking is provided in a robust garden shed, the minimum requirements for the shed construction and security are as follows: \r-38x50mm (minimum) planed timber frame Floor and roof constructed from 11mm boards (minimum) \r- 11x125mm (minimum) tongue and grooved board walls and door\r- No window to be present Door hinges should be coach-bolted through the shed structure or secured with security or non-return screws \r- Two hasp and staples certificated to Sold Secure SS303 Bronze (minimum), should  be used. One positioned 200mm - 300mm down from the top of the door and one positioned 200mm - 300mm up from the bottom of the door. \r- Additionally, hasp and staples should be coach bolted through the shed structure or secured with either security or no return screws \r- Both padlocks should be certificated to either LPS 2081 Security Rating 1 or Sold Secure SS303 Bronze (minimum) Shall be securely fixed to a suitable substrate foundation \r- Bicycles and other property that are to be stored within the shed should have a \rsecurity ground anchor system, wall mounted shed shackle or bicycle stand and shall also meet the minimum requirements within paragraph \r- All products should be securely fixed to suitable foundations in accordance with the manufacturer's specifications\r\rI would also like to take this opportunity to remind the applicant that they are solely responsible for any risk for noncompliance any standards that have been required at the time of the build by Secured by Design. \r\rSecured by Design (SbD) is an initiative that works to improve the security of buildings and their immediate surroundings to provide safe places to live, work, shop and visit. SbD is the Police Preferred Specification and provides a recognised standard for all security products that can deter and reduce crime. \r\rSbD has produced a series of Design Guides to assist the building, design and construction industry to incorporate security into developments. It is therefore recommended that the applicant consider the appropriate best practice design guidance and approved tested products which can be found at the Secure by Design website www.securedbydesign.com."
