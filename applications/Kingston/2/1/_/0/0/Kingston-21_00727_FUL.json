    "Archaeology advice: It is recommended that the archaeological interest can be progressed by a two-stage approach. \rFirst stage would be the machine stripping of the topsoil, possibly in spits from the areas of the proposed ground impacts to permit any potential archaeology to be observed and then investigated. \r-\tSecond stage would be the machine stripping of the remaining deposits to depth, again in spits with both stages being undertaken with pro-active archaeological engagement.\rIt would also be helpful for the anticipated Written Scheme Investigation to include an understanding of the scope there is to modify the design and layout of the scheme should significant remains be present, and how the works will be carried out to avoid incidental damage (e.g. by machine rutting) for which a method statement may be needed. Mark Stevenson (GLAAS)  has advised that he would be happy to maeet and  discuss the mitigation approach with the applicant and their archaeology consultant if this would be helpful.\rA suitable working method with contingency arrangements for significant discoveries will need to be agreed. The outcome will be a report and archive.\r\rYou can find more information on archaeology and planning in Greater London on  GLAAS website.\rThis response relates solely to archaeological considerations. If necessary, Historic England's Development Advice Team should be consulted separately regarding statutory matters.\r",
