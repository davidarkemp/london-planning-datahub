    "The proposed development is contrary to condition 8 of planning permission 15/14554/FUL. It is therefore not permitted by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed car parking space would be situated on land forward of a wall fronting a highway and forming a side elevation of the existing building. Therefore, the proposed development does not comply with limitations set out at Paragraph A.1(n)(iii) of Class A of Part 20 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of off-street car parking spaces, would lead to inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets which would, in turn, have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its unusual height in comparison to its width, would be poorly proportioned and would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the street scene, resulting in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Paragraphs 127 and 130 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, height, bulk and siting, would appear overbearing when viewed from Nos. 2, 3 and 4 Emerson Mews and No. 49 Montem Road and would unduly deprive the occupants of these properties of privacy. For the same reasons, it would also unduly deprive the occupants of 49 Emerson Mews of natural light. The proposed development would therefore result in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of Nos. 2, 3 and 4 Emerson Mews and No. 49 Montem Road, and is contrary to Paragraph 127 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "Condition 34 (Wind Mitigation) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of development (other than demolition and site enabling works) in any Phase or Development Plot (Other than Phase 1), details of mitigation for wind, including roof top enclosures, to be submitted for approval in writing by the Local Planning Authority for that phase. The scheme approved by the Local Planning Authority shall be fully implemented and maintained. \r\rReason: To achieve an acceptable wind climate within the public realm.\r\rOfficers response: The submitted information is considered to be sufficient. As such, the details submitted for Condition  34 (Wind Mitigation) in relation to Plot C, Phase 1 are hereby approved.",
    "All applications that involve extensions must provide \"45 Degree\" floor and elevation plans - this includes ground floor extensions. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the 45 degree 'rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r",
    "The Householder Validation Local List requires a completed Biodiversity Checklist for all applications. Please download and complete a copy of the Biodiversity Checklist from: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\rThe Householder Checklist states this was included, but was omitted from the submission documents.\r",
    "Please submit a Planning Fire Safety Strategy. The PFSS should address all aspects of part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021 and should include a statement of competence. It should also reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), and where applicable, a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) should be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\rThe Householder Checklist states this was included, but was omitted from the submission documents.",
    "This application has been submitted in pursuant to condition 6 of planning permission which states: \r\rPrior to the commencement of use hereby permitted, the applicant shall provide a scheme to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval detailing sound transmission reduction measures to be installed between the ground floor commercial uses and the first floor flats. The scheme shall be designed to be 5dB better than that given in Approved Document E (2003 Edition\rincorporating 2004 and 2010 amendments) of the Building Regulations (Table 0.1a, page 12). The scheme shall also include a management plan to control noise from group activities and weight lifting equipment. Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\rTo protect the amenity of the future occupants from noise ingress from the commercial activities in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)\r\rthe Borough Environmental Officer has reviewed the submitted materials and recommends approval subject to further condition in relation to catch pads and music.",
    "Officer report: \r\rThis application seeks to provide all market units as shared ownership units on such terms that would satisfy condition 2 of Regulation 49 of the CIL Regulations 2010 and meet the same criteria / definitions as the 19 shared ownership units currently required to be delivered (as a minimum) in the s106\r\rAll 125 affordable dwellings will be transferred to the registered provider Square Roots Registered Provider Limited (company number 13011644) [Square Roots]. Grant funding from the Mayor of London / GLA has also been secured to assist with all the units being delivered as affordable as per the agreed tenure mix. \r\rThe s106 is being varied to secure all the units as affordable in the s106 in order to obtain CIL social housing relief for all 125 units and associated residential ancillary space.\r\rThe proposal does not constitute a change of use for which planning permission is required. As such, the DOV is granted. \r\r\r",
    "The Householder Validation Local List requires Time Stamped Photographs of the site to be provided with the application submission. Please see the Local List for further guidance and submit these.\r",
