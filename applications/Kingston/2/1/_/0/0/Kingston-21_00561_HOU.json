    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the eastern elevation wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the eastern elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Application Site: \rThe site comprises commercial property on the corner of High Street and Kings Avenue, New Malden. The ground floor is currently Class 2 Bank with the upper floors both office space and residential.\r\rThe site is not located within a conservation area nor is it, or located nearby to, a statutory listed building and non-designated heritage assets but falls under New Malden District Centre Inset Area which has an Article 4 in place. \r\rProposal: \rSub division of an existing ground floor to create 2nos Class E commercial units, installation of new shopfronts and insertion of new windows in flank elevation and new fire escape door in rear elevation.\r\rRelevant History: \r24/02428/CPU: Change of use from Class E c) (i) to Class E e). Withdrawn 12.12.2024. \r\r24/03130/FUL - Change of use of the ground floor from Financial and Professional Services (Use Class E (c) (i)) to Use Class E u(a-e and g). Pending consideration at time of writing this report.\r\rConsultation:\rA total of 43 neighbours were consulted and no response was received. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \rThe key areas of assessment are:\rPrinciple of Development \rCharacter and Design \rLoss of employment space\rFire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development:\rNPPF at para 85 states planning decisions should help create the conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business needs and wider opportunities for development.\r\rLP Policy E1  sets out that improvements to the quality, flexibility and adaptability of office space of different sizes should be supported by new office provision, refurbishment and mixed use development. Part E further sets out that existing viable office floorspace capacity should be retained, supported by Borough Article 4 Directions to remove permitted development rights where appropriate. Parts G and H recognises development proposals related to new or existing offices should take into account the need for a range of suitable workspace including lower cost and affordable workspace and that the scope for the re-use of otherwise surplus large office spaces for smaller office units should be explored. Part I confirms the redevelopment, intensification and change of use of surplus office space to other uses including housing is supported, subject to the provisions of Parts G and H. \r\rCS Policy DM17 acts to protect existing employment land and premises to meet business needs and provide employment.  The policy is clear that alternative uses will not be acceptable unless it has been demonstrated by sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. Mixed use development schemes should not result in a net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) and should not compromise the viability of the site and/or its surroundings for employment purposes. Residential use within mixed use schemes will not be appropriate where it would be incompatible with established employment uses, or prejudicial to the site's continued operation for employment purposes.\r\rThe ground floor of the existing premise contains Class E commercial floorspace  previously used as a bank. The proposal would sub-divide this area to create 2no. Separate commercial units (one of which would be a dentist). However, the proposed conversion would result in the loss of access to the current ancillary commercial floorspace that exists on the first floor and no explanation has been provided by the submission of existing or proposed first floor plans on what would happen to this area or how access to it could be retained. \r\rIn the absence of any evidence or Existing or Proposed Plans for the first floor level being submitted by the applicant, it is considered that the proposals would result in the loss of the existing first floor commercial floorspace due to the removal of the existing internal access to the first floor level and no replacement or alternative access being incorporated within the proposals.\r\rCS Policy DM17 is clear in protecting employment premises. Irrespective of the premises being vacant, no supporting information in the form of marketing evidence or other evidence to justify the loss of the employment floorspace on the first floor has been submitted. The site is in a highly sustainable location and could offer a range of suitable workspaces, including lower cost and affordable workspace. When considering the substantial loss of office space in the Borough as a whole in recent years and the significant demand for office space up to 2041 (as evidenced in the Employment Land Review 2022), the loss weighs heavily against the scheme and is contrary to the outcomes sought under LP Policy E1 and CS Policy DM17. \r\rCharacter and Design: \rNPPF para 131 states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. \r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. CS Policy CS8 and DM10 and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide SPD require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed alterations to the shopfront and side elevation would add vibrancy and vitality to the streetscene and  as such, would be acceptable in terms of design as they would be compatible with existing features in the direct vicinity\r\rOverall, the proposed external alterations to the building are considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design, in compliance with LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. The proposal would not result in adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the local area. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. CS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing enclosure, loss of light or privacy, in compliance with LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 17 in Council's Residential Design Guide SPD. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rHighways and Transportation: \rPara 115 of the NPPF states development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. LP Policy T4 echoes this by ensuring development proposals do not increase road danger. \r\rLP Policy T6(A) advises that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). CS Policy DM9 and DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards under the LP.  \r\rLP Policy T5 and CS Policy DM8 requires new development to provide cycle parking in accordance with minimum standards. \r\rThe site has a PTAL rating of 4 meaning it has very good public transport accessibility. There would be no increase or decrease of parking on site.\r\rIt is noted that proposed cycle and bin storage has been shown on the proposed floor plans however, no details of the size or type of refuse or cycle storage areas have been provided. Officers do not consider the lack of details enough to warrant refusal. If the proposal was otherwise acceptable, final details of the cycle and refuse/recycling storage areas would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. \r\rOverall, the proposal would not adversely impact on the local road network, and would provide sufficient cycle and refuse storage facilities, subject to final details being secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rFire Safety: \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rA Fire Strategy has been submitted that demonstrates the proposed development would provide suitable means of evacuation and fire safety standards, in accordance with LP Policy D12. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. \r\rThe proposals result in the net loss of employment floorspace at the first floor level of the property and no sound evidence or rigorous marketing has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for the employment space). The site could continue to offer a range of suitable workspaces including lower cost and affordable workspace, due to its highly sustainable location within New Malden District Centre. The net loss of employment floorspace carries significant weight against the scheme.\r\rThe design or external alterations are acceptable and would not result in unacceptable impacts on neighbouring amenity. These are neutral matters.\r\rFinal refuse and recycling details could be secured by condition. \r\rConclusion:\rFor this scheme, the adverse impacts of the development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole. As such, Officers recommend planning permission be refused.\r",
