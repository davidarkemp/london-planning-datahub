    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",

    "As a matter of fact and degree, and on the basis of the layout shown on the submitted drawings and the accompanying information, it is considered that the no material change of use would occur. Were the premises to operate primarily as a restaurant, rather than a pub, the applicant is advised that planning permission would be required for a change of use from Public House (sui generis) to Class E (restaurant). Were the first floor accommodation to be used in a way other than as ancillary accommodation to the use of the ground floor public house, planning permission would likely also be required."
