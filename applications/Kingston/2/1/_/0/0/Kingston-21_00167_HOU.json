    "The proposed design, colour and materials of the door and window frames would not relate well to the host property or the immediate surrounding area, thereby resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area and less than substantial  harm to the significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area that would not be outweighed by any public beneift. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 196 of the NPPF 2019, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling within the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: An area of several cohesive groups of two storey red brick houses built between 1893 and 1904.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side infill extension. Alteration to existing single storey extension roof to wrap around with new extension.\r\rIt is noted that this application follows a recently refused application 24/00201/HOU dated 20.03.2024 which was refused for the following reason:\r\r1) The proposed extension by reason of its height and depth along the shared boundary with No.18 Balaclava Road would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to the closest ground floor habitable room window at 18 Balaclava Road and would be overbearing and result in an undue sense of enclosure.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis reason would need to be fully addressed in order for this application to be successful.\r\rConsultation\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rSurbiton CAAC: No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: In terms of design / appearance the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed development would be situated to the rear of the existing dwellinghouse. Officers note that the proposed roof of the scheme has been amended therefore reducing the overall impact on daylight but the eaves height would still remain heigher than a permitted development boundary fence which is limited to 2 metres. The depth of the proposed extension up to the boundary (a depth of approximately 5.9m along the shared boundary) would still result in an undue sense of enclosure and remains unneighbourly with regards to loss of outlook.  Regarding No. 22 Balaclava Road,  the proposed extension would not project beyond the rear-most elevation such that there would be a significant adverse impact on neighbouring amenity. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 18 Balaclava Road by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of outlook and the previous reason for refusal has not been fully addressed.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
