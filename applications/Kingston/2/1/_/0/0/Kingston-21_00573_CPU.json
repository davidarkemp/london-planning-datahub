  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. \r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers comment: The proposed side/rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 7.8m, however, it would only extend beyond the original/existing outrigger by approximately 1.4m, therefore this aspect of the proposal would fall within the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33, of the Redistentail Design SPD. Additionally, the applicant proposes a modest parapet height of approximately 3m and this would not be visible in the street scene. As such, the proposed single-storey rear/side extension would appear subordinate to the host dwelling and would not cause significant harm to the host dwelling or the wider area.\r\rRegarding the proposed alteration to the outrigger roof, Policy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD mentions avoiding flat roofs unless it is a feature that already exists as part of the dwelling. Whilst the proposal introduces a flat roof, it would not cause significant harm to the main dwelling or the immediate vicinity, as flat roofs are not an unusual feature on Elm Road. Additionally, the introduction of a flat roof dormer extension as part of this development would also create some sort of balance for the dwelling as a whole. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed dormer would not maintain 500mm from the sides, eave or ridge, however, this style of dormer is not uncommon on Elm Road and the extension is to the rear of the property therefore, not visible in the streetscene. \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
