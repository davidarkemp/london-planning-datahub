    "The proposed development, due to its excessive bulk, scale and mass and design would fail to respect the character and appearance of the original property, to the extent that all of its original features would be completely lost. Furthermore, its design would be completely out of character with other properties on the street, which would result in an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contray to Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide 'Time Stamp Photo'. It is validation requirement.",
    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 13 (landscaping) of planning permission 22/02199/FUL\r\rThe wording of Condition 13 (landscaping) of planning permission 22/02199/FUL.\r\rPrior to the beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a hard and soft landscaping scheme, including the treatment of boundaries and means of enclosure, shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced during the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant has deposited a Landscape Plan.  The details have been reviewed by the LPA's Tree and Landscape Officer who finds the details to be acceptable. Officers conclude that the details meet the requirements of condition 13 (landscaping) of planning permission 22/02199/FUL."
