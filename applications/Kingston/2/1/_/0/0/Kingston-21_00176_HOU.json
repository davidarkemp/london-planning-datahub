    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the south-western flank elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site: \r\rThe application relates to a 1930s detached property with a red brickwork base, rendered first floor, tiled roof and timber framed windows with metal glazing bars. The property is located within the Kingston Vale Conservation Area within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The property is setback from Robin Hood Lane behind St John the Baptist's Church which is a Building of Townscape Merit. Kingston Vale War Memorial within the grounds of the church is a Grade II listed monument. \r\rProposal: \r\rReplacement of existing timber and metal windows with aluminium windows at St John's Vicarage, Robin Hood Lane, Kingston Vale SW15 3PY. \r\rThe proposed replacement windows will be in the same position and will have the same size and generally the same opening style to the existing windows. \r\rRelevant History: \r\rMultiple applications for works to protected trees have been granted on the site. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA notification was published in the local newspaper on 18.07.2024 and site notices were installed around the site. A total of 10 neighbours were consulted. No responses were received. \r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Committee was consulted and did raise any objections. \r\rCouncil's Conservation and Heritage Officer was consulted and did not raise any objection to the replacement windows as they would be double glazed and would match the existing on the host property. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\rPrinciple of Development \rCharacter, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets\r\rPrinciple of development: \r\rThe Development Plan is generally supportive of people extending or altering their properties. The principle of development is supported, subject to details.\r\rCharacter, Design and Heritage Impacts: \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. Paragraphs 205-214 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rCouncil's Conservation and Heritage Officer has reviewed the application and confirms the Vicarage is a positive contribution to the Conservation Area and has associations with the St John the Baptist Church. \r\rThe applicant has confirmed the replaced windows will be double-glazed for improved thermal efficiency which aligns with the objectives of Policy CS1 and CS2 and Policy DM3 of the Core Strategy (2012). Officers are also satisfied the proposed aluminium replacement windows will generally match the existing windows on the host property that already have metal elements, in compliance with Policy CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012). Officers are satisfied the proposal will not impact the appearance and character of the conservation area.",
    "The proposal includes replacement of the windows, therefore please provide existing and proposed window section."
