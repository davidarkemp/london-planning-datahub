    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous feature that would erode the spaciousness between the application site and No.1 Motspur Park creating a dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive feature in the streetscene that would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and conflict with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate in the absence of a supporting daylight/sunlight report/survey that the neighbouring occupiers would have an adequate provision of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r23/02813/HOU - Demolition of an existing store/garage and erection of a single storey rear extension. refused 18.12.2023 for the following reason:\r\r1) By reason of height, depth and siting along the shared boundary, the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 18 Columbia Avenue as it would lead to a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground floor window and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2023, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a staggered depth from the rear wall/existing rear extension of approximately 4.5m to 3.5m (on the boundary shared with No.18 Columbia Avenue and a flat roof height of approximately 3.8m. Although the depth would fall outside the guidance of the Residential Design SPD for semi-detached dwellings, it would not be visible from the streetscene, it would have a relatively modest height and the proposed material would be similar to the existing dwelling.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application with a similar development which was refused, as it would have led to a significant loss of daylight to the closet ground floor window of No.18 Columbia Avenue.  The applicant has now submitted revised details showing a reduction in the depth of 1m on the boundary shared with No.18 Columbia Avenue. Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe proposed development would fail the BRE 45-degree rule on elevation but not on plan indicating that there would not be a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground-floor window at No. 18 Columbia Avenue. Additionally, the depth of 3.5m on the boundary would be an acceptable depth for single-storey rear extension for a semi-detached dwelling according to Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground-floor habitable room of No. 22 Columbia Avenue, due to an appropriate separation distance. \r\rGiven the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "All applications that involve extensions of 2 or more storeys, or where the resultant extension / development is above 2 storeys in height i.e. roof extension must provide \"25 Degree\" Elevation Plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the '25 degree rule'.
