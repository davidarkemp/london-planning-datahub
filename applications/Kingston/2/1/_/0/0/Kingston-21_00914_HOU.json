    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and detailed design of the proposed front dormer, unbalances the row of dwellings at 1b to 3b Gibbon Road and appears as an incongruous feature within the Gibbon Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
