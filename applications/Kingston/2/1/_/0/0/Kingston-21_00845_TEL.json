    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location as it would both constitute inappropriate development in the Metropolitan Open Land and would also create an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views of the site and detract from the character and appearance of the area. In the absence of very special circumstances being demonstrated that would individually or cumulatively outweigh the substantial weight to be given to the harm to the Metropolitan Open Land and the other harm identified the development proposed would not accord with paragraphs 143 - 147 of the National Planning Policy Framework and policies G3 of the London Plan and CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposed to erect a single-storey side extension in the place of the existing single-storey side extension; the proposed extension would not have a setback from the front elevation but rather be in line, falling outside Policy Guidance 35, of the Residential Design SPD. However, officers note that several neighbouring properties in the vicinity of Endway benefit from side extensions that would not maintain a set-back, therefore, the proposed development would not appear incongrous.\r\rIt is noted that the applicant instead constructed this with a flat roof. Even though this would not respect the overall roof form of the host dwelling, the applicant has incorporated a pitch slope towards the front of the extension to resemble the main roof. Overall, the single-storey side extension would appear subordinate and proportionate to the host dwelling and, as such, would be acceptable. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed first-floor side extension towards the would be visible in the streetscene, however, it would be reasonably set back and would be a roof form that respects the roof of the original dwelling, as such also appearing as though it was built with the original dwelling.\r\rOverall, on balance, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
