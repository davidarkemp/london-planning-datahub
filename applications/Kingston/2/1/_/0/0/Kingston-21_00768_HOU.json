    "The proposed extension would unduly enclose 78 Northcote Road and unacceptably limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r- 2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r- 21/01796/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (4.50m in depth, maximum height of 3.34m and eaves height of 2.50m). Prior Approval Refused 19.07.2021 for the following.\r\r1. It has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would not have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed development would therefore not fall within the parameters of Class A.1 (j) (iii) & (ja) of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\r2. It has not been demonstrated that materials would be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse and therefore the proposal  would not comply with condition A.3 (a) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear would have a total depth of approximately 4.3m and a flat roof height of approximately 3.2m. Officers acknowledge that the extension would have a depth that would fall outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD, however, the extension would not be visible in the streetscene, would still appear subordinate to the host dwelling and would not be an incongruous addition in the immediate vicinity.\r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities, it is noted that the extension would not breach the BRE test regarding No. 62 Duke Avenue. Officers acknowledge that the extension would fall within the 45-degree line when assessing the proposal on plan, however, the proposal would fall outside the line when determining the extension on plan. Therefore, the proposed extension would not cause a significant light loss to neighbouring properties.\r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The submitted block plan does not show the position of proposed shutters, please provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r"
