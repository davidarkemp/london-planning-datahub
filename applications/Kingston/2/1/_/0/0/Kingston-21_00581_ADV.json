    "The surrounding area is predominantly residential in character, the proposed signage is significantly larger in scale than the existing signage on site (in the same location on the highway boundary), and less lightweight in its structure and appearance unlike the existing signage that has some open space between the front boundary fence and sign itself, as such the proposed signage would be highly prominent and would have an unacceptable impact on the residential character and appearance of the area. The signage would be in direct view of adjoining properties as well as properties on the opposite side of the road, given the poor quality design of the signage coupled with its scale, it would have an unacceptable impact on their residential amenity. \r\rThe proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and paragraph 136 of the NPPF (2021).\r"
