    "The proposed erection of a porch and rear dormer roof extension with the installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion. falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, C & D of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Missing documents - the Application Form refers to a Covering Letter, but no letter was submitted, while the Planning Statement refers to Appendices, but there are none. \rPlease note that the submission currently consists of the Application Form, Planning Statement, Operations and Maintenance Guide and Fee payment. Please confirm if this is correct, or submit any additional information as necessary.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe proposal is for erection of raised patio area which would be significantly bigger than the approved (not raised) one under planning permission 24/00672/FUL. The proposal would also include alterations to the proposed landscaping as approved under application for discharge of Condition 8 (detailed landscape & planting plan) ref 24/01632/CLC (discharged on 05.09.2024).\r\rOfficers note the pending enforcement case relating to extension of terrace.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed amendments (due to their scale and siting) would require an additional assessment on the amenity and character and appearance of the proposal and would therefore require a S73 application to amend the original permission."
