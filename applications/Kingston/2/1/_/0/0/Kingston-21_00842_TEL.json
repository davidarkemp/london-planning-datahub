    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance and in particular its height would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with but detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Moreover, the introduction of additional apparatus on the footway would result in clutter, reduce the width of the functional footway, and would inconvenience users of the footway.\r\rThe proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers acknowledge that Policy Guidance 38 of the Residential Design SPD states that proposed porches should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. However, the proposed porch would have a roof form that respects the main roof, it would be small in scale, and porch extensions of this style are not unusual in the immediate vicinity. \r\rTherefore, on balance, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, '45 Degree' Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting and distance of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
