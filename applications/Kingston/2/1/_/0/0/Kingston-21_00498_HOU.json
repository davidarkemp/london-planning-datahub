  "description": "Demolition of existing conservatory. Erection of single storey rear and first floor side extensions. Rear and side dormer roof extensions with chimney stack removal and installation of 2no front rooflights to faciliate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration. Extension of existing dropped kerb.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the first floor side extension, would necessitate the loss of the characteristic cat-slide roof and would unduly close the gap between No. 12 Branksome Way, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the overprovision of off-street car parking spaces, would fail to promote sustainable modes of transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019, policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling. \r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes to raise the roof of the existing mid-terrace property to allow for a dormer roof extension to the rear.  Whilst officers acknowledge that there is scope for a dormer to the rear of the property, the proposed raised roof would appear odd amongst the row of terrace property and in the wider area. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, massing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a sufficient Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
