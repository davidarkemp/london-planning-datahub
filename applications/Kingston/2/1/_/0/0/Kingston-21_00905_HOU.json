    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the southern elevation wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The local planning authority must be satisfied that the amendment sought is non-material in order to grant an application under section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\rThe applicant seeks to amend the wording of condition 19 of planning permission ref: 21/03821/KPSID to remove compliance with the Surface Water Drainage Strategy(initially submitted under 21/03821/KPSID) and add submitted document: Surface Water Drainage Strategy Addendum (Shockledge, September 2024). \r\rThe councils Local Lead Flood Authority was consulted and do not object to the proposed changes to the surface water drainage strategy and state that the proposed Non-Material amendments do not adversely affect the sustainable surface water drainage of the site.\r\rThe applicant has confirmed that the proposed changes would not contradict the granted planning permission ref: 23/01718/NMA. As the amended wording would not materially affect or change the approved development, the proposed amendment is considered to be non-material.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Conversion of garage into a habitable space and erection of a single storey rear infilled extension'.",
