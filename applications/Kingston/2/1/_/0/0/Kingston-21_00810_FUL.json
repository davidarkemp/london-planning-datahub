    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would have the appearance of being shoe-horned into the site creating an incongruous addition to surrounding area that would be a dominant, overbearing visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and erode the spaciousness and visual relief between the built form of St James Road and Maple Road and compete with and detract from the setting of the Statutorily Listed St Andrews Church when viewed from St James Road and fail to preserve or enhance and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the St Andrews Square Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm of which the public benefit of providing one additional residential unit would not outweigh. The proposal therefore would not accord with sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 186 - 202 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would compromise the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers at the rear of properties in Maple Road and front of St James Road opposite creating a dominant and overbearing feature and unnecessary sense of enclosure that would diminish and be to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers.",
    "The proposed siting and design of the future amenity space is such that it would result in a loss of privacy to future occupants as a result of direct overlooking from the rear of properties in Maple Road and therefore the proposed development would not accord with policies DM 10 and DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "The proposed development has a high number of single aspect rooms with a northern outlook and in the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the future occupants of the proposed development would have adequate provision of daylight/sunlight and therefore the proposed development would not accord with policies DM 10 and DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "In the absence of a signed and completed legal agreement to prevent future occupants from obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits to mitigate the potential demand for additional on street parking as a result of the development which could lead to congestion and in turn could prejudice highway safety the proposal  would not accord with policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "Please provide  the position and dimensions of windows, doors and walls and proposed use of each room.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r6 no surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for conversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, erection of a single storey side and rear extension.\r\rSite\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposed rear extension will replace the existing garage to provide extra habitable space to the house. It will have modest scale and appropriate design and position with a sloping roof. It would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse. \r\rOverall it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse. It is considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rIn terms of the impact on no.18, the proposal will pass the 45 degree rule against its rear opening. Given its scale and position, it would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn terms of the impact on no.22, the rear wall of the proposed extension will be in line with the existing rear structure of no.22. Therefore, it would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rGiven the modest scale, appropriate design and position, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the neighbouring properties to its rear by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Statement. Officers are satisfied that the current fire safety measures are appropriate and will not be adversely affected by the development and therefore it adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r\r\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r18 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rKingston and North Kingston Neighbourhood CAAC - No objection, but this is locally listed building so the intention of the applicant to clad the new rear extension with black timber must be actioned with sensitivity  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  the demolition of an existing rear extension. Erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\r\rThe application site is within  Fairfields/Knights Park Conservation Area and comprises a locally listed building.  The site also resides within Area of Archaeological Significance 2.2. Kingston Town. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to demolish an existing rear extension and erection of single storey rear extension. \r\rDue to the modest scale, siting and the proposed design, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset (Fairfield /Knights Park Conservation Area), Paragraph 207 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe site is located within the Fairfield/Knights Park Crescent Conservation Area.  The proposal would result in a small  increase in the footprint of the property at  the rear  in comparison to the existing which would not be visible from public view. It is considered that there would be a small impact on the character of the plot layout and the proposal would have a neutral impact on the significance of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form, and noting the above assessment, it is considered that the proposed  single storey rear extension would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area  and it is considered that the proposal would not result in less than substantial harm to the the significance of the  Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area.\r\rWhilst the proposed single storey rear extension is modern in design in the context of 32 Orchard Road, a  locally listed building (non designated heritage asset), Officers consider it to be proportionate and subordinate addition to the existing dwelling  and  duly respectful in terms of the use of appropriate materials  which would compliment the locally listed building itself and its setting.   Within the context of the existing built form and noting the assessment above,  it is considered that the proposals  would not have any adverse impact on the character and appearance nor harm the significance  of the locally listed building.  \r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordanace with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Act  1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---Informatives---\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirements in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

A completed application form together with the detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to :\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on  the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groudnworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls. The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\"\r\rProperty Boudnaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override proprty rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check the plans submitted  for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the  next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays\r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority' , please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level/ Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before  and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of the Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's webside during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps:/www.kingston.gov.uk/info/20155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r\r\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a four storey terraced Building of Townscape Merit, located on the southern side of Clarence Street occupied by Barclays Bank. The application site falls within the Kingston Old Town Key Area of Conservation (K+20) and Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. It adjoins settings of Grade 1 Listed Building - All Saint Church and is situated opposite the Grade II Listed Building- Bentalls Centre.\r\rThe site falls within a Primary Shopping area and is located on a Primary Shopping Frontage. \r\rProposal \rDisplay of 2 no. internally illuminated ATM signs.\r\rConsultations\rKingston and North Kingston Neighbourhood Conservation Areas advisory Committee objects due to the following reasons:\r\rThe new ATM surround panels should be a less intrusive colour ie not white but eg blue such as the existing which are in keeping with the Barclays house style. Furthermore, like the existing surrounds they should not be illuminated which otherwise would intrude excessively on the public realm. \r\rRepresentations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy K11 (Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan) requires new developments to achieve a high standard of design that relates well to surrounding buildings and to retain and restore traditional features such as shop fronts, walls, paving: 'The Old Town Conservation Area is a key feature contributing to Kingston's attractive and distinctive character. It is important that features, which contribute positively to the character and appearance of the OTCA and add to its diversity, are retained and enhanced. These include its retail and hospitality role, especially in the historic core and Ancient Market Place, where these activities are the key to its vibrancy and vitality.'\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed halo illuminated ATM surround and illuminated logo letters would be similar in design and levels of illumination to the existing signage. However, the proposed signage would be installed to the white laminated panel that together with the proposed dark coloured aluminium panels (application ref 24/03140/FUL) and due to the proposed illumination would emphasise the proposed contrasting ATM surround that would result in a visually intrusive advertisement that would appear materially worse than the existing advertisement, resulting in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.   \r                                                                                                               \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  210 of the NPPF 2024 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 212 of NPPF 2024 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rParagraph 216 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset\r\rOfficer comment: The application property is located within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area lies in its historic status as an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period. It is close to (...) the old core of the town around All Saints Church and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is the best preserved of its type in outer London.\r\rThe application site adjoins to the west All Saints Church, Grade I Listed Building and is located opposite Grade II Listed Building The Bentalls Centre. \r\rThe application site is locally listed and it contributes positively to the conservation area. \r\rAs stated above, the proposed advertisement installed on a contrasting white panel, due to its  design and appearance  would appear as an intrusive signage adversely affecting the appearance and character of  the locally listed host building and the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and would result in less than substantial harm to its significance. No public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the siting and modest levels of the illumination (200cd/m2), the proposal would not result in significant impact on highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
