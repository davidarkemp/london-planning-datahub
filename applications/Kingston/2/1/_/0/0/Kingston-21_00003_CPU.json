    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor commercial unit (shop) in a mid terrace building, located within the designated Alexandra Drive Local Centre. The upper floors are in residential use. \r\rThe application site was used as a charity shop (Class Use E(a)) at least since 2008 as per photographic evidence on Google Maps.  \r\rProposal \rAlteration to shopfront.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as building regulations and given that the application relates to shopfront alterations any construction related impact would be minimal. \r\rThe other concerns will be addressed within this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alterations to the shopfront would comprise installation of new metal windows and in filling the small, recessed area to provide a straight shopfront. Given the proposed design, material and siting, it is considered that the proposed shopfront would be in-keeping with the host building and the surrounding area.\r\rIt is noted that the applicant has declared on the application form a change of use from Class Use E(a) (Display/Sale of goods other than hot food) to Class Use E(b) (Sale of food and drink for consumption mostly on the premises) which would likley be considered as the permitted development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns received regarding the potential loss of privacy and overlooking, however considering the proposed scale of works and their siting it is considered that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or undue overlooking in relation to the adjoining flats. The application site would remain in Class Use E and therefore it would be materially  similar to the existing use, not significantly changing the existing situation. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
