    "It has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that  the existing building was built after 1 July 1948. There is no planning or building control history to confirm when the block was erected. Historic mapping records indicate the building was constructed at some point between 1932 and 1956. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would satisfy the limitations set out at Paragraph A.1(c) of Class A of Part 20 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "The proposed development by reason of its design, bulk, and massing would detract from the appearance of the building and would appear visually intrusive and incongruous and would not be sympathetic to local character or the surrounding built environment, contrary to the NPPF (2019) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2021) and Condition A.A.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",

    "All applications that involve extensions of 2 or more storeys, or where the resultant extension / development is above 2 storeys in height i.e. roof extension must provide \"25 Degree\" Elevation Plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the '25 degree rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r",
