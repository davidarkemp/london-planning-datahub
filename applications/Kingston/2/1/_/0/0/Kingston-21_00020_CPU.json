    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Condition 4 (detailed drawings) of planning permission 23/01707/FUL states: \r\rPrior to the commencement of any development above ground level, detailed drawings at a\rscale of 1:10 or 1:20 of the following features shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority:\r(a) windows and doors, including any aprons, sills, mouldings, heads, jambs, transoms, mullions,\rlintels or reveals\r(b) typical balcony detail and railing\r(c) entrance canopy\r(d) signage/ building name\r(e) Roof top structures\r(f) Front boundary treatment\rThe development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved drawings.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe submitted information shows details of some typical features and various options for, for example, different types of doors shown on partially illegible plans pasted on the main drawing SCHR-AP2-C4(2). However the submission lacks of details specific to this project:\r\rDoes not show typical sections/drawings/details for all types of the windows to be installed and does not provide any information/clarification for relevant aprons, sills, mouldings, heads, jambs, transoms, mullions, lintels or reveals. Those details may be different for different floors.\r\rDoes not include any details for the horizontal banding above the windows, that is a distinctive architectural feature distinguishing the levels as per the original planning permission. \r\rIt is unclear how all the different types of the proposed doors (drawing Corporate W20 Doors General Arrangement) would be used and where they would be installed.\r\rTypical balcony detail and railing should be provided for each balcony type, there are no details for the top balcony and railing.\r\rThe submitted drawing for the front boundary treatment shows railing approximately 1.25m high while the proposed ground floor plan indicates the front boundary of approximately 1.85m. Any details relating to the proposed front boundary treatment should not be 'optional', they must be specific to the project. \r\rThe submitted details, especially the drawing Extensive/Intensive Green Roof System (Slope 5 degrees plus)  relating to the green roof are not specific enough to the proposal. It is unclear what is being proposed in this respect.\r\rGiven the above, it is considered that insufficient information has been provided for the architectural key elements of the proposal (windows, balconies, horizontal banding above the windows, front boundary treatment) to ensure satisfactory appearance and high quality design of the proposal, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rAny information to be submitted for forthcoming applications should be clear, legible and relating to the proposal and the specific condition to be discharged only. Officers note additional details showing proposed cycle spaces or waste and recycling arrangement, these should not form part of the submission relating to condition 4. \r",
    "The submitted location plan does not show the land required for access to the site from a public road/ highway. Please revise the red outline in the location plan to show the access from the public road.\r\rNote: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red and any other land owned by the applicant in blue. Red outline should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, car parking and open areas around buildings)."
