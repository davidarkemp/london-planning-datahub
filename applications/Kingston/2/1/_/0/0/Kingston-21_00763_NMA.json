    "The application as presented requests that the Local Planning Authority confirm the lawful use of the site, as set out in the Cover Letter \"We hereby request that the Local Planning Authority confirms the intended lawful use of 43 Fassett Road as two dwelling units\".\r\rAn application under Section 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 is one whereby the Local Planning Authority confirms whether a proposed amendment is material or non-material, taking into account the considerations as set out in the Act.\r\rThe correct way to confirm the lawfulness of a proposal would be through the submission of an application for a Certificate of Lawfulness under Section 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act. \r\rAs such, this application is recommended to be refused.",
    "The applicant has submitted details for the discharge of Condition 22 (Construction Management Plan) of planning permission 21/00646/FUL, the council Highways officer have assessed these details and provided the following comment:\r\r\rThe subject application has been submitted to fulfil the requirements for discharging Condition 22 (submission of a Construction Management Plan (CMP)) as stipulated in the approval notice for Application No. 21/00646/FUL, dated 22/03/2022.\r\rThe applicant has provided details of the construction work activities, which is considered satisfactory.\r \rAll construction activities will be carried out from Monday - Friday within the hours of 8am - 6pm and Saturdays, between 8am and 1pm. No work will be carried out outside the above stipulated working hours.\r\rAccording to the applicant, the unloading/loading of delivery vehicles will take place via the extended loading bay at the north end of New Malden High Street and within CNM Estates 20 car parking spaces in the Dukes Avenue car park. Deliveries will be on a 'just-in-time' basis and materials will be taken to the appropriate storage area within the site premises. All construction traffic entering and leaving the loading bay will be closely controlled and during delivery times, banksmen will be positioned at this location to control and record vehicle movements. This is considered acceptable. However, the contractor should ensure that materials or waste are not left or kept on the public highway or footway.\r\rThe CMP indicates that the majority of construction traffic will exit the A3 leading on to B283 to arrive at the New Malden High Street on-street loading bay. This is considered acceptable, however, the area is heavily congested particularly at peak times and delivery vehicles should not cause any undue disruptions. Therefore, the developer should be encouraged to schedule deliveries to occur during the off peak periods.\r\rAll site vehicles and contractors vehicles will be parked and secured within CNM Estates 20 car parking spaces in the Dukes Avenue car park during the construction period and not left unattended on the public highways at any time. Although this may be considered acceptable, due to the site location, including the next door New Malden train station, site operatives, contractor staff and visitors should be encouraged to use the public transport services (bus and train) and other sustainable travel modes to arrive at the site.\r\rAs stated in the CMP, directional signage will be implemented to ensure that construction traffic utilises designated haulage routes to minimise construction traffic effects on the surrounding road network. Also, signage and where necessary, traffic control systems within the site, will be implemented on all surrounding roads to provide warning of the construction site, directions and movement restrictions in the vicinity of the development. This is an acceptable safety measure.\r\rWith respect to statutory undertaker connections, the developer will consult with the necessary service providers and stakeholders, including RBK, and approvals obtained prior to any works. The project and its contractors will follow all the necessary guidelines set by the stakeholders. This is considered acceptable.\r\rThe applicant has not addressed or provided the following items in the submitted CMP:\r\ra) Details or a construction site layout plan to show the location of materials unloading/storage areas, welfare facilities and other ancillary site buildings;\r\rb) Location and details of a wheel washing facility;\r\rc) Measures for managing dust generation, noise suppression and abatement of other nuisance that may arise from the development works;\r\rd) Meeting the requirements of Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM); and\r\re) Method of recycling and disposing of waste resulting from the demolition and construction phases.\r\rBased on the above, Highways objects to the discharge of the subject Condition 22, for planning application no. 21/00646/FUL.",
    "PLEASE READ CAREFULLY: \r\rOn the 1st May 2024 the Council adopted a new Householder Local List. Please ensure that your application submission includes all the necessary documentation as required by the new local list. \r\rThen please complete and submit a Householder Checklist - Section 3 to confirm that you have provided all mandatory documents. The new Householder Local List and checklists can be obtained via the council's website: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\r\rThe LPA will not conduct any validation checks until the correct Checklist has been submitted. Upon receipt of a completed Checklist, the application will be assigned to a validation officer to review. Please do not simply state N/A anywhere in the checklist without a written justification. \r\rIf you need to make any changes to your application please try to do this via the Planning Portal website where possible. If that is not possible please send amended documents via the email address quoted in this letter. \r\r"
