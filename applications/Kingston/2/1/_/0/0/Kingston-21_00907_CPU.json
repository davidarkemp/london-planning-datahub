    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 3no. rooflights to front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",

    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 28 (Lighting) of planning permission 22/01359/FUL granted on 24.08.2023. This is a resubmission of a previously submitted application to discharge Condition 28 (reference no. 24/02976/CLC) which was refused due to insufficient information being submitted to demonstrate the proposed external lighting would not adversely impact foraging bats. \r\rCondition 28 requires details of the location and full specification of all lamps, light levels/spill lamps, support structures, hours of operation and technical details on how impacts on bat foraging would be minimised. \r\rThe Applicant has submitted a Lighting Design Report (prepared by Orlight Ltd, dated 20.02.2025), as well as specifications for the lighting columns, street lamps and bollard lights. The Lighting Design Report details luminance level and light spillage for all external areas, including pathways, car parking spaces and outdoor amenity areas. Average illuminance levels range from 14.2 lux to 43 lux. Since the previously refused application, the Cover Letter now confirms the luminaires would be controlled via a timeclock and dusk till dawn sensors. Luminaires would have no upward light ratio (beam angle would be maximum 130 degrees) and have a warm coloured temperature (3000k). Officers are satisfied the proposed lighting would not adversely impact foraging bats in compliance with the Bats and Artificial Lighting at Night Guidance Note prepared by the Institution of Lighting Professionals GN08/23. \r\rThe applicant is informed that the submitted details are agreed and that Condition 28 (Lighting) of planning permission 22/01359/FUL are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved."
