    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and would detract from both the character and appearance of the host property and be visually intrusive in the views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties in Claremont Gardens and the public realm of Surbiton Hill Road. It would also fail to preserve or enhance the significance of the Claremont Road Conservation Area, causing less than substantial harm that would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 202 of the NPPF and policies CS18, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and contains a tree that is subject to a Tree Preservation Order.\rThe application site is also situated within the 2.5 Coombe Hill Area of Archaeological Significance.\rThe application is not located within the Flood Risk Zones or Critical Drainage Area.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing rear conservatory and side corridor, erection of part two storey/part single storey rear, single storey side and front porch enclosure extension. Roof alteration with enlargement of existing loft space. Erection of boundary wall and gates with front boundary treatments.\r\rConsultations\r29 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Privacy\r- The proposal would appear as overbearing \r- The scale of the proposal is not characteristic to the area\r- Loss of privacy in the garden area\r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed with this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed total depth of part single part two storey rear extension would be approximately 8.1m (including a lean to), which would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth. However, due to the size of the plot, siting and the proposed scale as well as the proposed separation distances (approximately 2.25m to the boundary with No 52 and 3.3m to the boundary with No 48), it is considered that the proposed mass and bulk of the part single part two storey rear extension would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rWhile the total height of the dwelling would remain the same, the proposed hipped roof form due to its orientation would have the roof ridge set differently to the immediately adjoining properties that share similar design and positively contribute to the character and appearance of the area. Therefore, the proposed roof form would appear as intrusive and odd when viewed from Crescent Road, having an uncaptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension in isolation, due to its modest scale and siting is considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe proposed front porch and single storey side extensions, due to its scale, siting and the proposed design are considered to be acceptable.  \r\rThe proposal includes raised ground levels to facilitate the rear extensions, as per submitted drawing P.5024/A/212 D Existing and Proposed Cross Sectional Elevation, the difference between the proposed patio and the existing ground level would be approximately 1.4m. Insufficient information has been submitted to indicate the proposed changes in ground level across the site and in relation to the (estimated) ground levels at the adjoining properties to demonstrate that such an increase would be in-keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rWith regards to the proposed front boundary treatment, the submitted drawings show the proposed total height of approximately 1.9m (the proposed brick wall would be approximately 0.5m and railing would be approximately 1m high). However, it appears that the difference in ground levels was not captured on the submitted drawing, therefore it is unclear if the proposed front boundary as shown on the plans would be achievable and the open character of the area would be maintained. Officers note open boundary treatment with the immediate area that is characteristic to this cluster of dwellings that share symmetry and design. \r\rOfficers note the adjacent, protected trees to the front and the TPO tree within the application site which make a positive and valuable contribution to the quality of the public realm within Crescent Road and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area. It is considered that the loss of such trees as a result of the development would not be acceptable and would harm the overall character and appearance of the area. \r\rAs such, the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of robust evidence that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the protected trees which contribute towards the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 202 to 206 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 216 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an adverse impact to the host property would not relate well to the host property and have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns received with the written representations regarding impact of the proposal on the amenities of the adjoining properties. \r\rWith regards to No 48, it is noted that the proposed rear building line at the first floor level would be similar to the rear building line at No 48. \r\rHowever, given that No 48 is located on lower ground level compering to the application site and considering the proposed increase in ground level (up to 1.4m) and limited information to demonstrate the changes in ground levels (as well as no information on privacy screens), it is considered that insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate no adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of this adjoining property in terms of potential overbearing appearance and loss of privacy in the garden area.\r\rWith regards to No 52, due to the scale and siting of the proposal, it is considered not to appear as overbearing when viewed from No 50. \r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest primary habitable openings at both adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to these properties. \r\rAny new windows in the side elevations above the ground floor level would be obscure glazed and nonopenable below 1.7m, details of which could be secured via condition.\r\rInsufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal given the raised ground level  would not appear as overbearing or would not result in an unacceptable loss of privacy in relation to the adjoining property, No 48 Crescent Road.\r\rHighways Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed boundary treatment, the electric gate and new hardstanding are considered not to not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comments: No information (such as an Arboriculture Method Statement and Tree Protection Fencing) has been submitted to demonstrate no adverse impact of the proposal on the TPO trees located on the application site and close to the front boundaries at the adjoining properties. \r\rArcheology\rThe application site is situated within the Archaeological Priority Areas - Tier 2. According to the archaeological risk model provided by Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service, any householder developments situated within the Tier 2 Archaeological Priority Area are posing negligible risk, which means developments only rarely causing harm to heritage assets of archaeological interest and hardly ever causing significant harm.\r\rAs such, due to the  modest scale of the proposal and its siting, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in significant harm to heritage assets of archaeological interest. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
