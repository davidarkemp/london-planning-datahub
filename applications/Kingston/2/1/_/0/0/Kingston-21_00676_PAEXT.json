    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor commercial unit and is located in the designated Kingston Town Centre and the Kingston Old Town Conservation a designated heritage asset. The building is also a locally listed building. \r\rNeighbour notification - no response received  \r\rKTCAAC - object on grounds of the size and design. \r\rProposal \rDisplay of ATM tablet advertisements\r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity \r\rThe signage would be located on the front of the building on the surrounds of the ATM. The site fronts the Market Place. \r\rThe building occupies a prominent position in the street scene. The signage consisting of 3 ATM tablet signs surrounding the ATM's is considered to be of a size, design and material finish that is not of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property.  It is considered that the signage proposed would be out of keeping with the existing signage to be replaced which is of a more subservient and proportionate nature to the facade of the building and would break the symmetry of the fenestration of the existing building. Furthermore the bright vibrant colour finish of the signage is considered to be unsympathetic to the existing external finishes of the building and the signage would be visually intrusive and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property. Overall it is considered that the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the area which forms part of the designated heritage asset, the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and would detract from the special architectural integrity of the non-designated heritage asset the locally listed building causing less than substantial harm to the designated and no designated heritage assets.  \r\rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 195 - 214 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r\r",
