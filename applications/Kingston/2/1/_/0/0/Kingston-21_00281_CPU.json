    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "he application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the the approved scheme 17/15107/FUL. It is proposed to alter the mix and number of units approved and alter and extend the fourth floor and make changes to the facade(s) of the building approved. The changes proposed requires changes to the operative part of planning permission ref: 17/15107/FUL and would result in a change to the design and appearance of the building and the external and internal layout of the building. These changes both individually and cumulatively are considered to be material. \r\rIt is concluded that the changes do not constitute a non material amendment to planning permission 17/15107/FUL.",
