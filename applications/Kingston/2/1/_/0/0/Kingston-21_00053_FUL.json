    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on trees.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 3m from the rear wall and a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.6m with an eave height of approximately 2.5m. Development of this style would not be incongruous in the vicinity of Alexandra Road as several dwellings benefit from similar rear extensions.\r\rThe proposed attached side extension would not be set back from the front wall by a minimum of 500mm, as requested by Policy Guidance 35, of the Residential Design and whisltÂ officers acknowledge that the proposed development would be visible in the streetscene, development of this style would appear subordinate. Additionally, the proposed fenestration and material use would aid in making the extension appear as though it was built with the original dwelling.Â \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.Â  \r\rGiven the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comments: Officers acknowledge that the applicant has submitted a Tree Impact Plan which identifies a number of trees on site,Â including Lime Species which has a Tree Preservation Order in place. The Council's Trees and Landscapes Officer has reviewed the proposal and noted that the submitted documents do not include an arboricultural impact assessment (AIA) and/or an arboricultural method statement (AMS). Therefore, an appropriate assessment of the effects of the proposed can not be sufficiently considered.\r\rIn the absence of the requested information it cannot be determined that no harm to, or loss of, retained trees which contribute positively to the character of the area would occurr.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that Condition 28 (Drainage Strategy) of planning permission 21/03204/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extensions and conversion of single dwelling into 3nos. self contained flats\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and 6 objections from 4 different addresses have been received stating;\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r - Effects on trees\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Fumes\r - Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r - Storage of hazardous substances\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The principal of development;\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Standard of accommodation; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2021.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of The London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10-year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10-year period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThe proposed development would result in a net increase of 2 Class C3 market dwellinghouses which would make a positive, albeit modest, contribution towards housing supply. \r\rPolicy DM13 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will ensure that the housing delivered is of high quality and the most appropriate type. The Policy also states that new residential development is expected to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types. The policy requires that 30% of the proposed units should have 3 or more bedrooms unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable.\r\rPolicy DM 14 of the Core Strategy seeks to resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types) and, in particular, dwellings which are suitable for family accommodation. To protect existing family units that meet an identified need, the Council will, where necessary, limit the conversion of family units into houses in multiple occupation.\r\rThe existing dwelling is a 3-bed dwelling house capable of providing family accommodation. However, the proposal would provide a 1 x 3 bed unit capable of providing family accommodation which would offset the loss.\r\rThe principle of development is considered to be acceptable subject to the material planning considerations below.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge an extension has already been permitted to the rear of the property, a further extension to this already large extension would result in an incongruous and visually dominant extension and it is considered that there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, officers acknowledge that a large single storey rear extension 7.9m in depth and 2.7m in height was previously permitted under planning application 22/03029/HOU dated 28.11.2022 which has been implemented. A further extension to the depth of this extension of another 2.7 metres is considered to be unacceptable due the undue sense of enclosure and overbearing appearance that the further depth would create to the adjoining neighbour. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high-quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rWith regards to private amenity space, a minimum of 10sqm should be provided. Private amenity space would only be provided for two out of the three flats which would not meet the minimum requirements\r\rProposed sections have been provided to demonstrate that internal floor levels would be at least 2.5m in height for at least 75% of the Gross Internal Area (GIA).  \r\rWith regards to the proposed Studio flat, officers note that due to its position within the property, this flat would lack privacy and defensible space as it would front onto the garden for Flat 1. There would also be a  poor levels of outlook.  It is also unclear whether Flat 1 would achieve sufficient levels of daylight or sunlight given the orientation of the property and deep floor plates. No Daylight & Sunlight Assessment has been submitted.\r\rOverall, Officers find the highest standard of accommodation has not been achieved, and the proposal fails to meet the standards and requirements set in Policy D6 of the London Plan,Nationally Described Space Standards and the RBK Residential Design Guide.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a floor plan showing some fire alarms and assembly points not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions should permission be granted. For this reason, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "Details required for Conditions 4 (Construction Management Plan) and 15 (PEA) of planning permission 23/01059/FUL (Demolition of dwelling and erection of 1no. 3 bed replacement dwelling, and erection of 3no. 4 bed dwellings to rear with new access road)\r\rCondition 4: \rConstruction Management Plan (CMP)  confirms that the proposed development will be undertaken over a duration of 48 weeks and the developer has briefly elaborated on the work activities and programme in the CMP.\rAll construction activities will be carried out from Monday - Friday within the hours of 8am - 6pm and Saturday; 8am - 1pm. No work will be carried out on Sundays and bank holidays.\rThe developer notes the presence of the nearby St Paul's School, which is also located on Orchard Road. As such they (Developer) will ensure there are no deliveries between 8am - 9am and 2.45pm - 3.45pm, during term times. This is an acceptable measure.\r\rAccording to the developer, the majority of deliveries will come from Buildbase in Cox lane, near the site and the delivery route which will be agreed with Buildbase, will be via Kingston Road, left to the Tolworth Roundabout on the A3 and to the A3 Hook Road Roundabout from where the delivery vehicles will connect to the Orchard Road site. However, it can be observed that the Buildbase store is approx. 4 minutes drive from the site, compared to the proposed A3 route, which may appear to be longer. As such, the contractor/supplier should be requested to strictly use the proposed A3 route and avoid going through the short 4 minute internal route, which goes through mostly residential areas. Map sketches have been provided to show the routes.\r\rThe CMP indicates that connections for relevant utilities will be required. According to the developer, the relevant utility companies will apply for the appropriate street works licences and any relevant traffic management will be undertaken by them.\rThe location of the materials storage area, welfare unit and car parking for contractor staff, have been provided in a location map.\rThe CMP has outlined satisfactory control measures for dust and noise on the site.\r\rThe Highways team have confirmed that the CMP covers the key requirements for the proposed development and as such it is considered acceptable.\r Â ",
