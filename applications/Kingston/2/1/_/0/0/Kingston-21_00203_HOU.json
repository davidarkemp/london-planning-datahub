    "The proposed first floor side extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and would be visually intrusive in the streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the existing streetscene and surounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey side extension\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The end of terrace properties on Amberwood Rise show the front staggered building line that helps to define the boundary between the row of terraces. The proposed front infill extension would disturbed this pattern. However, Officers note that the application site benefits from permitted development rights and a similar scale front infill extension may constitute permitted development. Given this 'fallback' position, the proposal is considered to be acceptable in this case.\r\rIt is further noted that a similar extension was granted planning permission at No 70 Amberwood Rise, ref no 23/03315/HOU, however the sitting of this property is different to the application site.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIt is noted that the principle habitable window at the ground floor in the front elevation at the adjoining property No 56 would not be affected. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposal benefits from  permitted development rights 'fallback' position and considering that it would not result in an adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining property No 56 it is considered to be acceptable in this case. \r",
