    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.

Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r6no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of an existing rear storage and erection of single storey side/ rear infill extension.  \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises  a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r12/12414/HOU -  Erection of a piggy back roof to facilitate loft conversion. Granted 01.08.12\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the demolition of rear storage and erection of single storey side/ rear infill extension. \r\rThe dwelling has an existing single storey rear storage structure with a single aspect roof which extends across the width of the dwelling forming a canopy which is supported by a  single column. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side / rear infill extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been received relating to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Overbearing Nature\r- Inaccuracy of submitted drawings \r- Breach of privacy \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes a first-floor extension on top of the existing single-storey rear extension and a two-storey rear infill extension in replacement of the existing conservatory. \r\rThe proposed two-storey rear extension to the north of the dwelling would have a sufficient distance from the boundary shared with No.5 Neville Avenue and would have a roof form that respects the host dwelling.\r\rWhilst the proposed font porch would not respect the host dwelling roof pitched roof form, it would be small in scale and would appear subordinate to the host dwelling, therefore, on balance, it would be acceptable.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 of the Residentai Design SPD states that two-storey extensions may be acceptable where dwellings sit on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwellings and adequate separation distances should be maintained between neighbouring properties. Whilst officers note that the extension to the south of the dwelling is for a first-floor extension, however, upon completion of the development this would be considered a two-storey extension. The extension in question would closely sit on the boundary shared with neighbouring property No. 7 The Fairway, only maintaining a separation distance of approximately 700m. No. 7 and No. 9 currently sit in very close proximity to each other, therefore, building up close to the boundary shared with No.7 The Fairway would lead to a cramped look, thereby, harming the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high-quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment As noted above the proposal would not generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, therefore, officers consider that the proposed development would cause significant harm to the character and appearance of The Fairway or the host dwelling. As such, the proposed development would harm the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted plans showing the BRE 45-degree test, to demonstrate that the extension to the southern elevation would not cause harm to amenity of No.7 The Fairway, in regards to light. However, they have not submitted the same assessment showing the effects of the proposed development on elevations. Subsequently, officers conducted the BRE-45 degree rule on elevation and found that the proposed development would fail on both plan and elevation. \r\rAdditionally, due to the layout of the site in relation to No.7 The Fairway the proposed development would appear overbearing. \r\rWhilst officers note the concerns raised in regards to windows facing neighbouring properties to the side elevations, the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that the proposed development would have obscured glazing and be non-opening or no part of the framework less than 1.7 above finished floor level shall be openable \r\rOverall,  given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r24/02842/HOU - Erection of rear piggy back roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Refused on 20.01.2025 for the following reason:\r\r1) The proposed development would be incongruous and would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area. In this regard, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Guidance 2012.\r \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted a similar application under planning ref: 24/02842/HOU which was refused as the proposed piggyback extension did not maintain 4m from the front elevation falling outside Policy Guidance 40, of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe applicant has now amended the proposed piggyback roof extension and would follow the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 40 by having materials and detailing that would complement the original house, not increasing the height of the eaves and ridge by more than 1.3m, respecting the roof design of the main dwelling and maintaining 4m from the front elevation. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development would respect the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate vicinity. Overall,  the proposed development would appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, therefore, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed roof extension, using the BRE, 25 and 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r22 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  1 letter of  support  received .\r\rMaldens and Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee  - comments received  refers to lack of detail.  The householder checklist states it is not in a conservation area - yet it is - and that no trees are affected - yet the extension is building up the property boundary and on the satellite image trees are shown close by in the neighbouring property. The change in cladding to metal from tile may have an effect on the character. Design and access, heritage and arboriculturist statements should be considered in a resubmttted application.It's extraordinary that this application has been validated without the required information in order to be able to assess fully the impact of the proposal\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer - no objection. Further detail provided in the report. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of single storey side extension, internal alterations, changes to fenestration and external cladding alterations. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe application site is adjacent to Coombe Wood Conservation Area.

Granted 19.10.77\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Trees\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey side extension, internal alterations, changes to fenestrations and external cladding alterations . \r\rThe existing detached dwelling sits comfortably within a generous sized plot and is modern  both in terms of design and use of external finishes. Positioned on the existing northern elevation of the dwelling, the proposed side extension would be flush with the existing eastern elevation of the dwelling and  retract minimally  from the  existing from the building line of the western elevation.  It would present a flat roof arrangement accommodating 3no rooflights.\r\rIn addition to the above, the proposal  includes a number of changes to the  external appearance of the dwelling :\r -Proposed changes to the fenestration at  both ground and first floor levels  with  noted enlarged glazed openings on the west elevation at ground floor. \r- Existing grey timber frames to be replaced by grey metal frames\r- Introduction of a glass balustrade at first floor level on the south elevation;\r- Dual aspect pitch dormer roofs to be replaced by flat roofs,\r- Introduction of a chimney/ flue on roofslope on the western elevation\r- Stainless steel gutter and downpipes\r- Existing grey  timber cladding to be replaced by white render at ground floor and  grey metal cladding \r- Brown clay roof tiles to be replaced by grey metal cladding to match that proposed for the elevations of the dwelling. \r\rCollectively, Officers consider these  proposed changes to the external appearance of the dwelling, including the use of materials, to be appropriate and compliment the modern design of the dwelling.\r\rTherefore, within the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension together with the  changes to fenestration and external cladding, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Trees\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) states that the Council will expect new development  to ensure that trees are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided. \r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan (2021) states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained (Category A, B and lesser category trees where these are considered  by the local planning authority to be of importance to amenity and biodiversity,as defined by BS 5837:2012).\r\rThe site resides  within TPO Areas Order :MAC.06.56 Ref : A3 Area Order. RBK Tree and Landscape Officer has reviewed the proposal and has raised no objection. The Officer considered the  impacts to any trees on or off site are either none  at all or low impact.  \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 207 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rParagraph 216  states the effect of an application on the significance of a non designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining an application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset. \r\rThe site is located within the  Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non designated heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would  not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not harm the significance of the   Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks demolition of an existing garage, erection of single storey side and rear extension. Alteration to front porch\r\rSite\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposed side/rear extension will be 11m in depth overall and 3.1m in height with a flat roof. Although the extension is relatively deep, overall it will have modest height, scale and appropriate design and position. It would be in line with the main front elevation of the host property. It would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse. Further, there are existing examples of deep side/rear extensions on Rhodrons Avenue including no.40. The proposed front porch alteration is considered modest and appropriate in scale and design. \r\rOverall it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse. It is considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rIn terms of the impact on adjoining properties to its west and south, given the modest scale, appropriate design and position, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of these neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn terms of the impact no.2 Rhodrons Avenue, there are side openings facing towards the proposal. As they are secondary windows to the rooms and the proposed extension would pass 45 degree rule against the front and rear openings, it is not considered to adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light. There are no side openings proposed, therefore there will be no impact on overlooking.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy Statement. Officers are satisfied that the fire safety measures are appropriate and will not be adversely affected by the development and therefore it adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached 2 storey dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset) The area has a number of trees covering Telegraph Cottage and forms a distinct wooded character. The Majority of the trees are protected. Telegraph Cottage adjoins a golf course which is designated as Metropolitan Open Land. The surrounding properties are generally two storey and detached garages are characteristic of this development with examples at Nos. 1 and 3 and a large attached garage with living accommodation above at No. 4.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of an existing detached garage and erection of a single storey outbuilding for car parking space and use as 2 bed annexe with accommodation in roof space, ancillary to the main house.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Tree Officer : The impacts on the RPAs for the retaining trees to facilitate the development are minimal and will not be detrimental, so no objections. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact on Trees; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 202 to 214 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 209 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed garage would not be readily visible within the streetscene due to the existing boundary treatments. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the siting of the proposed development coupled with the generous plot size, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Should permission be granted a condition requiring ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house would be applied to ensure the annex cannot be used as an additional independent unit of accommodation.\r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rThe Council encourages the planting of native species. Where new tree species are to be introduced, a preference will be given to native species, where these native species represent the dominant character of the landscape (e.g. in proximity to a woodland setting) or disease/pollution resistant species, where proposed in close proximity to motorised traffic.\r\rThe Council discourages the planting of invasive or aggressive species, particularly where these species are proposed to be planted in close proximity to a neighbour's wall, fence or other structure. Large-canopied species are also discouraged.\r\rOfficer comment: As stated above, RBK Tree officer has reviewed the information provided and is satisfied no harm will come to trees on site as long as the methods described are followed. A condition requiring compliance with these reports would be applied should permission be granted.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
