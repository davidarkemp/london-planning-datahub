    "Prior to the preperation or cooking of any hot food, a scheme for the extraction and dispersal of all fumes and odours arising from the development (including details of its method of construction, odour control measures, noise levels, its appearance and its finish) shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority and then implemented in full. The measures which form the approved scheme shall be permanently retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development shall operate / be managed in accordance with the approved Management Plan May 2021 (includes opening hours)\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, and to ensure the proper planning of the area.",
    "The development hereby approved shall only be occupied / used / managed in accordance with the approved Flood Risk Assessment.\r\rReason: To prevent the patrons of the development from being exposed to the risks of flooding, in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Please provide elevations and other details of bin and cycle storage.",
    "All applications that involve extensions of 2 or more storeys, or where the resultant extension / development is above 2 storeys in height i.e. roof extension must provide \"25 Degree\" Elevation Plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the '25 degree rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r",
