    "The proposed extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises highway land. The highway authority is Transport for London and the development proposed would be a Transport for London development. The area is mixed in use. \r\rConsultation \r33 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 4 objections have been  received relating to:\r\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Noise\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use \r\rOfficers acknowledge the objections regarding noise, however, officers would not expect noise levels from a development of this scale to be unacceptable to neighbouring properties. All other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRBK Highways - No Comment; TFL route.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the replacement of two standard car parking with two electrical vehicle car parking, the applicant has submitted details showing two new EV charging units accompanied by Redipave Traffic Islands. Whilst officers acknowledge that these units would take up approximately 2m of the parking space, it would not require more than the loss of two standard parking spaces. Therefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHighways \rPara 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. Para 116 of the NPPF states that applications for development should inter alia be designed to enable charging of plug-in and other ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comments:  Officers acknowledge the concerns raised by objectors regarding the loss of parking and the potential impact on the vitality and viability of the parade. However, the proposal would support the policy at national, local and regional levels of supporting sustainable environmentally friendly travel, as the EV charging would assist with achieving the low carbon transition. Additionally, the introduction of 2no. EV charging points would allow for users of electric vehicles to benefit from visiting the parade.\r\rThe current parking restriction on-site limits car parking to park for an extended amount of time; cars are allowed to park for only 1 hour between 7am-7pm, this restriction optimises the use of the parade, as it would maintain a constant flow of customers. Overall, the proposed electrical charging point would not result in an unacceptable impact on highway safety or have a severe impact on the highway network.\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
