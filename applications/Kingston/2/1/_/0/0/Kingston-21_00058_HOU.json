    "The proposed two-storey front extension would unduly dominate the front elevation of the property and appear as an incongruous feature within the wider streetscene. The two-storey side aspect would not appear as a subservient feature to the original property and so result in an overly bulky addition to the property. The combined impact of both extensions would result in an overly-dominant form of development that would not reflect the scale and character of the original property and would have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Paragraph 127 of the NPPF (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant is informed that  the details required for Condition 5 (Construction Management Plan) of Planning Permission ref: 23/01707/FUL are hereby discharged, subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.\r",
    "Please provide Proposed Side Elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work."
