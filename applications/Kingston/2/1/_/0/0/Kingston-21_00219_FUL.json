    "The proposal would involve the unacceptable loss of a residential unit suitable for a family. The applicant has failed to robustly demonstrate that it would not be suitable or viable to provide a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3 or more bedroom units.  The proposal would not deliver a broad mix of units or units meeting an identified need. Accordingly the proposal would fail to contribute towards meeting the objectively assessed need within the Borough for 3 bedroom units and have an unacceptable effect on housing mix and conflict with Policy H10 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM13, DM14 & CS10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed dwellings would be of a good standard of accommodation with good levels of daylight and amenity space. No amenity space provision is made for Flats B & C. Accordingly the proposal would conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity for neighbouring residents by reason of loss of privacy to habitable rooms of No.s 88 & 90 Dickerage Road and have an overbearing impact on the residents of No.92 Dickerage Road. The proposal would therefore result in an unacceptable impact upon residential amenity and would conflict with the NPPF (2019), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and  policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

It is considered that the proposed amendment would be material within the context of what was approved and would require formal neighbour notification.\r\rThe application for a non-material amendment is therefore refused.",

    "Application Site: \r\rThe application relates to a three-storey detached property located on the southern side of Lime Grove. A two-storey flat roofed rear extension was added to the property in 2016. The property has been converted into 5 flats. The application relates to the top floor flat, being Flat 5. \r\rThe area is characterised by a mix of two and three-storey semi-detached, terraced and detached buildings and flatted developments.\r\rThe site is within the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character. The Groves Conservation Area is located approximately 20m south west of the site. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is for the conversion of the existing rear second floor flat roof into a roof terrace for Flat 5. \r\rRelevant History: \r\r21/03056/FUL: Application under Section 73A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission ref: 20/00967/FUL (Erection of a 2-storey building comprising 1 x self-contained. Granted 13.04.2022. \r\r21/02020/FUL: Conversion of existing rear second floor flat roof, into roof terrace for Flat 5. Granted 15.09.2021. \r\r20/00967/FUL: Erection of a 2-storey building comprising 1 x self-contained three bedroom residential dwelling with associated landscaping, car and cycle parking. Granted 06.11.2020. \r\r16/14106/FUL: Erection of two storey rear extension and extension of roof above, alterations to existing roof, addition of new windows and roof lights to provide extensions to existing flats. Granted 23.03.2016. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 11 neighbours were consulted and no response was received. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Character, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets:\r\rPara 135 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) (NPPF) encourages development to have an architectural style that is sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change. \r\rPara 216 of the NPPF states the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 (LP) states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rPolicy CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (CS) and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document 2013 (SPD) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposal is the resubmission of the planning permission granted on 15.09.2021 for a rooftop terrace (21/02020/FUL) which has now expired. The proposed terrace to the flat roof of the two-storey rear extension would have a depth of 5.7m and would have 1.7m high obscure glazed privacy screens around its perimeter. The proposed terrace would be set back by 1m from each side of the extension.\r\rThe site is within the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character (LASC). Whilst there are no other examples of high level terraces in the immediate area, they are generally commonplace in urban areas. The proposal relates to an existing flat roof and it is noted that those flats to the first floor on the rear elevation have similar obscure glazed screens in the form of Juliet balconies. The proposed external alterations would not detract from the appearance of the building or immediate surrounding area. Officers conclude there would be no harm to the significance of the LIme Grove LASC. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. CS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design Guide SPD states roof terraces on two-storey rear extension will not be accepted where they result in overlooking. \r\rThe proposal relates to Flat 5 which occupies the entirety of the second floor level. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure to nearby windows of habitable rooms. It is similarly acknowledged that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight in relation to neighbouring properties.\r\rIt is noted that Condition 4 of planning permission 16/14106/FUL specified that the flat roof of the extension could not be used as a sitting out area or balcony. However, this does not preclude an application for planning permission to allow such an amendment, which would be considered on its own merits.\r\rIt is acknowledged that roof terraces can often give rise to overlooking / loss of privacy. In this case, the terrace would be enclosed by a 1.7m high privacy screen, which would be set in by approximately 1m to all sides, which would prevent any undue loss of privacy. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity, in compliance with LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM10, and the Residential Design Guide SPD. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rNo Fire Statement has been submitted. Given the scope of the proposal is for a rooftop terrace with appropriate access, Officers consider the existing fire safety measures would be generally appropriate. A Fire Safety Strategy has been secured by condition to ensure compliance with LP Policy D12. \r\rConclusion:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. The proposed rooftop terrace and privacy screens would not detract from the character and appearance of the host building and would not result in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of neighbouring properties. The proposal is in compliance with LP Policy D3 and CS Policy CS8 and DM10. In conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
