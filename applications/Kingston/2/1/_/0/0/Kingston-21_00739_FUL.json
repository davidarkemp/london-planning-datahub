  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the introduction of an additional storey, would not be consistent with the description of the approved scheme and is considered not to constitute a minor material amendment in accordance with Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The proposed amendments, by reason of the introduction of an additional storey, the scale of that storey, and the introduction of an additional use to the building, would result in a development that would be substantially different from the one which has been approved and is considered not to constitute a minor material amendment in accordance with Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)",
    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 5 (C02 Emissions) of planning permission 22/03840/FUL.\r\rThe wording of Condition 8 (CO2 Emissions) of planning permission 22/03840/FUL.\r\rPrior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, evidence showing that the development has achieved at least a 19% improvement in CO2 emissions versus Part L of the Building Regulations and internal water usage rates of no greater than 105L per person per day have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation, in accordance with policy 5.2 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS1, DM3 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\rThe applicant has submitted a set of calculations to demonstrate a CO2 reduction in excess of 19% and details that show the internal water usage rates are no greater than 105 litres per per person per day. As such the submission detail would satisfy the requirements of the condition.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rRetention of  a single storey part rear flat roof canopy. (Retrospective)\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rRelevant planning history\r20/03220/HOU Erection of single storey side and rear extensions; conversion of existing garage into store room; erection of outbuilding to rear garden and proposed hip to gable roof and rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope - Granted on 07.06.2021\r\r21/03371/HOU Erection of first floor side extension - Granted on 04.01.2022\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal as described on the application form concerns an approximately 3.7m deep canopy with a solid flat roof to the rear extension (set along the boundary with No 35) approved under application ref 20/03220/HOU. The canopy roof is connected to the roof over the single storey rear extension (marked as 'store' on the submitted plans) set along the boundary  with No 41 with no planning history record. \r\rOfficers note the available planning history, building control and enforcement records for the application site.\r\rGiven no planning records for the existing extension set along the boundary with No 41, the relevant enforcement records, the Officers will assess the whole structure, which due to its excessive depth and siting is unlikely to fall under Class A of the permitted development rights.\r\rThe total depth of the existing single storey rear extensions and the proposed canopy structure would be approximately 6.7m from the original rear building line and the total height would be approximately 2.5m. The proposed depth of 6.7m is contrary to Policy Guidance 33 that recommends rear extensions up to 3.5 m deep. \r\rFurthermore,it is noted that the layout of the proposed ground floor plan would not ensure good quality accommodation, habitable rooms such as dining or kitchen which would receive an extremely limited amount of daylight. The proposed rear extension/structure would comprise an unusual combination of corridors, store and open areas. \r\rOfficers note the outbuilding to the rear of the garden. Considering the existing and proposed extensions/structures and the outbuilding, the rear garden area would be significantly reduced. \r\rIt is noted that the adjoining properties benefit from modest, approximately 3m rear extensions (No 41 planning permission 06/14548/FUL and No 35 planning permission 23/01546/HOU). The planning permission 20/03220/HOU granted a 3m deep rear extension for the application site.\r\rAs such, the proposed depth of the extension would not be in-keeping with the surrounding area.\r\rWith regards to the fenestration to the rear elevation, while it would not be visible with the existing street scene, it should still be of good quality and design, however the proposed rear elevation shows inconsistent and chaotic design.\r\rGiven the above, the overall mass and design as well as the depth of the existing extensions and the proposed structure of approximately 6.7m is considered to be not in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.  Furthermore, the proposed layout of the ground floor would not ensure an appropriate standard of accommodation in terms of daylight received in a habitable room (dining room). As such, the proposal is in conflict with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal given its modest height would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at the adjoining properties. \r\rAs both adjoining properties benefit from rear extensions, the proposal (also due to its height of approximately 2.5m) would not appear as an overbearing when viewed from the adjoining gardens. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy Report addressing the proposed canopy only. Further information is required to ensure that the whole development, the existing and proposed single storey structures would comply with Policy D12(A). \r\rThe Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022) where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide a full Proposed Roof Plan, i.e. showing the proposed dormer roof extension at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions of the proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. A scale bar is encouraged.",
    "All applications that involve extensions of 2 or more storeys, or where the resultant extension / development is above 2 storeys in height i.e. roof extension must provide \"25 Degree\" Elevation Plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the '25 degree rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r"
