    "The submitted ground floor plan is incomplete, it does not show the entire building.\rPlease revise Existing and Proposed Ground Floor Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North.",
