    "The proposed development is considered to fall within the criteria of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). No objections were received.",
    "Condition 5 of planning permission ref: 23/02552/FUL is as follows:\r\r'Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rThe Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.'\r\rOfficer Assessment: A document titled 'Fire Risk Assessment for UKFP Limited' dated 18.12.2023 has been submitted. It is noted that the submitted Assessment does not reference Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rThe submitted Assessment contains some fire safety information which is relevant to Condition 5 such as 'Recommended Actions' which include some passive and active fire safety measures. However, it is noted that there is no commitment within the submission for the recommended measures to be implemented. The submission is also lacking in detail of suitable means of escape/an evacuation strategy (for example the submission states that: 'At the time of the assessment a fire strategy wasn't available'). \r\rOverall, it has not been demonstrated how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety. The submission does not robustly address the requirements of Condition 5 and does not appear to have been produced with reference to the London Plan Guidance - Fire Safety or Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).\r\r",
