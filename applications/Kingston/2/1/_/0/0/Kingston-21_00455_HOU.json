    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rThe cycle parking facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained for that purpose and kept free from obstruction thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Application Site: \r\rThe application relates to a two-storey mid-terrace property located to the south-east of Moresby Avenue. The host property has a pitched roof with a 2-storey flat roofed side extension. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential, compromising 2-storey semi-detached properties. \r\rThe site is not located within a conservation area nor is it, or located nearby to, a statutory listed building and non-designated heritage asset. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is for the erection of pitched roof above the existing first floor extension and installation of 2nos. side rooflights. \r\rRelevant History: \r\r23/02608/HOU: Erection of roof extension to side, and rear dormer roof extension with Juliet balcony and installation of 3nos. front and 1no. side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Changes to first floor fenestration. Refused 14.11.2023. \r\r23/02609/CPU: Erection of single storey outbuilding to rear of garden. Granted 13.11.2023. \r\r23/01960/CPU: Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions (incorporating a juliet balcony) and installation of 3 no. rooflights to front rooslope. Granted 11.09.2023\r\r23/01961/PAEXT: Erection of single storey rear extension (4m in depth, maximum height of 3.3m and eaves height of 3m). Prior approval not required on 25.08.23.\r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 6 neighbours were consulted and 1 representation was received in objection. The objection raised the issue that the proposal has already been built despite planning permission not being granted. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Character and Design \r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Design: \r\rPara 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) (NPPF) states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rCS Policy CS8 and DM10 and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide SPD require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rCouncil's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) is relevant to the application. \r\rThe rear dormer roof extension was constructed in accordance with the lawful development certificate granted in 2023 (23/02609/CPU). The proposal would add a hipped end roof to the flat side extension which would have a roof ridge that sits 0.8m below the host property roof ridge. The symmetry of the semi-detached property has already been eroded by the two-storey flat roofed extension on the host property. There are a number of examples along Moreby Avenue with similar flat roofed side extensions and roof extensions that disrupt the symmetry of the pair of semi-detached properties, contrary to policy guidance under Section 4.29 of the Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document 2013 (SPD) (e.g. no. 14 and 33 Moresby Avenue). Officers consider the proposed roof extension would be acceptable in the context of the streetscape and would not further diminish the appearance of the local area in compliance with LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM8 and DM10. \r\rOfficers raise no concerns about the design of the rooflights given they are on a side roof slope and would not be visible from the streetscape. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. CS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal does not extend past the existing eaves of the host property therefore, would not impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties, in terms of overbearing enclosure, or loss of sunlight or privacy. The proposed rooflights are at an angle that would not result in a loss of privacy on neighbouring occupants. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rA Fire Safety Statement that confirms the proposal would provide suitable fire safety standards, in terms of materials and fire detection measures, in accordance with LP Policy D12. \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. The proposed development is considered to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. Officers recommend planning permission be granted.",
