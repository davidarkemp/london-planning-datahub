    "The proposed piggyback roof extension, by reason of its siting, would appear an incongruous addition to the existing dwelling, and would appear visually dominant in the streetscene, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "We received only one side elevation, we require both side (right and left) elevations.\rPlease provide all Existing and Proposed Side (Right and Left) Elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.",
    "Schedule 3, Clause 1.1 of the Legal Agreement (dated 10.11.2022) for planning permission 21/02740/FUL (appeal reference no. APP/Z5630/W/22/3301492) requires the submission of Final Energy Statement to be submitted to and approved by Council prior to the commencement of development. \r\rThe Applicant has submitted an Energy and Sustainability Strategy (prepared by ERS Consultants, dated 19/02/2025). The report confirms there would be a 72.07% reduction in CO2 emissions when compared against Part L of the 2021 Building Regulations. To meet the net-zero carbon requirement, a carbon offset contribution would be required for the shortfall of 5.809 tonnes per annum of regulated CO2. This is equivalent to 174.27 tonnes over 30 years requiring a carbon offset contribution of  £16,555.65 at the carbon offset price of £95 per tonne of CO2. \r\rThis is a substantial improvement in carbon emission savings compared to the original scheme whereby the Energy and Sustainability Strategy (prepared by XCO2, dated August 2021) set out the scheme would result in a 42.9% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to Part L of the 2013 Building Regulations and a carbon offset contribution of 13.7 tonnes per annum of regulated CO2. The substantial difference in savings is likely due to a difference in the baseline figures and assessment procedures derived from the 2021 Buildings Regulations compared to the 2013 Building Regulations. \r\rThe submitted material complies with the requirements of Schedule 3, Clause 1.1 of the Legal Agreement. As such, the obligation has been discharged. \r\rIt is noted that the obligations under Schedule 3, Clause 1.3 of the Legal Agreement have not been discharged and still requires the payment of the carbon off-set fund contribution to Council."
