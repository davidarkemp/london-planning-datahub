    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area, Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and 2.5 Coombe Hill Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rThe site is covered by a TPO group order.\r\rProposal \rReplacement of white painted timber fascia and soffits with white UPVC fascia and soffits and white replacement upvc guttering and downpipes. Erection of BBQ structure to rear.\r\rRepresentations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal.\r\rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Fumes & Storage of hazardous substances in relation to a BBQ structure\r- no sufficient details for a BBq structure\r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be included in this assessment. \r\rConsultations\rMaldens And Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - objects: \r\rAlthough this house is modern, it lies within the Conservation Area and the doors and windows were originally constructed using timber. The proposed materials should match the existing ones, rather than using uPVC, which we believe would have a detrimental effect.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Southborough Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on protected trees.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe applicant proposes replacement of white painted timber fascia and soffits with white UPVC fascia and soffits and white replacement upvc guttering and downpipes. \r\rOfficers note high quality materials and design of the existing dwelling, the timber fenestration, fascia and soffits as well as mock Tudor details.\r\rThe dwelling (especially the roof details) due to its siting would be directly visible with the existing street scene and the conservation area.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed UPVc panels for fascias and soffits would be in contrast with the high quality of the existing timber details. Based on the submitted, limited information this element of the proposal does not appear to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the host dwelling and therefore, the Coombe Hill Conservation Area, Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rIt should be noted that the UPVc panels would weather and its deteriorating quality would be in contrast to mock Tudor bars and other timber details. \r\rAs such it is considered that this element of the proposal would result in an unacceptable, material change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rWith regards to the proposed guttering and downpipes, this is considered to be acceptable. \r\rOffices note the proposed door and side panels, due to limited information it is unclear how this would affect the existing door surrounds and sash side windows, such a modern and contrasting design may not be in-keeping with the Tudor style dwelling. \r\rWhile the proposed height and materials for the BBQ structure to the rear may be acceptable, insufficient details have been provided with regards to its location to conclude that this element of the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as the special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: The estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but given the high quality materials and design it contributes positively to the conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, Officers conclude that the proposed UPVc fascia and soffits  would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling, the Coombe Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, they would fail to preserve or enhance their character and appearance. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns received with the written representations regarding lack of details for the proposed BBQ structure, especially with regards to its location and if any raised platforms are being proposed. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed structure would not adversely impact the neighbouring properties in terms of an undue overlooking or loss of privacy. \r\rA BBQ structure on domestic premises is not expected to create an unacceptable level of pollution (fumes). \r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers note the submitted Arboricultural Impact Assessment Plan that was also submitted for the recently approved application no 23/03249/HOU. \r\rAs the location of the proposed BBQ structure was not indicated, it is unclear how that would impact the protected trees. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
