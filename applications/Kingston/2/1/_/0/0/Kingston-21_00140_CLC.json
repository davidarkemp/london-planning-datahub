    "Due to insufficient information submitted for Condition 19 (Sustainable Drainage Strategy) of planning permission 20/02540/FUL the proposal fails to meet the drainage hierarchy, set in place to prevent the development from increasing risk of flooding to the site thereby conflicting with Policy 5.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted (2012).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing detached garage, erection of two storey side, part two storey/part single storey rear and single storey front porch extensions.\r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. 1 neutral  representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Construction working hours should be introduced\r- The proposal may encroach onto the adjoining property\r\rOfficer response: The above comments will be included with this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Highways; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side extension would be finished in flat roof which would not relate well to the existing roof form, it is also noted that the proposed eaves height would exceed the existing eaves height of the host dwelling. However, Officers note the existing street scene contains many examples of similar two storey side extensions with flat roof (for example Nos 18, 20 or 36 Rollesby Road or dwellings on Ashby Avenue). \r\rWith regards to the proposed porch, given its scale and design it is considered to be in keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed part single part two storey rear extension, due to its excessive width in connection with the proposed flat roof form would appear as disproportionate, dominant and incongruous addition that would not be in keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy Guidance 34 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rOfficers note comments received within the written representations about the proposal encroaching onto adjoining properties, however the submitted plans suggest that the proposal would be within the application red boundary line. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule with regards to the habitable openings at the ground and first floor levels in the rear elevation at No 46 Rollesby Road. \r\rIt would also pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the habitable openings at the rear elevation at No 42. \r\rTherefore, the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the adjoining properties. \r\rGiven the irregular shape of the site plot, the proposed depth of the rear extension in relation to the siting of the adjoining properties, it is considered that the proposal would not appear as an overbearing when viewed from from the rear gardens of the adjoining properties. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
