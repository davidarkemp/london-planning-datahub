    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rThe Royal Parks (TRP)  -  pleased to note a 'Preliminary Roost Assessment' taken place. Noted plans do not include any proposal for exterior lighting, however, if these are proposed they would need to be controlled under condition by planners to avoid impacting the park and its wildlife.  \r\rLondon Borough of Richmond Upon Thames - no objection \r\rKingston and North Kingston Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - lack of detail. We do not have concerns about the alterations proposed  to the rear of the property. However, the applicant wishes to replace the 'barge boards etcs' to the front of the property as well as the fenestration to 'match the style of the existing generally. The application does not specify the new 'barge boards etc' or the new double glazed fenestration & therefore without this information including product samples there is a material risk that these alterations could cause harm to the character and appearance of the property and surrounding CA. \r\rRBK Biodiversity Officer - comments provided in the report.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  minor landscape works to the front of the property, new timber windows, external decoration works and new glazed balustrade to rear balcony, alteration to fenestrations, Erection of gate. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rThe  application site resides within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area  (designated heritage asset) which is  characterised by large two storey semi detached and detached  individually  designed  houses of special character with dwarf walls dating from the 1850's set with mature landscapes. \r\rThe site also resides in Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (non designated heritage asset)  and tier 2 archaeological priority area.\r\rPlanning History\r24/03015/CLC - Details required for Condition 5 (Detailed drawing) and Condition 6 (Detailed Design with Method Statement) of planning permission 24/02349/HOU (Changes to fenestrations to ground floor rear of property.

Refused 23.09.66\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Biodiversity \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval of minor landscape works to front of property, new timber windows, external decoration works and new glazed balustrade to rear balcony, alteration to fenestrations. Erection of gate. \r\rRear Elevation \rThe dwelling has the benefit of an existing planning permission relating solely to change of fenestration at ground floor level  (planning ref : 24/02349/HOU, granted 22.11.24). These proposed works are included as part of this application.\r\rThe existing fenestration arrangement at ground floor level comprises a single glazed in fill panel, a pair of french doors with a fanlight above and a large timber framed sash window. The remaining windows at lower ground, ground, first and second floors consist of existing timber sash windows of varying quality. \r\rAt ground floor level, the proposal seeks to replace the existing  timber single glazed in fill panel door with a double glazed/ thermally efficient timber sash window to match existing style windows on the rear elevation. It would not be in the same position as the existing  single door occupying a larger opening on the rear elevation.  \r \rThe existing  timber single glazed in fill panel with a fixed light over  and the kitchen single glazed sash window  would be replaced by 4no double glazed/ thermally efficient timber doors with double glazed fixed light above. These would be in a similar height and position as existing.  In order to accommodate the proposed new timber framed doors, Officers note there would be a requirement for  the demolition of a section of the rear elevation wall i.e. the exterior wall between the existing rear windows  as  well as the lower section of the rear wall  to create the appropriate size opening.  From a structural engineering perspective, it would be expected that a reinforcing load bearing supporting beam would need to be introduced to achieve the installation.  No details have been provided  and should Officers be minded to grant approval further details are likely to be requested by way of a planning condition for Local Planning Authority's approval. In addition, Officers would also recommend that the demolition material  extracted from the rear elevation be retained  for reuse for any future planning application where alterations are required to the external appearance of the dwelling.\r\rWith regards to  the relationship between the dwelling and the Royal Park, it is considered that the long distance view of the rear elevation  would be obscured  by way of the existing dense vegetation combined with the depth of the rear garden. Impact would therefore be negligible.\r\rOfficers note that the inclusion of a larger scale window  and a set of 4no doors on the rear elevation would change the overall proportionality and appearance of the rear elevation of the host dwelling. However, as the proposed changes are at the rear of the dwelling and therefore  would not  be visible from the streetscene, it is considered that the proposal is unlikely to have a detrimental harmful impact on the character or appearance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area. \r\rWith regards to the replacement of remaining existing timber sash windows  with thermally efficient double glazed timber sash windows and the replacement of the existing metal balustrade with toughened glass balustrade, these proposed works would not be visible from  the streetscene. It is therefore considered that these elements of the  proposal  are unlikely to have a detrimental harmful impact on the character or appearance of Liverpool Road Conservation Area.  Should Officers be minded to grant approval for the replacement windows,  further details are likely to be requested by way of a planning condition for Local Authority's approval in terms of the dimensions, materials and thermal efficiency. In addition, where the replacement windows are to serve bathrooms, an appropriate planning condition would be attached to the permission  stipulating for the glazing to be obscured. \r\rTo conclude, it is considered that the overall proposed works to be implemented to the rear elevation of the dwelling are  unlikely to have a detrimental harmful impact on the character or appearance  of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area.  \r\rFront Elevation \rIn relation to the front elevation of the dwelling, the application seeks approval for the following proposed works :\r\r- the replacement of the existing timber sash windows on the lower ground, ground, first and second floors with double glazed / thermally efficient sash windows to match the existing style\r- the replacement of the existing garage doors with new timber doors \r- introduction of a sliding gate across the driveway  and a pedestrian gate  to be constructed in the same style as the existing railings.  \r\rOfficers also note the proposals include the removal of redundant pipework  and redecoration of existing pipework or where necessary replacement with new in a style to match existing.  The applicant is advised that the replacement of pipework  in a style to match existing can be undertaken under permitted development rights, however the introduction of new  and separate pipework would be the subject of a new planning application.\r\rWhilst the proposals as set out above on the front elevation would be visible from the streetscene, it is considered  that it is unlikely that the proposals,  either individually or collectively, would  have a detrimental harmful impact on the character or appearance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area.\r\rBargeboards\rWhilst the application makes reference  to the elevations to be redecorated  with new barge boards in order to tidy the external appearance, it is understood these  would essentially comprise replacement of existing  soffit boards  rather than the installation of the traditional   decorative barge boards which can be found on period properties in RBK.  \r\rOverall conclusion \rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the  design and use of materials for the proposed fenestration, replacement windows, glazed balustrade, timber garage doors and  sliding gate to driveway and pedestrian  gate, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets  \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 207 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe site is located within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area, a designated heritage asset and  Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non designated heritage asset.\r\rRear elevation\rThe introduction of the new fenestration at ground floor level would result in a change in the proportionality  and therefore the  appearance of the  overall rear elevation, however, such changes would not be visible from the streetscene. In respect of the replacement of the existing timber framed windows with new timber frame double glazed windows,  there would be no enlargement of the existing window openings and therefore on that basis it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of the character and appearance  of the host dwelling. In terms of the replacement of the existing balcony metal balustrade with a toughened glass balustrade, it is considered this proposed change  particularly in terms of the use of  glass allowing transparency  and enhanced visibility of the dwelling,  would have a negligible impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling.  \r\rTherefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area as a designated heritage  nor upon the non designated heritage assets of Strategic Area of Special Character as a result of the proposed changes to the rear elevation.\r\rFront Elevation \rWith regard to the replacement of the existing timber framed windows with new timber frame double glazed windows on all floor levels, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of the character and appearance  of the host dwelling as a result of the proposals. In respect of  new timber garage doors, sliding gate across the driveway entrance  and pedestrian gate  the principle is acceptable and it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of the character and appearance of the host dwelling and its setting.\r\rTherefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area as a designated heritage  nor upon the non designated heritage assets of Strategic Area of Special Character as a result of the proposed changes to the rear elevation.\r\rConclusion \rOverall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of Liverpool Road Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any harm against any public benefits of the proposal.\r\rBiodiversity \rParagraphs 187 - 195 in the NPPF (2024)  addresses conserving and enhancing the natural environment.  Paragraph 193  sets out the principles that Local Planning Authorities should apply when determining planning applications. \r\rPolicy G6 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net diversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process. Policy DM6 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echoes these principles. \r\rThe application site is located within 50m of Richmond Park, a Grade 1 listed on Historic England's Register of Historic Parks and Gardens and is a National Nature Reserve (NNR), a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) , Conservation Area and a Special Area of Conservation (SAC).  \r\rA Preliminary Bat Roost Assessment  and Bat Emergence Survey  both prepared by  ProHort  have been submitted in support of the application and have been reviewed by RBK Biodiversity Officer.\r\rOfficers note daytime inspections of the exterior and interior of the building were carried out to identify any Bat Roost Features. Damaged tiles and soffits were recorded supporting the  prospect of foraging and commuting bats. On this basis,the Bat Roost Potential of the building was assessed as being Moderate. \r\rThree emergence Bat surveys were carried out following BCT guidance 4th Edition. Common pipistrelles bats  were recorded emerging and reemerging from the soffit and along the roof edge on the northern aspect of B1, and Soprano Pipistrelles recorded emerging from along the roof edge of the northern aspect of B1. \r\rAs stated in 2.0 of the emergence survey report, all bat species are afforded protection under Schedule 5 of the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 and Regulation 43 of the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations 2017. Making it an offence to disturb, damage or destroy a breeding site or resting place of a bat (bats do not have to be in occupation at the time).\r\rThe proposal includes the replacement of the existing soffits (bargeboards) which may result in the disturbance  of the bat roost.   Within the report Officers note reference to  a proposed new roof structure within the garden room - this does not form part of  the proposed works being determined for  this application  \r\rIn the context of the above, Paragraph 11.3  in the Emergence Survey recommends that any contractors working on the dwelling must be briefed about the possible presence of bats and the need to stop work if Bats are found and to seek advice from a suitably qualified person about how best to proceed.  Whilst reference to a mitigation plan is recommended, no details have been provided should it be required to be implemented.\r\rThe paragraph continues  by recommending that the works should be overseen by a suitably qualified bat worker under NRW Bat licence. RBK Biodiversity Officer recommends  that if there is a risk of destruction  or disturbance to the roost the applicant would need to secure a European Protected Species Licence  or bat' low impact' licence (CL21) from Natural England.  \r\rOn this basis,   should Officers be minded to approve the planning application RBK Biodiversity Officer has recommended a pre commencement planning condition be included on the planning permission requiring   the ecologist to provide details  which clearly set out and demonstrate proactive measures to be implemented  to avoid disturbance and/or destruction of  a multi species  roost in accordance  with the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981. These details would need to be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority .   Alternatively to the pre commencement condition,  the applicant would need to apply for   and secure a European Protected Species Licence  or  bat 'low impact licence' (CL21) from Natural England  and upon receipt submit a copy to RBK Development Management for the planning records.  \r  \rOfficers also acknowledge the Emergence Survey recommends the installation of two  artificial bat boxes  at the property or nearby. In respect of the potential presence of bats within the  vicinity of the Site, Officers would recommend by way of a planning condition the installation of a minimum of one integrated bat box  at the property or nearby to provide  roosting opportunities . These are to be installed away from windows and artificial light sources.  With regard to operation lighting post development, Officers would endorse that  external lighting  should be kept to a minimum  and follow the guidance  from the Bat Conservation Trust ' Bats and artificial lighting at Night ' (2023).  In the event of an approval, Officers would recommend external lighting be subject to a planning condition. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBiodiversity\rIn the knowledge there is an active  multi species bat roost at 21 Liverpool Road, Kingston Upon Thames, KT2 7SX as evidenced in  the submitted Emergence Bat Survey dated October 2024 prepared by Prohort, the  proposed works to the  dwelling  should be overseen by a suitably qualified bat worker under NRW Bat license. If there is a risk of destruction  or disturbance to the roost, the applicant would need to secure a European Protected Species Licence  or bat' low impact' licence (CL21) from Natural England.  \r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r\r\r",
