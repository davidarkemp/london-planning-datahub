    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of, would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019).\r\r\r",
    "Please provide Proposed Roof Plan at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions of the proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North."
