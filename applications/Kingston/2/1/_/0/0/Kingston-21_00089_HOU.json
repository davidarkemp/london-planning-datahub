    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 33 and Policy Guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of its lack of set-back from the front elevation and the excessive depth of 6m beyond the rear elevation and would fail to be a proportionate addition to the existing dwelling which would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\r",
    "The excessive depth and height of the proposed extension along the boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining No. 44 which would be at odds with the suburban character of the area. The proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of adjoining No. 44 Warren Drive, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant should note that the quality of information provided is not satisfactory due to the following reasons:\r- Heritage statement does not describe significance of Park Road conservation area, following NPPF; does not adequately analyse existing building and materials.\r- Drawings lack detail.\r- No reference to Park Road conservation area appraisal.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling located within the Park Road Conservation Area.\r\rProposal \rReplacement of roof and changes to front and rear fenestration\r\rConsultations\rKingston and North Kingston Neighbourhood Conservation Areas advisory Committee - objects to the proposed materials - UPVc fenestration\r\rRBK's Hertiage Officer - objects (please see below)\r\rRepresentations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and its  impact on the Park Road Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance and Heritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site is located within the Park Road Conservation Area.\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as an area of fine Victorian houses and local shops dating from 1890 -1900.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless, due to high quality of the existing materials,  contributes positively to the conservation area.\r\rExtract from Park Road conservation area appraisal:\r\"Orchard Cottages, built in 1893/4, is a quiet backwater entirely hidden from Clifton Road, and tucked in next to the railway embankment. The tightly enclosed footpath approach emphasises the contrast in scale between this terrace and the rest of the area. A plain stock-brick terrace, it gains much of its pleasant informal character from its car-free location and picket-fenced front gardens. Since the houses are plain, their windows and doors are their most important features, which means that the many changes to PVCu, inappropriate small-paned bay designs, or infills of the inset porches have a disproportionate effect, as does the painting of the brickwork at no.6. But two properties - nos. 2 and 4 - retain their early form of windows (sashes without horns), and these are valuable survivals.\"\r\rOfficers note comments received from the conservation Area Advisory Committee objecting to the proposed use of UPVc fenestration for developments situated within a conservation area and that are clearly visible from the public realm.  \r\rThe Council's Heritage Officer is not able to support the proposal and has concluded that the proposed changes would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the conservation area, through inappropriate alterations. They would not preserve or enhance the appearance of the conservation area. The Officer's comments:\r\r1. 'The wholesale replacement of the existing roof slates with spanish slates is not supported. It is not stated what type of slate is existing, but it is assumed that they are original; spanish slates will change the appearance of the roof. It is unlikely that all of the slates will have reached their end-of-life, and any individual broken slates should be replaced like-for-like as required.\r\r2. The replacement velux window should be 'conservation style', flush with the roof.\r\r3. While the existing windows to the front elevation are non-original, the replacement with PVC windows is not supported. Any replacement should be of timber sash, to match the original sash windows of neighbours and those to the rear elevation (N.B. the CA appraisal states that these are of an early sash design without horns). The glazing could be slimline double glazing or vacuum glazing in order to retain the traditional appearance, while improving thermal properties. It is agreed that these should be recessed into the facade, to show a brick reveal.\r\r4. While the front ground floor bay is non-original, the pairing of two sash windows next to each other to fill the gap is awkward. The opening should be filled in with brick to return back to a single window, or a single multi-paned window designed to fill the gap.\r\r4. The replacement of the existing first floor window to the rear elevation is not supported, as this is original. Secondary glazing can be installed to improve energy efficiency and thermal comfort; or if the glazing is non-historic, it can be replaced with slimline double glazing or vacuum glazing in the original frames.\r\r5. The existing ground floor window to the rear can be replaced with a door, but this should be in a traditional format, with timber frames and slimline double glazing or vacuum glazing.\r\r6. The existing window to the non-original rear extension can be replaced with bi-folding doors, but further detail is needed.'\r\rOverall, while Officers raise no objection to replacement of the non-original bay window, the replacement  window due to its design (as per the above comments) and the proposed material is not acceptable. Given the description of significance of the area and cottages at the beginning of this section, the proposed use of UPVc instead of timber windows would have a detrimental impact on the host dwelling and the adjoining cottages, resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the area. \r\rFurthermore, based on limited information submitted for the proposed roof slates, it has not been demonstrated that it would be of an adequate quality, it is also unclear why the existing slates need to be replaced and if alternative options (repair) were considered. \r\rAny proposed rooflights in a conservation area must be of a conservation style and flush with the roof. \r\rWhile the proposed replacement of the original rear window with a door may be acceptable in principle, the proposed door due to its design is not considered to be appropriate in this case. \r\rAs such, the proposed alterations due to the proposed design and the proposed materials   would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the  Park Road Conservation Area, which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "All applications that involve extensions must provide \"45 Degree\" floor and elevation plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the 45 degree 'rule'.
