  "description": "Demolition of existing single storey rear extension and erection of a new single storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii)  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing rear extension and erection of a single storey side/rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would project approximately 1.7m beyond the original rear building line of the host dwelling and the adjoining, semi detached property. Given the proposed design and scale, the modest eaves height of approximately 2.7m and the separation distance to the common boundary of approximately 0.7m, the proposal is considered to appear as a subordinate addition to the host dwelling. The proposed mass and bulk is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension due to its scale and siting would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at the adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
