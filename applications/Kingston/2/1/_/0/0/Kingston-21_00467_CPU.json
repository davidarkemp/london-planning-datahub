  "description": "Hip to gable roof extension, rear dormer extension with Juliet Balcony and installtion of 3no.x front rooflighst to facilitate loft conversion.(TBC)",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "It has not been demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that the cubic content of the resulting roof space of the proposed roof extensions would not exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. Therefore the proposed development would fail to comply with paragraph B1.(d) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "All applications that involve extensions of 2 or more storeys, or where the resultant extension / development is above 2 storeys in height i.e. roof extension must provide \"25 Degree\" Elevation Plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the '25 degree rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r",
    "Under Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rProposal:\rOn 24 February 2017 planning permission was granted for the following development:\rDemolition of all existing buildings (save for the listed building) at 18-20 Borough Road, and redevelopment to provide 11 houses, 3 flats (within the listed building) and 585sqm of employment floor space together with 16 parking spaces 16/12324/FUL).\r\rCondition 18 attached to this planning permission states:\rThe car parking spaces identified Nos. 1-12 on the approved drawings shall be reserved for car parking by occupiers of the dwellings hereby permitted and their visitors and for no other purpose; the four car parking spaces identified A-D on the approved drawings shall be reserved for car parking by occupiers of the commercial building hereby permitted and their visitors and for no other purposes.\r\rCondition 18  reserved four car parking spaces identified A-D on the approved Proposed Site Ground Floor Plan (dwg ref. P_101 Rev 4) for the commercial building, which is now referred to as Highwood House.\r\rIt is advised that Parking space (D) has subsequently been assigned to an occupier of a dwelling approved under planning permission 16/12324/FUL.\r\rOn 29 August 2024, an application was submitted to the Council for prior notification to change the use of part of Highwood House from Use Class E to five dwellings (Class C3) (LPA ref 24/02138/PAMA.). Floor space at ground floor level\rto be retained for part commercial (Class E) use. This application also sought  to reserve one of the three available car parking\rspaces for the retained commercial use at ground floor level, and two of the three car parking spaces for the residential use as proposed. Prior Approval was refused.\r\rIt is considered that the amendment goes beyond the scope of a non-material alteration, as it would affect the operative part of the permission and  potentially detract from the viability  and use of the commercial floor space approved under application 16/12324/FUL.  As such, the proposed amendment to the wording of condition 18  would be a material change and not covered under the provisions of Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers are not satisfied that the proposed amendments are non-material and recommend that the application be refused."
