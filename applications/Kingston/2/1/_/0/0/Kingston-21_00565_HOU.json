  "decision_conditions": [
    "Due to the excessive height of the proposed boundary fence it would appear out of keeping with the other boundary fences on both Walpole Road and Upper Brighton Road, resulting in an incongruous feature within the streetscene causing significant harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policies CS8 & DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (adopted 2012) and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Inconsistent Plans - the Proposed First Floor Plan shows 2 windows along the North West Elevation, but the Proposed North West Elevation shows only 1 window. Please check the plans and amend where necessary.",
    "The applicant is reminded that the development approved under prior approval ref: 21/02810/PRA must have been completed by 30th September 2024. If the development has not been completed by this date then the prior approval will have expired and a new application would be required."
