    "Due to its excessive size and choice of colour and materials the proposed cycle storage/shed would appear incongruous and jarring in appearance from the street and in relation to the original dwelling, adjoining property, No. 193 Richmond Road, and the wider area. The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraph 196 of the NPPF (2019), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Inconsistent plans - the recently submitted plans still show an inconsistency between elevation and floor plans. The Proposed Side Elevation shows 1 side window at first floor, but 2 side windows are shown on the Proposed First Floor Plan. Please check and amend plans."
