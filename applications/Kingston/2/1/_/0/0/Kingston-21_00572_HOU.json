  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the single storey rear extension, would respond poorly to its surroundings and would appear disproportionate, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the single storey rear extension, would result in a set of overbearing structures that would unduly enclose Nos. 69 and 73 Sanger Avenue and deprive the occupants of these properties of a reasonable outlook, resulting in unacceptable living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The submitted Existing and Proposed Sections do not have a scale bar. Please revise the Existing and Proposed section with a correct scale bar.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Erection of hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front rooflights.'",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\r5 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 207 to 221 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 216 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and therefore, no adverse impacts on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regards to neighbouring amenity the principal properties to consider are No. 179 and No. 175 Tudor Drive.  The proposed single storey rear extension would be build hard up on the boundary of No. 179 Tudor drive and would be 3.5m in depth with a flat roof 3m in height. The plans submitted show that this extension would breech the 45 degree rule under BRE guidance in both elevation and plan, resulting in a loss of daylight/sunlight to the nearst habitable room window of No. 179 Tudor Drive. BRE Guidance states that one of these measurements can be breached but not both.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light. No harm to No. 175 Tudor Drive was identified.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear/side wraparound and front porch extensions. Alterations to replace first floor flat roof with sloped roof, installation of heat pump to rear, internal alterations and all associated works\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings (eaves height should be 3m and not 3.33m)\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as building regulations, soundproofing or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment. Any other concerns will be addressed within this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front extension and alterations to the front elevations, given the proposed design, siting and scale are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the existing street scene. \rThe proposed roof to the existing first floor side extension is considered to improve the appearance of the dwelling; the slight increase in roof eaves, although not ideal, is considered to be acceptable in this case. \r\rOfficers note the written concerns regarding the proposed scale and height of the wraparound extension. The proposed parapet roof would be approximately 3.3m high, in accordance with the Policy Guidance 33. Given the siting of the proposal and its scale, it is considered that the proposed wraparound extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would pass the 45 degree rule and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the adjoining property, No 71. Given the proposed depth of approximately 3.5m and height, it is not considered to appear as an overbearing when viewed from No 71. \r\rWith regards to the adjoining property No 75, the proposal due to its scale and siting, would not adversely affect the primary habitable openings at this property. \r\rThe proposed installation of the heat pump, given it siting is considered to be acceptable, a relevant condition would be attached to ensure adequate noise levels. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rHighway Safety \rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed conversion of garage into a storage/garage space would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network as  the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space. Officers note no parking restrictions on Highdown.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space or the converted garage/storage space.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
