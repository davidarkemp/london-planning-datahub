  "description": "Erection of rear L-shaped dormer roof extension and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed rear dormer extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be a dominant and overbearing feature that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and be visually intrusive in the rear of views of the site from the neighbouring surrounding properties to the detriment of the character and appearance of the wider area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of teh Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Inspection: Site inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\rAssessment: The works proposed are acceptable. \rRecommendation: Approve tree surgery work.\r",
    "Please provide the schedule of works to the trees within the application boundary and any which will be affected outside of the site boundary (if any). We are unable to make the application valid until this has been provided."
