    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and roof design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling, would unduly erode the gap to No. 8 Tudor Drive resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The fee required for your planning application is Â£2,730.  Payment can be made online via the Kingston council website, or via our Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002.",
    "The onus rests with the applicant to provide evidence of exactly what proposal is being applied with sufficient clarity and precision on the submitted plans to enable the local planning authority to understand exactly what is involved (in line with NPPG para ref: 17c-005-20140306 and 17c-006-20140306).\r"
