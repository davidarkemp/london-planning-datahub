    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling, would unduly erode the gap to 18 Beechcroft Road, and would appear as an incongruous feature within the Beechcroft Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Condition 18 (vehicular crossover) - Condition 18 requires that Prior to commencement, the applicant shall submit a vehicular crossover application to the local highways department for approval in writing. No evidence that this has been applied for has been submitted. Approval of this condition is therefore refused",
    "We have received the email to change the agent's details and agent is no longer acting on behalf of the application, therefore please amend the whole application form with correct contact details of the new agent and other information.\r\rPlease submit new application form with new agent's details."
