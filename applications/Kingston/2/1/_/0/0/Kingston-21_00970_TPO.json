Under the provisions of sections 206 and 213 of the Act, the owner of the land upon which the above tree(s) are to be removed is under a duty to plant one replacement tree of appropriate size and species, per tree under TPO removed according to the above list. These should be planted as close to the original tree(s) as possible unless otherwise agreed with the Council's Tree Officer. The replacement trees should be planted within the first planting season (Oct 1st - April 30th) following the proposed removals.\n\n2. The size of the tree shall be a standard with a height of 2.50 metres, a minimum stem height of 1.75 metres and a girth of 8cm to 10cm to conform with BS 3936 Part 1 (1992).\n\n3. Any replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st to April 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\n\nAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\n\nThe following will be suitable replacement species:\n\n(a) Purple Birch (Betula pendula 'Purpurea') as replacement for T.2.\n(b) Paper Birch (Betula papyrifera) as replacement for T.1\n\nI have to warn you that if one of the above specified replacements is not planted by the end of the first planting season (Oct 1st to April 30th) following the proposed removals, a notice may be served under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). However, I trust that such action will not be necessary and I look forward to receiving your full cooperation in this matter.

    "Officer Report\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area, Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and 2.5 Coombe Hill Area of Archaeological Significance.\n\nThe site is covered by a TPO group order.\n\nProposal \nErection of an external covered BBQ Area (Retrospective)\n\nRepresentations \n4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations have been received \n\nConsultations\nMaldens and Coombe Conservation area Advisory Committee - no objections\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development;\n- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets;\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n-Trees;\n- Fire Safety. \n\nCharacter and Appearance\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: The current application relates to the application ref 24/02054/HOU for 'Replacement of existing timber front door and side lights with composite door and side lights. Erection of covered BBQ area to rear.' refused on 08.11.2024 due to the adverse impact of the proposed front door on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Officers raised no injections to the proposed BBQ area.\n\nThe proposed BBQ area as per submitted plans is the same in terms of scale, materials and siting as the one assessed for the previous scheme ref 24/02054/HOU. \n\nGiven the proposed design, materials and its siting that will not be visible with the existing street scene, the proposal is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\n\nHeritage Assets\nSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \nIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \n                                                                                                              \nParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \n                                           \nPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\n\nParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\n\nOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as the special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: The estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course.\n\nThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but given the high quality materials and design it contributes positively to the conservation area. \n\nHaving regard to the above, Officers conclude that the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling, the Coombe Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Heritage Assets.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting, the existing greenery along the common boundary with No 149 and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nProtected Trees\nThe proposal, given its scale and siting, would not adversely affect the protected trees.\nIt is noted that the Tree Officer raised no objections to the arboricultural information submitted for the previous application ref 24/02054/HOU, the current BBQ area and the arboricultural information are identical to the previous scheme. \n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n"
