    "The proposed development, by reason of its additional height and close proximity to neighbouring properties will appear as a cramped form of development that will have an adverse impact on the amenity of the neighbours through overlooking and further enclosing a communal entrance space, to the detriment of the enjoyment of these properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraphs 124 and 127 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent. This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
