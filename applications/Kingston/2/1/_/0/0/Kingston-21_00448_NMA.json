    "The Council considers the amendments to be non-material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment be granted.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached bungalow.. \r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals; 1 objection has been received relating to:\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r\rConcerns regarding Party Wall Agreements and boundary disputes between neighbours and other disputes, such as maintenance are considered civil matters. Officers also acknowledge the concerns raised regarding future solar panels to a neighbouring property, however, officers can not take into account theoretical solar panels when considering this application. \r\rAll other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below\r\rDevelopment Description\rErection of single storey rear extension on ground floor level, erection of new storey to create a new floor and replacement roof incorporating rooflights and bay window(s) to front elevation. Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with juliet balcony to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed site has an existing bungalow that currently has 1 bedroom, a lounge, a bathroom and a kitchen/dinner. The proposal involves the addition of two levels which would include a total of 4 bedrooms, a kitchen/dinner, and 3 bathroom/shower rooms.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge that Albermarle Gardens has a variety of dwelling designs and heights and the proposed first and second-floor extensions to create a two-storey dwelling would have a height that would match adjoining semi-detached No.37 Albemarle Gardens. However, the proposed addition of two floor levels including the double gable ends would appear very prominent in the streetscene, due to its height and bulky appearance.\r\rOfficers note the architectural detailing of the dwellings in Albemarle Gardens is a prominent feature in the immediate vicinity, it appears that the applicant aims to establish similarities with these dwellings by incorporating the two-storey bay window. The submitted drawings do not show consistency regarding the two-storey bay window, furthermore, the proposed two-storey bay window lacks architectural detailing which would capture the resemblance of neighbouring properties sufficiently. The proposals would be a poor quality facsimile of neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed dormer extension would not be set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm or be set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm, as such would fall outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 39, of the Residential Design SPD. However, it would not be highly prominent within the street scene and dormers with a similar style can be found in the immediate vicinity. Within this context, on balance, it is considered that this element of the proposal would be acceptable.\r\rThe construction of the proposed rear extension would involve the part demolition of the existing kitchen/dinner. The rear extension would have a total parapet roof height of approximately 3.2m and a total depth of approximately 4m, extending past the existing rear outrigger (kitchen/dinner) by approximately 1.75m. Although the depth would fall outside the guidance of the Residential Design SPD for semi-detached dwellings, it would not be visible from the street scene and it would have a relatively modest height.\r\rOverall, it is considered that there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and it is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylight of the proposed rear extension which would be a maximum of approximately 2.6m in height. The proposed single-storey rear extension would not breach the BRE 45-degree rule on both plan and elevation for No. 37 and No.41 Albemarle Gardens.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would maintain a separation distance from the shared boundary with No.41 of approximately 1.2m. Given the distance and reasonable height, the proposed development would not cause significant harm in regard to the loss of light. \r\rThe closest window and door at No.37 serve a family room, whilst officers acknowledge that the window would be breached when performing the 45-degree test, however, the space would still get sufficient light from the door. \r\rGiven the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013  seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy DM8 on Sustainable Travel for New Development, in the Kingston Core Stratgery states 'prioritise the access needs of pedestrians and cyclists in the design of new developments and protect and enhance pedestrian and cycle access routes to, and where possible, through development sites, including the protection or enhancement of the strategic cycling and walking networks, as shown on the Proposals Map.' \r\rThe Council's Vehicle Crossover Policy, April 2020 states that an opening size, minimum of 2.7m and maximum of 4.0m must be provided at the back of the footway, measured at right angles to the public highway. The proposed vehicle crossover would be widened to approximately 7.1m falling outside the Vehicle Crossover Policy, such that the Highway Authority would not grant consent. It is understood that the 4m maximum width is in place to protect pedestrian and highway safety.\r\rTherefore, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety, the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
