    "You have questioned whether a planning application is needed for your proposed works. As you have already submitted a planning application we would need further documents from you to make the application valid. For example, the Existing and Proposed Floor Plans do not meet the validation requirements as detailed within the Local List. If you would like formal advice on this proposal then may we suggest that you seek pre-application advice. The service is provided by the council and you will be able to seek detailed advice from a Planning Officer before you have detailed plans drawn. If you decide to withdraw your planning application you will receive a fee refund.\rDetails of the Pre-application service are here: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/applications/pre-application-advice\r\rThe Planning Portal also offers advice on planing applications: https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission\r\rPlease let us know how you wish to proceed.",
    "Site photographs indicate that works on the extension have commenced such that a prior notification application for a larger extension could not be used to regularise what has been built (this application type must be submitted prior to any works taking place).\r\rGiven the above, the side extension is not permitted development and planning permission is required. The applicant is advised to submit a Householder Planning Application to regularise what has been built.\r"
