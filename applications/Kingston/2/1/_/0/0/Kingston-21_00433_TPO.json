    "Introduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThe Development Plan comprises:\n\nThe London Plan 2021;\nRBK Core Strategy 2012;\nKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\nThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nConsultations\n9no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \n\nProposal \nThe application seeks full planning permission for   the demolition of existing single storey garage, erection of part two storey/ part single storey side and single storey side and and single storey rear wrap around extension to join side extension. \n\nApplication Site\nThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling and resides within The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character. \n\nPlanning Assessment \nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- Impact upon Highways\n- Impact on Heritage Assets\n- Fire Safety \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the demolition of existing single storey garage, erection of part two storey/ part single storey side and single storey rear wraparound extension to join side extension . \n\nThe proposed ground floor side extension would project a maximum depth of 11.26m  and width of 2.65m.The proposed rear extension element  would project a depth of 3.5m and would be set  by 0.3645m  from the boundary with neighbouring no118 Clarence Avenue.  It would have a single aspect pitch roof with an eaves height of  2.575m and maximum pitch  height of 3.939.9m  accommodating 3nos velux windows . The proposed rear elevation would present bi folding doors and a single window. \n\nOfficers note the proposed ground floor side extension would not be set back from the original  front elevation of the dwelling as per the recommendation set out in Policy Guidance 36 in the Residential Design SPD. However, in the context of the relationship of the dwelling with neighbouring no 114  and the alignment  of the  proposed front building line this is deemed acceptable. \n\nIn terms of the proposed first floor side extension, it would  present a width of 1.64m, depth of  7.29m  and be positioned within the built footprint of the proposed ground floor side extension. It  would be  appropriately set back  from the front elevation  and the proposed rear elevation would be in alignment with the existing . Single windows would be presented on both the rear and front elevation  and 2no obscure glazed windows would be presented on the proposed east elevation . \n\nIn terms of roof form  arrangements,  the proposed ground floor extension would present  a single aspect  roof  which would wrap round to the front elevation. On the proposed roof slope facing toward no114 Clarence Avenue 2no velux windows are proposed.  Overall, it is considered that the roof of the side extension relates well to the main house. The proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\n\nWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the part two storey/ part single storey side and single storey rear wraparound extension to join side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\n\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring properties at nos 114 and 118 Clarence Avenue.\n\nOfficer Comment:  \nIn considering the impact of daylight at no 118 by the proposed extension the proposals would pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable room window . Within this context, it is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour. \n\nIn considering the impact of daylight at no 114  by the proposed extension the proposals would pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable room window . Within this context, it is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour. \n\nOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nImpact upon Highways\nPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\n\nThe application involves the demolition of the existing garage space to the rear of the property. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\n\nThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\n\nHeritage Assets\nSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\n\nSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \nParagraphs 195 to 208 of the NPPF (December 2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\n\nOfficer comment:  The application site falls within The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character , a designated non heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposed extension would not have any adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not harm the significance of The Berg Estate  Local Area of Special Character. \n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\n\nGround Level / Base Level\nUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\n\n\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n",
    "The scale bar in the proposed site plan is incorrect, it measures to 5m instead of 10m in 1:100 scale as stated. Please provide a Proposed Block Plan/Site Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
