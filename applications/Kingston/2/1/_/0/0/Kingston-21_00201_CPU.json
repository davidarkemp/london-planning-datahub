    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. The significance of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area is as an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre. It contains houses of various sizes and designs, dating mainly from 1820 to 1900 and focused around Fairfield Recreation Ground, which has been a recreational open space since 1855.\r\rProposal\rErection of two storey rear extension, raising roof height and erection of rear 'piggyback' roof extension with installation of 5nos. rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rConsultation\r13 Neighbouring properties were notified and one letter of objection has been received stating;\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r\rKingston CAAC - Objection - Would be first piggy back extension in this road. Resulting roof ridge height would be considerably in excess of anything else in the immediate neighbourhood. In addition, northern flank wall is already overbearing with no architectural interest, just blank brickwork. This would be made worse by the step-up step-down features of the enlarged wall & further detract from the character & appearance of the CA. Mitigants suggested by the applicant are unconvincing eg possible future development of adjacent plot that may screen the north wall. Furthermore new roof lights not specified as conservation grade as they should be.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Impact on trees; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. This type of extension involves increasing the height of the rear part of the ridge of the roof. Extending the roof of an existing property in this way is unlikely to be appropriate in a Conservation Area and will only be supported where it can be\rdemonstrated that the existing character of the street will not be affected.\r\rPolicy guidance 40 of the Residential Design SPD states that there maybe some scope to obtain permission to construct a \"piggyback\" extension when the gaps between the first floor side elevations of neighbouring dwellings are no more than 2.1m to reduce the impact of the extension on the character of the streetscene. Officers note that there is a large space next to the site which means the piggyback would be highly visible, prominent and incongruous and would erode the tranquil environment and townscape character.\r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore an impact on the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. It is therefore necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. The applicant has not advanced any arguments as to the public benefits of the proposal, nor is it apparent to Officers that there would be any. The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2023).\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that No. 42 Avenue Road has a primary bedroom window at first floor level on the northern flank elevation. Given the presence of a first floor side facing habitable room window and the proximity of the proposed piggyback extension, coupled with the two-storey rear extensions, it is considered that the proposed development would result in a loss of light to this habitable room. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light.\r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The applicant has not demonstrated through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of trees within a conservation area through damage to its root protection area. Issues identified by officers concern foundations and special foundation designs. It is considered that the necessary information could not be secured by way of a planning condition. The type of foundation could have implications for the design of the proposals and trees on site and it is therefore considered that this information must be submitted upfront.  \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
