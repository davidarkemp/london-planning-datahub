  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed single storey side/rear element of the proposed extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of its excessive depth, lack of visual interest and setback from the front elevation of the host building and would fail to be a proportionate addition to the existing dwelling which would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Due to the excessive depth and siting of the proposed single storey rear/side extension along the shared boundary, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring property. In particular, Nos. 41 and 43 Berrylands in terms of loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
