    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r5 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of single storey side/ rear extension. Fenestration change to anthracite grey aluminium frames on existing house  and to porch entrance. Application of smooth render to all external walls  \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\r\rPlanning History\r24/01163/HOU  - Erection of a single storey side/ rear extension. Fenestration change to anthracite grey aluminium frames on existing house to porch entrance. Application of smooth render to all external walls. Refused 12.07.24. Currency subject of Householder Appeal APP/Z5630/D/24/3349990\r \rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for erection of single storey side/ rear extension. Fenestration change to anthracite grey aluminium frames on existing house  and to porch entrance. Application of smooth render to all external walls. \r\rOfficers note the applicant has revisited the proposal following the refusal of an earlier application ( ref : 24/01163/HOU).\r\rThe proposed single storey side / rear extension would be set back from the existing front elevation  and project a maximum depth of 11.75m with a proposed rear extension element extending a depth of 3.32m . The proposed side storey  element would present a width of 1.91m. Officers note a design revision to the proposed side elevation facing towards no 161 Beresford Avenue  with the presentation of a stepped flank wall - a stepped  flank wall  at approximately 6m   back from the front elevation of the dwelling  and creating a separation distance  of 0.5m between the new build and the  shared boundary wall.  \r\rA single aspect  part hipped  tiled roof arrangement would be presented accommodating rooflights with the rear element including a  part hipped part flat crown type roof .  It would have an eaves height of 2.45m and single pitch roof height 3.63m. Bifolding doors would be presented on the rear elevation.  No new windows are presented on the side elevation facing towards no 161 Beresford Avenue. The proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rIn  the  accompanying supporting statement, Officers note reference  to the change of levels  at the application site itself  and the relationship with the adjoining neighbour.  \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring properties no 165 and no161 Beresford Avenue.\r\rOfficers note that the building line of the proposed rear extension would be in alignment with the building line of the existing conservatory  at neighbouring no 165 Beresford Avenue and therefore  the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupier of the property.\r\rIn respect of neighbouring no 161 Beresford Avenue,   taking account of the referenced changing  site  levels and the set back position  of the proposed extension along the shared site boundary levels, it is considered  that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers. \r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises pavement outside The Rotunda Centre on Clarence Street which is a busy pedestrian route. Close to the application site are cycle lanes, part of Borough Strategic Cycling Network. \r\rThe application site is located within Kingston Town Centre AAP and close to the Cromwell Bus Station Kingston Railway Station. Commercial premises in the vicinity of the application site are designated shopping frontages.\r\rProposal \rInstallation of \"Pulse Smart Hub\" with integrated digital screens\r\rConsultations\rRBK Highway Engineer - objects to the proposal\rDesigning  Out Crime Officer - objects to the proposal\r\rRepresentations\r14 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- The proposed advertising sign obstructs the end of the bike lane in a shared space area, and pedestrian crossing at a very busy junction\r\rOfficer comment:  The above concerns will be addressed within this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on Highway Safety\r- The impact of the development on Public Safety\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Sustainability \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the planning history for the site  and the application ref 17/12524/TEL for installation of a telephone kiosk (refused due to appearance and highway safety concerns) and allowed on the appeal ref: APP/Z5630/W/18/3192741.\r\rAs the proposed hub with digital display that would be approximately 2.54m high and 1.07m wide would be similar to the telephone kiosk application ref 17/12524/TEL, and given the proposed design and materials, the proposal is considered to be acceptable from character and appearance perspective. \r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer comment: It is noted that the proposal ref 17/12524/TEL was allowed on appeal and considered not to have an unacceptable impact on the highway safety. However, the current proposal failed to recognise the existing cycling route and didn't include it in the submission and did not show it on the plans. The appeal decision does not refer to the cyclist movement. It is considered that the site has physically changed since the submission of the application in 2017. \r\rThe proposed siting of the proposal at the end of a section of the C29 cycle route designated lane, along the A307, which would clearly obstruct the movement of cyclists is considered to be unacceptable. The proposed hub (especially when in use) due to its central position would also obstruct pedestrian movement. \r\rOfficers note similar application ref no 22/01117/FUL (APP/Z5630/W/22/3308886 and APP/Z5630/H/22/3308888) for installation of a multi-functional Communication Hub, where an Inspector  concluded that such a structure in a busy location would adversely affect pedestrian movements in the area. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would obstruct the movement of cyclists resulting in unacceptable impact on the highway safety. Furthermore, it would be an obstruction on the pavement which would result in nuisance and inconvenience to pedestrians at times of busy usage of the footway, contrary to Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies D3 and D8 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).\r\rCrime & Disorder\rSupporting paragraph 3.3.14 of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) states that: \"Measures to design out crime should be integral to development proposals and be considered early in the design process. Development should reduce opportunities for anti-social behaviour, criminal activities, and terrorism, and contribute to a sense of safety without being overbearing or intimidating.\" \r\rPolicies DM10 and DM22 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that development proposal should incorporate the principles of safe design to reduce the risk and fear of crime. \r\rPolicy CS14 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will seek to improve community safety to reduce the negative effects of crime, fear of crime and alcohol misuse. \r\rThe Council has a legal duty under the Crime and Disorder Act 1998 (as amended) to exercise its various functions with due regard to the likely effect of the exercise of those functions on, and the need to do all that it reasonably can to prevent:\ra) crime and disorder in its area (including anti-social and other behaviour adversely affecting the local environment; and\rb) the misuse of drugs, alcohol and other substances in its area; and re-offending in its area\r\rOfficer Comment: The Metropolitan Police Secure By Design Officer strongly objected to the proposal:\r'Unfortunately due to the lack of required information, the positioning of the hub in a high risk crime location and proposition to supply a controlled medicine to the public readily myself, on behalf of the Commissioner of Metropolitan Police, I object to this planning application on the grounds of Crime  and Disorder for a Pulse Smart Hub to be installed outside the Rotunda on Clarence Street, Kingston  Upon Thames, KT1 1QP.' \r\rAs such, the proposal due to its sitting in a high risk crime location and  the ready provision to the public of Nasal Naloxone, as well as lack of management practices information would not represent principles of safe design to reduce risk and fear of crime, contrary to  Policies DM10 and CS14 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: .Overall, considering the position, scale, character of the area and the submitted information, it is considered that the proposed Hub would not give rise to any significant adverse impact on the amenities of neighbours.\r\rSustainability\rParagraph 158 of the NPPF (2023) states that the planning system should support the transition to a low carbon future in a changing climate. Paragraph 162 sets out that Local Planning Authorities should expect new development to: take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rSupporting paragraph 9.2.1 to Policy SI2 (Minimising greenhouse gas emissions) of the London Plan (2021) sets out the Mayor's commitment to London becoming a zero-carbon city. The energy hierarchy (Figure 9.2) should inform the design, construction and operation of new buildings. The priority is to minimise energy demand. Kingston Council declared a Climate Emergency in 2019.\r\rOfficer comment: While the applicant declares that 'Our objective is to contribute as little as possible to non-recyclable waste and we are striving towards all energy used to come from 100% renewable sources' insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed Hub has followed the energy hierarchy in order to minimise the amount of energy consumed to deliver the proposed services.\r\rOfficers note similar applications ref no 22/01123/FUL (APP/Z5630/W/22/3303488 and APP/Z5630/H/22/3303489), 22/01129/FUL (APP/Z5630/W/22/3303485 and APP/Z5630/H/22/3303487) and 22/01117/FUL (APP/Z5630/W/22/3308886 and APP/Z5630/H/22/3308888) for installation of a multi-functional Communication Hub, where an Inspector concluded that it has not been demonstrated that energy consumption by the proposal has been minimised.\r\rAs such, it has not been demonstrated the proposal has been suitably designed to minimise energy consumption in the provision of its services, in accordance with the energy hierarchy, contrary to the NPPF (2023) and Policy SI2 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\rNo comments received\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r- Flooding\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a detailed Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rFlooding - the site falls within Flood zone 2 - a conditions about flood resilience measures would be imposed on any permission.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
