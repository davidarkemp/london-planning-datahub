    "Due to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the residential amenities of neighbouring properties or on the character and appearance of the property or the wider area. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of accurate and consistent drawings, that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenities of adjoining No. 28 Endway or on the character and appearance of the existing property or the wider area, in conflict with the Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Officers note the recent planning history. The applicant is reminded that implementing this development in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful. This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. The applicant is strongly advised to seek further advice before proceeding with any approval.",
    "The Validation Local List requires Time Stamped Photographs of the site to be provided with the application submission. Please see the Local List for further guidance and submit these.\r"
