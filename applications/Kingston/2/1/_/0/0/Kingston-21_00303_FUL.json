    "Condition 3 (External materials) - It is noted that the Appeal Decision stated \"The appellant has indicated agreement to changing the proposed materials in order to produce a more unified appearance. I am therefore satisfied that a condition requiring the Council's approval of the finished materials of the works to the rear of the dwelling would resolve this issue\" \rThe Appeal scheme was allowed on the basis that the originally proposed materials were unacceptable and that different materials would need to be submitted via planning condition. The details include zinc cladding for the dormer (a material which the Inspector agreed would be problematic). As it stands, the submitted details are not considered to satisfy the requirements of Condition 2 or the reason for its imposition by the Inspector.",
    "The description in the application form is to erect front porch and garage conversion, whereas the proposed floor plans and elevtions show rear extension also, please clarify and amend the drawings."
