    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows at first floor level in the east elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the 2.8 Old Malden Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rThe application is located within the Critical Drainage Area. \r\rProposal \rErection of two storey side, first floor side and rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. 1 neutral representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Concerns regarding the drainage as the proposal would significantly increase the footprint/roof area; Possible adverse impact on soakways and drainage at the adjoining property. \r\rOfficer comment: Whilst the application site falls within the critical drainage area, given the scale of the proposal and the proposed footprint, it is not considered to adversely affect the existing drainage systems or result in increased surface water flooding. In any event the use of a Soakaway on neighbouring land would be a matter for the neighbours to agree between themselves. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Manor Close was originally characterised by semi-detached dwellings with cat-slide roofs. However, over recent years the character of the street scene has changed. A number of properties have been extended by means of first floor side extensions which has resulted in the loss of the original cat-slide roof at No 12 (ref: 19/03082/HOU), at No. 3 (ref: 16/14130/HOU), No. 6 (ref: 12/14210/HOU) and No.8 (ref: 27806). These constructed first floor side extensions have not been set-back from the front elevation and contain a hipped roof form.\r\rIn this case, the proposed first floor side extension would be of a similar design to those constructed on the adjoining properties nos 8 and 10. \r\rThe proposed two storey side extension, due to its modest width and siting and the proposed roof form would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and similar developments on Manor Close. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would be approximately 2.4m deep. Given its siting and the proposed scale as well as the proposed roof design it is considered to be acceptable. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would pass the 45 and 25 degree rules in relation to the nearest habitable windows at both adjoining properties. \r\rGiven the proposed scale and siting of the extension, it is not considered to appear as an overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Compliance with Policy D12(A) - 10 Manor Close statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises commercial premises on Church in the mixed in use area. The site is located in Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the host property is a listed building.\r\rConsultation \r\rHeritage Officer - no objection to the revision subject to conditions.\r\rKingston Town CAAC - Objection. Positives of this PA include the improved shop frontage & new cast iron rain water goods throughout. But these are more than offset by the following negatives which would cause harm to the character & appearance of 12/12/2024, 10:29 KTCAAC. this grade 2 listed building & wider CA: acrylic moulded logos on front, side & rear elevations in contravention of the LPA's guidelines on development in CAs (comments on 24/02411 refer); bladed/ projecting signs at first floor level & illuminated on the front & part side elevations, again in breach of the Council's guidance (see 24/02411); new plant, including unspecified solar panels, on rear/ side roof top which would be clearly visible from the public realm; installation of a door to first floor canteen onto rear roof space,resulting in an inappropriate outdoor amenity in this location. The magazine hopper cut into shop front would be the first of its kind in the market place and would need to be executed with care.\r\r\rRelevant History \r24/02411/ADV - Display of 3nos internally illuminated fascia signs and 1no externally illuminated projecting sign. - Granted on 21.03.2025 \r24/02380/LBC - Fenestration alteration, installation of ventilation grilles. Replacement of rainwater goods with cast iron. Roof work with new slate tiles in existing pitched roof, new deck on rear top flat roof and first floor flat roof including roof covering. Brickwork repairment. Internal alteration and advert. pending\r\rProposal \rFenestration alteration, installation of ventilation grilles. Replacement of rainwater goods with cast iron. Roof work with new slate tiles in existing pitched roof, new deck on rear top flat roof and first floor flat roof including roof covering. Brickwork repairment. Internal alteration and advert.\r\rAssessment\r\rDesign and Heritage\r \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas and listed buildings, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rThe NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would include fenestration alteration, installation of ventilation grilles, replacement of rainwater goods with cast iron, roof work with new slate tiles in existing pitched roof, new deck on rear top flat roof and first floor flat roof including roof covering, brickwork repairment, internal alteration and advertisement for signs and logo.\r\rThe applicant removed the solar panel element during the course of the application. Council's Heritage Officer was consulted and no objection was raised subject to a pre-commencement condition for submission and approval of windows, doors and louvre vents details.It is considered that the proposed works would preserve the building's appearance and special architectural features and its historic interest.\r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property or the surrounding area or harm the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the listed building.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given its scale, design and location, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood\r\rThe site is located in Environment Agency Flood Zone 2, however no ground works are proposed and the site footprint will not alter. Therefore it is considered not to have a significant impact on this element. \r\rFire safety \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exemption Statement. The submitted information is considered appropriate and this element will not be adversely affected by the development. \r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.
