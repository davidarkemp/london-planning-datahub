    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the proposed dormers, would appear as an incongruous and unduly prominent feature within the Ellerton Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Inspection: Site inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\rAssessment: The works are appropriate due to the Horse chestnut being dead. \rRecommendation: Approve felling and replant with one replacement tree. \r\r",
