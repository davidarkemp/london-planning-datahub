(d) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Offices note inaccurate plans submitted in support of the proposal and lack of an appropriate certificate of the application form signed (the proposed extension would encroach on the adjoining land at No 11). Due to significant inaccuracies (for example, the total height on the proposed side elevations measures approximately 3.6m but on the rear elevation is indicated and measures as 3.895m, the proposed eaves height varies between 2.6m - 2.8m) Officers are not able to fully assess the impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe applicant is advised that, in accordance with the ruling in Choiceplace Properties Ltd v Secretary of State for Housing Communities and Local Government [2021] EWHC 1070 (Admin), it is incumbent on the applicant to provide accurate drawings. The relationship between a proposed development and neighbouring structures is a matter to be accurately depicted on plans. If the drawings were to be found inaccurate this may invalidate any planning permission.\r\rWith regards to the proposed depth of the extension of approximately 4.5m, it would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth which is up to 3.5m for terraced dwellings. However, considering the proposed depth and the size of the rear gardens at the application site and adjoining properties, the proposed depth, in isolation and subject to appropriate eaves height and design, is likely to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the inaccurate drawings submitted in support of the proposal, the Officers are not able to fully access the impact of the proposal on the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining properties. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:\r\rOn the 1st May 2024 the Council adopted a new Validation Local List.
