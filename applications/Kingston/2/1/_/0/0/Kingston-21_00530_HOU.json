  "description": "Erection of single storey front and side extension with associated changes to fenestration",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "Due to the the bulk, massing and design of the proposed single storey side and front extensions the proposed development would not result in a building of a residential appearance and create a disorderly and incongruous appearance from the street. Furthermore, the proposed development would not relate well to the original dwelling, or those in the immediate surrounding area, thereby resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the original dwelling and immediate surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to the lack of private outdoor amenity space provision the proposed development would have an adverse impact upon the amenity of future occupants of the development, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposed development would result in the loss of 1 off-street car parking space and the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of supporting documentation or cogent evidence that this loss would not have an adverse impact on on-street car parking and highway/pedestrian safety in the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019, Policies T4, and T6 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Site Location Plan - the red line must include land necessary to carry out the proposed development, i.e. land required for access to the site from a public highway. Please amend the red line boundary. If the access is not solely owned by the Applicant then the owner must be informed and Ownership Certificate B of the Application Form must be completed.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSite\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received to object to the proposal on the grounds of noise, unacceptable use and amenity impact.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would be approx. 7m deep and  6.28m wide with a flat roof height 2.5m. The proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling. Within the context of the existing built form on site having a large rear garden and the siting of the building,  it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective. \r\rThe applicant has informed that the outbuilding would be used for a purpose that is ancillary/incidental to the existing dwelling (home gym). In any case, a planning condition would secure this in the event of approval.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and scale of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy Statement which suitably addresses the relevant provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Proposal\r\rThe application seeks to make amendments to prior approval ref: 21/02810/PRA. The changes sought, as stated on the application form, are as follows:\r\r- Removal of external staircase on North elevation and installation of new staircase as approved in planning consent: 22/03946/FUL;\r- Replace external door to above staircase with a window.\r- Replace 2x small single windows with one larger format to match other windows in property.\r\rUnder 'Please state why you wish to make this amendment' the following is stated:\r\r'Remove staircase; to create a more welcoming access to the apartment (as approved in planning consent: 22/03946/FUL).  Replace with window to retain consistency on external elevation / improve external aesthetics of apartment through consistency of window size.'\r\rAssessment\r\rIt is noted that prior approval ref: 21/02810/PRA was granted under Class MA, Schedule 2, Part 3 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order (England) 2015 (as amended). Class MA permits: \r\r'Development consisting of a change of use of a building and any land within its curtilage from a use falling within Class E (commercial, business and service) of Schedule 2 to the Use Classes Order to a use falling within Class C3 (dwellinghouses) of Schedule 1 to that Order.'\r\rClass MA does permit operational development. The only changes shown on the drawings for prior approval ref: 21/02810/PRA comprised the replacement of fenestration with fenestration of a similar appearance and other works which would not have likely comprised development as per Section 55(2)(a)(ii) of The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).\r\rThis non-material amendment application seeks to introduce new windows. It is considered that new windows and the associated building works comprise development which would require planning permission and would be beyond the scope of the Class MA prior approval. Similarly, the proposed new staircase (referenced as being approved under 22/03946/FUL) would fall outside of the scope of the original prior approval.\r\rNotwithstanding the procedural concerns listed above, and assuming that such changes were possible under Class MA, it is considered that the proposed amendments would be greater than non-material as they have the potential to impact neighbouring amenity and also the character and appearance of the area. Such changes would also warrant formal neighbour notification.\r\rWhile not stated on the application form, it also appears that changes to the internal layout of the prior approval accommodation is being proposed. The implications of the changes shown, such as potentially no longer complying with the Nationally Described Space Standards, are considered to be greater than non-material also.\r\rFor the reasons set out above, the non-material amendment application is refused.",
    "Please revise a Validation Checklist if require. The new  Local List and Validation Checklists can be obtained via the council's website: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\r\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r"
