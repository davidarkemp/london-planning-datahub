    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the proposed first floor side extension, would result in the loss of the distinctive cat-slide roof form and would disrupt the symmetry with No. 44 Mayfair Avenue, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
