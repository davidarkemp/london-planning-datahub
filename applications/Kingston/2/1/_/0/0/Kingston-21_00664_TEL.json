    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property, the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Application Site: \r \rThe application relates to a 2-storey detached property located on the south east of Ditton Road. The property has a single-storey rear outrigger and a single-storey attached garage. \r\rThe site is located 340m south west of the Ewell Road South Local Centre. The development in the direct vicinity is predominantly residential with 2-storey detached and semi-detached properties.  \r\rThe site is not located within a conservation area nor is it, or located nearby to, a statutory listed building and non-designated heritage asset. \r\rThe rear of the property is within Flood Zone 2 meaning it has a medium probability of flooding from rivers and the sea.\r\rDitton Road is an unclassified road. The site is not located in a controlled parking zone. The site has a PTAL rating of 2 on a scale of 0-6b with 6b being the most accessible, meaning it has poor public transport accessibility.  Bus stops are located within a 3-minute walk along the A243 Hook Road and Surbiton train station is an 18-minute walk away from the site. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is for the demolition of the existing house and erection of a two-storey detached house with accommodation in the roof space. \r\rRelevant History: \r\r3588/S: Alterations and extensions to dwelling house. Granted 15.10.1958\r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 10 adjoining landowners/occupants were consulted and no responses were received. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Principle of Development \r- Standard of Accommodation\r- Character and Design \r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Highways and Transportation\r- Biodiversity and Landscaping\r- Sustainability and Climate Change\r- Flood Risk and Drainage\r- Fire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development: \r\rThe London Plan 2021 (LP) Policy GG2 and Paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 (NPPF) promote the redevelopment of underutilised land for the delivery of housing. Policy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (CS) sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the LP. LP Policy H1 sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10-year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThe Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply of housing land as required by the NPPF therefore, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In other words, the tilted balance weighs a development's adverse impacts against its benefits, not on a level playing field, but tilted towards granting permission. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application. \r\rThe proposed dwelling is proposed to be a self-build or custom build development. Paragraph 016 (Reference ID: 57-016-20210208) of the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) states that 'in considering whether a home is a self-build or custom build home, relevant authorities must be satisfied that the initial owner of the home will have primary input into its final design and layout. Off-plan housing, homes purchased at the plan stage prior to construction and without input into the design and layout from the buyer, are not considered to meet the definition of self-build and custom housing.' \r\rThe client is not listed on Council's Self-Build and Custom Housing Building Register. No evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the client has had input into the design and layout of the scheme and would be a genuine self-build home. Accordingly, the new dwellings are not considered to meet the definition of self-build housing. \r\rThe proposal would demolish a 3-bedroom family home and replace it with a 5-bedroom family home. The principle of residential development on the site is supported as it would not result in the loss of a family-sized home, in compliance with CS Policy DM14. This carries weight in favour of the application. Support for the principle of development is subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rLP Policy D6 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall GIA, built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. CS Policy DM13 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rThe proposed dwellinghouse would have a gross internal area (GIA) of 355sqm. There are no specific standards under LP Policy D6 for a 3-storey 5-bedroom, 10-person dwelling. However, the proposed GIA would far exceed the minimum 134 qm GIA requirement for a 3-storey 5-bedroom 8-person dwelling under LP Policy D6. The overall GIA, bedroom sizes and storage space are considered acceptable.\r\rThe dwelling would be dual aspect which is preferred in accordance with LP Policy D6 as single-aspect dwellings are more difficult to ventilate naturally and are more likely to overheat. Each habitable room would be serviced by at least one openable window or door for suitable ventilation, outlook and access to natural light, in compliance with LP Policy D6. No sunlight/daylight assessment has been submitted however, Officers confirm the habitable rooms would likely achieve the required standards under BRE Guidance. \r\rObscure glazing for all windows that service bathrooms will be secured by condition to protect the privacy of future occupants. \r\rThe Proposed Section Plan confirms the dwelling would achieve a minimum 2.5m floor-to-ceiling height for 86.5% of the GIA in compliance with LP Policy D6. Future occupants would achieve an acceptable standard of daylight penetration, ventilation, cooling and sense of space.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would have a rear garden of approximately 250sqm in compliance with CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) (2013). \r\rThe new dwelling would meet at least Building Regulation M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings' in terms of step-free access which is in compliance with LP Policy D7. \r\rIn summary, the proposed dwelling would achieve an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants, in terms of daylight, ventilation and cooling, and sense of space in compliance with LP Policy D6, CS Policy DM10 and policy guidance under the Residential Design Guide SPD. This is given neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rCharacter and Design: \r\rPara 131 of the NPPF states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rCS Policy CS8 and DM10 and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide SPD require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of the existing dwellinghouse and construction of a larger dwellinghouse. The new dwelling has a development footprint of 193 sqm covering 35% of the site area, which is a 15.5% increase beyond the existing plot coverage. Officers consider the proposed development footprint and plot coverage would generally be acceptable given that it would not exceed more than 50% of the site area. \r\rThe proposed dwelling would have an overall height of 8.7m with a ridge height approximately 0.9m higher than the current roof ridge. The dwelling height would generally match the adjoining dwelling to the south at no. 59 and be 1.2m higher than no. 54. Officers consider the proposed development height to be supportable given it generally matches the height of development in the direct vicinity. \r\rThe dwellinghouse would have double gables at the front and a flat roof behind. This architectural style is evident on other properties on the street, including no. 41 and 60. Officers consider the style and appearance of the dwelling would be consistent with the character of the street in compliance with LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rThe dwelling would include dormers on either side of the roof and a rear dormer. These are considered acceptable as they are of a modest size and appropriately set down from the roof ridge, up from the roof eaves and in from the roof sides. \r\rThe Design and Access Statement confirms the dwelling would be constructed of handmade buff yellow brick on the front facade and ground floor sides, white render on the sides and rear with a grey slate roof and aluminum black windows. Officers consider these materials to be high-quality and will be secured by condition. \r\rThe proposed development is considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, height, massing and design. The proposal would not result in adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the local area. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. \r\rCS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rThe principal properties that have been considered are the dwellinghouses directly to the north and south of the property at no. 55 and 59 Ditton Road. The rear garden of no. 61 adjoins the rear boundary of the property therefore, no impacts on the amenity of these neighbours is expected.\r\rThe new dwelling is built to the northern boundary and is separated from no. 55 by 1m. A 0.8m setback has been provided on the southern site boundary providing a 2.4m separation to no. 61. This is the same siting as the existing dwellinghouse with the exception of the increased two-storey bulk on the southern boundary that would be very similar to the scale of no. 61. Officers are satisfied the proposal would retain appropriate gaps between the properties and would not result in a terracing effect. The same front building line is maintained which is supported as it will maintain the visual appearance of the streetscape. Officers do not consider the proposed development would result in overbearing enclosure on neighbouring properties. \r\rThe submitted 45-Degree Plan demonstrates the proposal would comply with the 45-degree test from the nearest windows on no. 55 and 61 and would not result in unacceptable impacts on neighbouring occupants, in terms of overbearing enclosure or loss of daylight, in compliance with LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 17 in Council's Residential Design Guide SPD. \r\rIn terms of privacy and overlooking, side facing windows are proposed however, these will all be obscure glazed given they service bathrooms or are secondary windows to bedrooms. Obscure glazing will be secured by condition. \r\rThe proposed development is for a replacement dwellinghouse which would be in keeping with the residential character of the area. The comings and goings to the property would increase with the increase in bedrooms however,  Officers do not consider the noise and disturbance levels would extend beyond reasonable expectations for a sustainable suburban location. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not cause undue harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, and noise and disturbance, subject to final details being secured by condition. Compliance with LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10 has been demonstrated. This is given neutral weight in the assessment of the scheme.\r\rHighways and Transportation:\r\rNPPF para 116 states development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network, following mitigation, would be severe. CS Policy DM10 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rNo Transport Statement was submitted with the application. The Proposed Site Plan confirms the existing single vehicle crossover would be maintained and 3 off-street car parks would be provided, similar to the existing situation. The number of car parks exceeds the maximum standards under LP Table 10.3 (maximum of 1 car park within an Outer London PTAL 2 location) however, given it is the same as the existing arrangement, the Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer considers it to be acceptable. An electric vehicle charging point (EVCP) would be installed for the new dwelling. This is in line with LP Policy T6.1. Final details of the EV charging will be secured by condition. \r\rThe Design and Access Statement states a cycle storage room would be provided by the side of the dwelling however, the location and details of the cycle storage arrangement have not been identified on the submitted plans. In line with LP Policy T5, a minimum of 2 cycle parking spaces would be required for the proposed dwelling size (3 bedroom house). Final cycle storage details have been secured by condition. Cycle storage should be located outside the dwelling within a secure, weatherproof enclosure, preferably in the forecourt in compliance with TfL's London Cycle Design Standards, LP Policy T5 and CS Policy CS6 and DM8. \r\rThe Design and Access Statement also confirms that storage for bins would be provided in an external timber storage shed to the side of the dwelling; however, the location and details of the refuse storage arrangement have not been identified on the submitted plans. Final refuse storage details have been secured by condition. The quantum of refuse storage must be in compliance with the Residential Design Guide SPD and should be secure, weatherproof and within 15m drag distance of the kerbside for ease of collection.  \r\rA Construction Management Plan has been secured by condition to the construction process, in terms of impacts on the local road network and noise and disturbance, are appropriately managed. \r\rOverall, Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has not objected to the proposal. The proposal exceeds the maximum residential car parking standards under LP Policy T6.1 however, given it replicates the existing situation this is afforded limited weight in the planning balance. The proposal would not adversely impact the local road network and would provide sufficient cycle and refuse storage facilities, subject to final details being secured by condition. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rBiodiversity and Landscaping: \r\rParagraph 187 of the NPPF states that planning decisions should contribute to  and enhance the natural and local environment by minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity. \r\r\rLP Policy G6 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain (BNG). A mandatory BNG of 10% is required under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021). This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process.  \r\rCS Policy DM10 sets out that development proposals should ensure that landscaping is an integral part of the overall design of all new developments and that landscaping proposals are submitted as part of planning applications.\r\rThere are no statutory designations of local, national or international importance within the boundaries of the site. A waterway runs through the rear of the site. Fishponds Park is located 330m north-east of the site which is a designated Local Open Space. \r\rThe submitted Biodiversity Checklist confirms the site is not, nor is it located nearby to, a designated site or priority habitat and would not impact protected or priority species. However, the proposal involves demolition of a pre-1960 property within close proximity to a waterway meaning the development has the potential to impact on bats, breeding birds and other protected species. No Preliminary Ecological Appraisal has been completed by a qualified ecologist. Officers confirm that insufficient evidence has been provided to evidence if there are protected or priority species on the site and if mitigation measures are required to manage potential impacts on ecological features, contrary to LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. \r\rOn the Application Form, the applicant has stated the proposal is exempt from BNG as the development is a self-build and custom build development. No evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the new dwellings would meet the definition of self-build housing (as discussed in the Principle of Development section of this report). As such, Officers consider BNG would apply and insufficient evidence has been provided to demonstrate the mandatory BNG of 10% can be achieved, contrary to LP Policy G6. \r\rA Proposed Landscape Plan has been submitted. If the proposal was otherwise acceptable, a final landscape plan would have been secured with details of long-term management measures. \r\rOverall, insufficient information, in the form of a Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, has been provided to assess whether the proposed development would not result in unacceptable impacts on ecology and biodiversity on the site, and the proposed development would be exempt from BNG, contrary to para 193 of the NPPF, LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. This carries weight against the proposal. \r\rClimate Change and Sustainability:\r\rNPPF at para 161 sets an expectation that planning will support transition to net zero by 2050. \r\r\rLP Policy SI 2 requires major development to be net zero-carbon. Although the subject application is not a major application, greenhouse gas emissions should be minimised to the greatest extent possible. \r\r\rCS Policy DM3 states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling. \r\r\rThe Design and Access Statement states the proposed development would incorporate energy efficiency standards, including passive measures, such as the development's orientation and design, such as thermal insulation, double and triple glazing, energy efficient lighting and plumbing. Active measures have also been incorporated, including an air source heat pump, mechanical heat recovery ventilation system and PV panels. The proposal is considered to generally accord with LP Policy SI 2 and CS Policy DM1 and DM3. \r\r\rA condition has been secured to ensure the proposed dwelling would achieve a mains water consumption of 105L or less per person per day, in line with the Optional Requirement of the Building Regulations and specified in LP Policy SI 5. This is a neutral matter in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rFlood Risk and Drainage:\r\r\rThe NPPF at para 181 states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood-risk assessment. LP Policy SI 12 confirms development proposals should ensure that flood risk is minimised and mitigated, and that residual risk is addressed. \r\rThe NPPF at para 182 confirms that applications which could affect drainage on or around the site should incorporate sustainable drainage systems to control flow rates and reduce volumes of runoff. LP Policy S1 13 states that development proposals should aim to achieve greenfield run-off rates and ensure that surface water run-off is managed as close to its source as possible. \r\r\rCS Policy DM4 requires development proposals to give full consideration to the Borough Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 2024 (SFRA) and related studies including the surface water management plans, to include sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) to manage and reduce surface water run-off, demonstrate that there is adequate public sewerage capacity to serve their development and deal with surface water run-off. \r\r\rThe rear part of the garden is within Flood Zone 2. Although the development footprint would be located outside the identified flood area, the Council's SFRA states that the whole site should be considered to be affected by flooding given to take into account any inaccuracy in the mapping. A dwellinghouse has a vulnerability classification of 'less vulnerable.' The Environment Agency's standing advice applies to less vulnerable development in Flood Zone 2. A Flood Risk Assessment is required however none has been submitted. Officers acknowledge the proposal involves the replacement of the existing dwelling but the development footprint would be larger. A precautionary approach must be taken and Officers consider insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development would not be at undue risk of flooding or increase flood risk elsewhere. \r\r\rThe Design and Access Statement confirms that a SUDS scheme would be incorporated into the proposed development, however no details have been provided. Final details of the SUDS strategy would have been secured by condition. This matter is given neutral weight in the assessment of the scheme.\r\r\rOverall, insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development would not result in unacceptable flood risk on-site or elsewhere, contrary to LP Policy SI 12 and CS Policy DM4. This carries weight against the scheme. SUDS is proposed for the development and details of this would have been conditioned if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. This is a neutral matter in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rA Fire Plan for the ground, first and loft levels has been submitted that demonstrates the proposed development would provide suitable means of evacuation and fire safety measures, in the form of smoke detectors, in accordance with LP Policy D12. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. A Fire Statement would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. \r\r\rThe proposal would not result in a loss of a family-sized dwellinghouse in compliance with CS Policy DM14 and would continue to make a small but positive contribution towards the borough's housing supply which would carry positive weight in favour of the application. \r\r\rThe dwellinghouse has a scale, mass, siting and height that would respect the character and appearance of the local area. It would achieve an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants and would not adversely impact neighbouring residential amenity. There would be no impacts on highways and transportation. These matters carry neutral weight in the assessment of the scheme. \r\r\rInsufficient information, in the form of a Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, has been provided to assess whether the proposed development would not result in unacceptable impacts on ecology and biodiversity on the site, and the proposed development would be exempt from BNG, contrary to para 193 of the NPPF, LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. This carries significant weight against the proposal. \r\rNo Flood Risk Assessment has been submitted for the vulnerable development within the Flood Zone 2 applicable to the site. Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development would not be at an unacceptable risk of flooding or increase flood risk on neighbouring sites, contrary to para 181 of the NPPF, LP Policy SI 12 and CS Policy DM4. This carries significant weight against the proposal. \r\rMatters relating to cycle parking, refuse storage and collection, sustainability, trees, landscape are neutral matters which would have been secured by condition if the planning application was otherwise acceptable. \r\rOfficers have taken into account the Housing Delivery Test tilted presumption in favour of development as set out in para 11 of the NPPF whilst considering the conflicts with the Development Scheme. For this scheme, the adverse impacts of the development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole. As such, Officers recommend planning permission be refused.",
    "Please provide a Site Location Plan at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red and include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, car parking and open areas around buildings).\r"
