    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultation \r3 objections received on the grounds of:\r\r - Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r - Storage of hazardous substances\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rProposal \rApplication made under Section 73A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Drawings), Condition 3 (Material Samples) and Condition 16 (Details of Louvre Frosted Windows) for Application Reference Number: 23/01699/FUL \r\rThe proposed changes include:\r-reduction in size and length of obscured windows at north east elevation  \r-changes the louvre frosted windows to part frosted windows (1.7m high from floor level) at north east elevation \r-window alteration at south west elevation at first floor level\r\rAssessment\r\rOfficers note that concerns were raised regarding landscaping, light, noise, use and hazardous substances. The proposed amendments would not have an impact on these elements. Given the modest changes to the windows, it would not be detrimental to the character of the surrounding area in terms of design. The approved louvre windows will be changed to frosted windows up to 1.7m high from floor level, which is considered not to have significant impact on privacy to warrant refusal to the application. The window at first floor level at south west elevation will be changed to two slim windows and the change is considered minor and acceptable.\r\rThe changes described in the proposal section above to planning application 23/01699/FUL are considered to be both individually and cumulatively minor in nature. It is considered that the proposal would not: \r\r-change the quantum or nature of development approved:\r- materially change the character and appearance of the approved development in a way that would be detrimental to either the character and appearance of the development or that would fail to preserve or enhance the character and  appearance of the surrounding area. \r- cause harm to the residential amenity of existing neighbouring occupiers or future occupants of the development subject of this application\r- result in any highway safety concerns\r- prejudice fire safety\r- or adversely alter the sustainability and biodiversity of the development approved.\r\rIt is recommended that the changes be accepted and that the conditions 1, 3 and 16 are varied to include the drawings depicting the changes proposed. \r\rIt is recommended that the conditions attached to planning permission 23/01699/FUL are reapplied and modified where appropriate to reflect any condition applications that have been considered and a decision issued since the grant of planning permission 23/01699/FUL. \r\rIt is noted that para 14.2 of the legal agreement attached to planning permission 23/01699/FUL states that the legal agreement will continue to be valid and enforceable following an amendment or variation to the planning permission.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\r"
