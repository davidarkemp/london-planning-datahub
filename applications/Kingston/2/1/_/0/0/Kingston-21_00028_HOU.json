    "The proposed development, by reason of the depth, height and siting of the single storey rear extension, would appear overbearing when viewed from 35 Oakdene Drive and would deprive the occupants of this property from a reasonable outlook. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of two storey side and single storey rear extension. Alterations to existing rear extension. Roof extension with a rear dormer and installation of 2nos front rooflights.\r\rConsultations\r3 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the proposal approved previously under planning application ref 16/12569/HOU (Erection of two storey side extension. Alterations/extension to existing single storey rear extension. Erection of a rear dormer roof extension and rooflights to front) granted on 04.08.2016.\r\rConsidering the siting of the proposed two storey side extension, is set back from the front elevation and the proposed roof form, it is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, in general compliance with Policy Guidance 36. \r\rOfficers note the existing street scene that comprises different forms of buildings (block of flats as well as semi-detached dwellings), therefore the proposed scale, mass and bulk would be in-keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension, given its modest scale and the proposed design is considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension given its scale and the proposed design, is considered to appear as a proportionate addition to the host dwelling, in accordance with Policy Guidance 33. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed rear extension due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy Report, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
