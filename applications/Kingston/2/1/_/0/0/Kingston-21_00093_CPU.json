    "The proposed erection of rear a dormer roof extension (incorporating a juliet balcony) and the installation of 2 no. windows to the front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Condition 7 (Cycle Parking Facilities) of planning application ref 23/00567/OUT allowed on Appeal APP/Z5630/W/23/3321649 states:\r\rPrior to first occupation of any of the flats, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development (20 no. spaces) to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The cycle parking facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained for that purpose and kept free from obstruction thereafter. \r\rOfficer response: The submitted information is conflicting:  the submitted plan indicates various options, for example sedum living roof, however it is unclear if it is a part of the proposal. Furthermore, there are no details on the proposed locking system to ensure that the proposed storage would be secure.\r\rAs such, it is considered that insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate secure cycle storage facilities, in conflict with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Please submit 'Fire Statement/Plan.' If you consider the proposal does not require fire statement, please submit 'Reasonable Exception Statement.'"
