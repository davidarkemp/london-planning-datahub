    "The proposed development would extend more than 3.5m in height above the highest part of the roof of the adjoining terraced properties and the floor to ceiling height of an additional storey would exceed the lowest ceiling height of a storey of the existing building, contrary to AB.1 (d)(ii) and (g) of Class AB, Part 20, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development by reason of its design, bulk, and massing would detract from the appearance of the building and would be out of character and unduly prominent within the streetscene, and represent a discordant and incongruous feature which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The resulting building would appear visually intrusive and incongruous and would not be sympathetic to local character or the surrounding built environment, contrary to the NPPF (2019) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Condition AB.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AB of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the loss of commercial car parking spaces would lead to overspill car parking on the public highway and would not increase car parking pressures and adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Condition AB.2(1)(a) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AB of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
