    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultations \rNo response received \r\rRelevant History \r22/01296/HOU Erection of first floor side and part single/part two-storey rear extension Granted 14.06.2022\r22/03464/FUL Conversion of existing dwelling into 2nos flats. Erection of part two storey, part single storey rear and first floor side extension. Refused 28.12.2022\r\rAssessment\r\rThe application is a resubmission of refused planning application 22/03464/FUL. The application was refused for two reasons \r\r1. Given that the applicant has not robustly demonstrated that the proposal would meet the required ceiling to floor height for both dwellings, and that the front bedroom for the ground floor flat would sit in close proximity to both car parking spaces which would reduce the quality and outlook of this habitable room, it is considered that the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation for the future occupants of the both dwellings, and as such fail to accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r2. Given that the on-site car parking could not be delivered such that each car parking space could be accessed independently, with sufficient maneuvering space and with insufficient depth, the applicant  has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, inconsiderate parking, and increased on-street car parking pressure which could harm pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rThe scheme has been amended as follows:- \r\rReconfiguration of parking layout aided by a reduction in the projection of the ground floor footprint at the front of the property increasing the forecourt depth. This has reduced the the ground floor unit by c.4sqm. \r\rOfficers note in regards to the first reason for refusal of planning application 22/03464/FUL that the floor to ceiling heights would not meet the London Plan Plan space standards of 2.5 set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan. Secondly the car parking proposed in the amended scheme would stil be adjacent the bedroom of the ground floor unit proposed which would not over come the LPA's previous reason for refusal in regards to poor outlook and amenity for furture occupantsof the proposed unit. \r\rIn regards to the second reason for refusal of planning application 22/03464/FUL officers note the the applicant has proposed that the depth of the forecourt be increased but also shows a reduction to the width of the crossover. Whilst the depth would be increased officers still consider that the forecourt layout is not of a practical nature and car parking spaces would still not be accessed independently for each flat and manouvering of the cars would still be difficult and the potential for conflict bewteen the spaces due to inconsiderate parking is likley. In addition the space around the car parking spaces to allow access to the units themselves would be likley to be compromised and there would be a conflict between pedestrians and vehicles. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal does not overcome the reasons for refusal of the previous application 22/03464/FUL and it is recommended that those reasons be upheld. \r \rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r",
