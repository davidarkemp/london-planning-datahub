    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '26 Risborough Drive, Worcester Park, KT4 8DA', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 09.03.2021, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Inspection: Site inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\rAssessment: The works proposed are acceptable and will not have an adverse effect on the tree or reduce its amenity value. \rRecommendation: Approve tree surgery work.\r",
