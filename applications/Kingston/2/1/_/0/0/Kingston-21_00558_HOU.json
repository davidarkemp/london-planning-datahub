  "description": "Erection of two storey side extension with associated changes to fenestration and detached single storey outbuilding in rear garden to be used as home office.",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and detailed design of the proposed side extension, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Raeburn Avenue street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
