    "Due to its excessive height, bulk and mass the proposed development would not be subordinate or proportionate in relation to the main dwelling and would not relate well to the surrounding area, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to the Liverpool Road Conservation Area, that would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
