    "Due to the excessive bulk, scale and mass of both the front and rear dormer roof extensions and the uncharacteristic dormer extension on the front roof slope, the proposed development would appear unduly prominent within the West Road streetscene, and constitute incongruous additions that would not relate well to the host property, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Demolition of existing rear part, erection of single storey rear, second floor rear extension. Alteration to include mansard roof extension with rear dormer to create 2nos flats. Erection of two storey mew house at the rear including amenity space, bin storage and bicycle parking'."
