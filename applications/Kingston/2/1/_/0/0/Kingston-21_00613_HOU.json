  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling, would unduly erode the gap to No. 61 The Ridings resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the approved scheme 24/00831/FUL. It is proposed to change all existing and proposed timber framed fenestration into wood effect white UPVC heritage framed fenestration. It is considered that this would be a material change.\r\rIt is concluded that the changes do not constitute a non material amendment to planning permission 24/00831/FUL.",
    "The proposed site is categorised as a shop and a flat, the 'Ownership Certificate A' has been signed, please confirm the 'Ownership Certificate A' is correct, otherwise please amend the whole application form with correct 'Ownership Certificate'."
