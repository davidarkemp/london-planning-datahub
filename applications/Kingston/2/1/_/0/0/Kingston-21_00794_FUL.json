    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Flood Risk Zone 2. \r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing detached garage and erection of single storey rear extension and outbuilding studio.\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Flood Risk\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed infill single storey rear extension and its siting, it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rWith regards to the proposed outbuilding, given its siting, scale and the proposed eaves height of approximately 2.1m is considered to be in-keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed rear extension and the outbuilding due to their siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the garage remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Assessment submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling. A relevant condition would be attached to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy Report, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer -  no objection. Further comments are provided in the report. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for installation of vehicle crossover and alterations to boundary wall. \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling.  \r\rThe application site is within the Strategic Area of Special Character  for Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal  would introduce  a new vehicular crossover to  provide a new vehicle access from Derwent Avenue into the application site.  \r\rIn order to facilitate, the application would require the loss of a section of  the existing grass verge which runs parallel with Derwent Avenue. To accommodate the new direct access into the site, a section of the existing low level boundary wall would be removed and replaced by inward facing gates. Officers note that the existing front lawn would be replaced by a paved area. \r\rOfficers note the proposal also  includes alterations to the existing boundary wall of the site with the introduction of additional brick piers on the low lying boundary wall.  Whilst positioned in a prominent location on the corner of Derwent Avenue and Grassmere Avenue, proposed changes to the boundary walls  would  alter the character and appearance of the host dwelling  as well as upon the streetscene. However, Officers note that the boundary treatment of the other dwellings on the opposing corners of the Derwent Avenue/ Grasmere Avenue  as well as long both Avenues is  varied.\r\rWhilst the drawings show  the installation of boundary treatment between the brick piers together with the introduction of vehicle access  gates and pedestrian gate, no details have been provided in terms of the choice of materials  either on the drawings or on the application form. Should Officers be minded to approve the planning application, an appropriate planning condition would be attached to the planning permission requiring  details to be submitted of boundary treatment  of the altered boundary walls as well as the gates. \r\rGiven that a number of properties along  Derwent Avenue  have the benefit of vehicle crossovers and hardstanding  to the front of their dwellings and varying  boundary treatment, it is considered that the proposal  to be acceptable.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rDue to its minor nature, it is considered that the proposals would not cause undue harm to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers. Therefore, the proposal would comply with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that : appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network ( in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highway grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highways safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan,\r\rThe application has been reviewed by RBK Highways Officers and have advised that the proposed vehicle crossover appears acceptable in principle, However Highway Officers advise that its design must comply with the RBK Vehicle Crossover Policy guidance. The applicant would be required to submit a separate cross over application to RBK to be reviewed and determined by the RBK Vehicle Crossover Policy Officer prior to any works being undertaken.  \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 207 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe site is located within the  Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non designated heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would  not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not harm the significance of the  Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
    "Inspection: Site inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\rAssessment: The works proposed are acceptable and will not have an adverse effect on the trees or reduce their amenity value. \rRecommendation: Approve tree surgery work.\r"
