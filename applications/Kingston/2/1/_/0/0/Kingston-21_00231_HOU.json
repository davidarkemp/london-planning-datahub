    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale and depth would adversely impact the amenities of neighbouring properties No. 5 and 9 Woodbines Avenue by reason of loss of light/sunlight. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Inspection: Site inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\rAssessment: The works proposed are acceptable for the removal of one Silver birch on health and safety grounds.\rRecommendation: Approve felling and replant with one replacement tree. \r",
    "We are awaiting this amendment to the 1:1250 Site Location Plan - the red line must  include land necessary to carry out the proposed development, i.e. land required for access to the site from a public highway - please amend the Site Location Plan to include this within the red line.\r(Note: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red and any other land owned by the applicant in blue. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, car parking and open areas around buildings).)\r"
