Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site is located on the corner of Villiers Avenue and Cranes Park Crescent. The site is occupied by a detached residential building. \r\rThe surrounding area is residential in character and appearance.  \r\rConsultation \rNo response received\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks planning permission under section 73 to amend condition 7 of planning permission 19/01873/OUT to make the following changes \r\rThe proposed amendments as stated by the applicant and shown on the deposited plans are: \r\r- Amendment to side windows in side elevation facing 73 Villiers Avenue including detail of level of obscurity which would be obscurity level 3. The changes shown on the deposited plans also include the two new windows approved under non material amendment application 23/02364/NMA.\r\rAssessment\r\rThe changes to the side elevation windows approved under outline planning application 19/01873/OUT are considered to be both individually and cumulatively minor in nature. In addition the windows would be non-openable below 1.7 meters above finished floor level and have an obscurity level of 3. It is considered that the proposal would not \r\r-change the quantum or nature of development approved:\r- materially change the character and appearance of the approved development in a way that would be detrimental to either the character and appearance of the development or surrounding area. \r- cause harm to the residential amenity of existing neighbouring occupiers or future occupants of the development subject of this application\r- result in any highway safety concerns;\r- prejudice fire safety\r- or adversely alter the sustainability and biodiversity of the development approved.\r\rIt is recommended that the changes be accepted and that condition 7 is made a compliance condition and the plans condition 4 is varied to include the new drawings depicting the changes proposed to outline planning permission 19/01873/OUT. \r\rIt is recommended that the conditions attached to outline planning permission 19/01873/OUT are reapplied and modified where appropriate to reflect any condition applications that have been considered and a decision issued since the grant of outline planning permission 19/01873/OUT. \r\rIt is noted that para 14.2 of the legal agreement attached to outline planning permission 19/01873/OUT states that the legal agreement will apply to future reiterations of the approved development subject of a s73 variation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed hip-to-gable would cause a visual imbalance to the adjoining semi-detached property No. 1 Bakewell Way as they do not benefit from a hip-to-gable extension. However, although not common, gable-end extensions can be seen in the vicinity, and the gable end could be constructed under permitted development if considered solely. \r\rThe proposed dormer would generally comply with the guidance in the Residential Design SPD (Dormer Windows) by maintaining 500mm from the eaves, sides and ridge. Additionally, this could generally be constructed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution. In addition, in the context of other houses in the wider area, this form of construction would not be unusual.\r\rThe applicant proposed a single-storey rear/side extension that would have a depth of approximately 3m from the rear elevation and a part-flat, part-pitched roof totalling approximately 4m in height with a eave height of approximately 2.9m. The extension would have a reasonable setback from the front elevation of approximately 4m; therefore, it would not be starkly visible in the street scene. Overall, the single-storey extension would appear subordinate and proportionate to the host dwelling. \r\rOn balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which does not sufficiently set out which policy criteria is not relevant to the development and why. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
