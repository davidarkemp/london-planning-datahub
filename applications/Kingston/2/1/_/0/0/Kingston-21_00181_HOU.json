    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting and roof form of the proposed addition, would be an incongruous and visually jarring feature within the Coombe Lane West street Scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the siting and roof form of the proposed addition, would fail to preserve the setting of a grade II* listed building, resulting in less than substantial harm to its significance. This harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Condition 14 (Surface Water Drainage Scheme) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\rNo development shall commence, other than demolition, within a Development Plot or Phase until a detailed surface water drainage scheme for that Development Plot or Phase, has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The scheme shall subsequently be implemented in accordance with the approved details before the development is completed. \r\rReason: To ensure a sustainable drainage system is implemented to manage the increased risk of flooding, to improve and protect water quality and improve habitat and amenity.\r\rCondition 15 (Surface Water Drainage Scheme) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\rDevelopment shall not commence, other than demolition, in any Development Plot or Phase until a related drainage strategy detailing any on and/or off-site drainage works for that Phase has been submitted and approved in accordance with the approved Drainage Strategy Report. \r\rReason: To ensure a sustainable drainage system is implemented and that sufficient capacity is made available to cope with the new development to avoid adverse environmental impacts upon the community.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted information in relation to Conditions 14 and 15 for Plot C Phase 1 is considered to be sufficient. It is noted that the Council's Flood Risk Officer raised no objections to the proposal.\r\rAs such, details submitted for Conditions 14 and 15 in relation to Plot C Phase 1 only are hereby approved.\r\r",
    "The proposed loft and roof plans are labelled as approved plans, please revise the proposed plans with correct labelling.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non-material amendment to planning permission ref 22/01359/FUL which was granted on 24.08.2023. The proposed amendments would see the rewording of Condition 2 (Approved Plans) to reflect proposed design revisions, including: \r\r- Change of material for the canopy to the Community Hub and Block B Residential Entrance from aluminium clad solid canopies to glass; \r- A new canopy to the south elevation of Block A at the entrance door; and \r- Changes to the roof design on the east and western elevations of Block A from a pitched roof to a flat roof.\r\rNo changes are proposed to the north and south elevations of the building or the ridge height. The green roof will also be maintained. \r\rCouncil's Urban Design Officer has reviewed the proposed design changes and has not raised any objection to the proposed new solid canopy on Block A however, noted that no details have been provided on the proposed materials. Officers would accept the canopy to be constructed of the same material as the soffits to the balcony. \r\rCouncil's Urban Design Officer raised concerns about the flattening of the pitched roof on Block A. When viewed from the western elevation and from higher surrounding buildings (i.e. Block B), the flat roof will look out of place with the form of the approved building and the retention of the parapet roof ends would be visually jarring with the building's architectural quality. Concerns were also raised about the proposed changes to Block B stating the proposed changes to the canopy material are not considered seamless and will have limited benefit on natural lighting. Glass requires more maintenance, is less robust and the fixings required as indicated in the drawings, will add further out-of-character fussiness to the clean edged building. Officers consider the changes to Block A's roof and material of Block B's canopy will be incongruous with the architectural style of the approved buildings, contrary to Para 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy CS8 and DM10 and DM11 of Kingston's Core Strategy (2012). \r\rParagraph 140 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) states local planning authorities should seek to ensure that the quality of approved development is not materially diminished between permission and completion, as a result of changes being made to the permitted scheme. \r\rThe proposed amendments would materially diminish the quality of the approved development in terms of design quality. As such, Officers consider the amendments to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the S96A application be refused.",
