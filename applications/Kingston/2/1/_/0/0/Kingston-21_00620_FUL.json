  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development a hot food take-away would be within 400 mteres of Burlington Junior School. As such the proposed development would be in conflict with London Plan Policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) 2021 that states development proposals containing A5 hot food takeaway uses should not be permitted where these are within 400 metres walking distance from the entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school.",
    "The proposal is in a designated Local Centre. The loss of the retail unit would result in a reduction in retailing premises (E(a) use, formerly A1) in the wider Local Centre, which in turn would harm the vibrancy and viability of the centre. The proposal is contrary to Policy DM 19 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy E9 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "There are discrepancies between the elevation plans and the floor plans - the distance between the rear outrigger and the property boundary is different when measured on both plans. As such, an assessment of the impact of the proposed extraction system on the upper window of the unit, in terms of outlook / noise, is not possible. As such, there is insufficient information to conclude that the development would not been harmful to the amenities of the occupants of the upper floor of the unit. The development is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIt should also be noted that floor plans of the upper floor have not been submitted with the application."
