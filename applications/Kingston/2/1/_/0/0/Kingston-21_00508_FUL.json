  "description": "Demolition of existing brick built bin store within the development site and erection of replacement timber structure bin store and erection of timber/metal structure cycle store at another location within the site",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and design of the proposed bin store, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Villiers Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is located on the south side of Cotsford Avenue, New Malden. The site is occupied by a detached bungalow on a rectangular-shaped plot. The plot includes a large garden to the rear and a front garden that includes trees and hedges.\r\rNeighbour Consultations\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals; 4 objections have been receivedÂ within the deadline of the consultationÂ period and 1 objection has been receivedÂ outside the consultation period, therefore, this application will be consideredÂ by the local planning authority. The objections receivedÂ relate to the following:\r\rÂ - Access or traffic problemsÂ \r - Car park issues\rÂ - Effects on trees\rÂ - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\rÂ - Inappropriate design/layoutÂ \r - Loss of light/Sunlight\rÂ - Privacy\r\rAll concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r-Â 22/03912/HOU -Â Erection of single storey rear, front porch and side extension. Erection of roof extension and installation of 2nos front. 2nos rear and 3nos side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Relocation of main entrance door. grantedÂ 24.08.2023\r\r- 21/01049/FUL - Demolition of the existing dwelling and erection of a two storey dwelling house. Refused on 02.07.2021. Appeal Dismissed 30.02.2022.\r\r- 21/00050/HOU - Erection of part single, part two storey side and rear extensions, rear dormer roof extension with installation of 13no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration. Refused on 22.03.2021\r\rProposalÂ \rDemolition of an existing side conservatory, erection of part two storey/part single storey rear and side, single storey front porch extension. Roof alteration with first floor front extension, 1no front dormer and increase in roof height. Installation of 3nos side rooflights.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Trees\r- Highways\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:Â \rSingle Storey Rear Extension\rThe proposed ground floor rear extension would have a total width of approximately 15m spanning beyond the existing rear elevation and would have a depth of 4m from the rear wall. This would be larger than what was granted under planning application ref: 22/03912/HOU, as the rear extension approved under that application would only span the width of the existing rear elevation (10.8m) and would have a depth of approximately 3.8m, 200m less than what is currently proposed. Offices acknowledge that the rear extension would still have a proposed total height of 3.6m with eaves that sit at 2.8m from ground level and it would not be visible from the streetscene. However, the proposal wouldÂ further close the gap between the neighbouring properties; the separation distance from No.9 Cotsford AveÂ would be approximately 390mm and the distance from the boundary shared with No.13 Cotsford Ave would be approximately 1.4m.Â \r\rFirst Floor Rear ExtensionÂ \rThe proposed first-floor rear extension solely would fall in line with PolciyÂ Guidance 34, of the Residential DesignÂ SPD; it would maintain adequate distance between the neighbouring properties, the proposed pitched roof would respect theÂ pitchedÂ roof of the existing dwelling and would not be visible from the streetscene.\r\rSide ExtensionsÂ \rThe proposed single-storey side extension on the eastern flank would be approximately 16.3m in depth with an eaves height of 2.8m which integrates withÂ the proposed rear extension. Whilst officers acknowledgeÂ that side extensions are not incongruous in the immediate vicinityÂ of Cotsford Avenue, the proposal would involve the reduction of the separation distance between no.9 Cotsford Avenue towards the front elevation.Â \r\rThe western two-storey/single-storey side extension would maintain approx 1.4m from the boundary shared with No.13 Cotsford Avenue, this is similar to what was granted under planning permission ref: 22/03912/HOU, however, the proposal now involves a two-storey element rather than just single storey, giving the proposal a more prominent appearance in the streetscene. Overall, the proposed side extensions would have a prominent appearanceÂ in the streetscene, due to width and height.\r\rRoof Extensions\rAlthoughÂ officers acknowledgeÂ the applicant'sÂ efforts in incorporatingÂ the pitched roof form of the existing dwelling into the proposal, the proposed roof alterations would not capture this sufficiently, rather the roof alteration would look irregular and would have a further disrupted ymmetry, therefore appearing incongruousÂ in the streetscene.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 25 and 45-degree rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.Â \r\rThe application site has No. 9 Cotsford Avenue to the eastern flank, No. 13 Cotsford Avenue to the western flank, and the closest to the rear of the dwelling is No. 24d Bazalgette Gardens.\r\rThe building is located approximately 1.2m from the boundary shared with neighbouring property No.13 Cotsford Avenue and would have a varied distance of approximately 390mm distance from the boundary shared with No.9 Cotsford Avenue, meeting the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 35. This states that proposed extensions should be set in from the boundary by at least 250mm so that guttering does not overhang adjoining land.\r\rGiven these separation distances in regards to No.7 No.15 Cotsford Avenue and 24d Bazalgette Gardens, the proposal is not considered to be overbearing or to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight for these neighbours. Concerning No. 9 Cotsford Avenue, whilst officers acknowledge that the proposed side extension would no longer have a similar depth as the existing dwelling on No.9, the proposal would not breach the 45-degree rule, therefore, the proposal is not considered to be overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to the closest habitable space at No.9.\r\rThe applicant proposes to further reduce the gap shared between themselves and No.13 Cotsford AvenueÂ and also introduce a two-storey side extension. Officers note the window at No.13 facing the proposed site, however, this window serves a bathroom/utility room and, therefore, is not considered a habitable room.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comments: Our records identify 2 on-site Cypress Trees and 6 off-site trees which include an apple and a plum tree on No.9 Cotsford Avenue, a Purple Leaf Plum Tree and a Willow Tree located in the garden of No.13 Cotsford Avenue and 2 street trees which are an Apple Tree and a Cherry Tree. The applicant has not submitted a Tree Protection Plan or Arboricultural Impact Assessment Plan, therefore, an appropriate assessment of the effects of the proposed can not be sufficiently considered.\r\rIn the absence of the requested information, it cannot be determined that no harm to, or loss of, retained trees which contribute positively to the character of the area would occur.\r\rHighwaysÂ \rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards of up to 1.5 car park spaces for dwellings with 3+ bedrooms, as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comments: The proposed plans show the removal of the existing garage., officers note that the garage fails to meet the minimum requirements for garage dimension (current dimensions are 3.2m width x 3.7m depth (standard requirement: 3.0m width x 5.4m depth). It is noted that the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide 2 adequate car parking spaces. Removal of the garage would also remove the potential for storing in the garage, however, access to the rear would allow for cycles to be safely stored.\r\rTherefore, officers consider the proposal would not have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Condition 19 (Flood Management Plan/Emergency Response Plan) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\rPrior to the occupation in each Development Plot or Phase, a Flood Management Plan/Emergency Response Plan shall be produced and submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing in accordance with the Flood Risk Assessment April 2021 recommendations.
