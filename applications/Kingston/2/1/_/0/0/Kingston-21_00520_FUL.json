  "decision_conditions": [
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows above ground floor level in the side elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Lime Grove, Local Area of Special Character.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed dormer would not generally comply with the guidance in the Residential Design SPD (Dormer Windows) in regard to maintaining 500mm from the eaves, sides and ridge. However, it could be constructed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution. In addition, in the context of other houses in the wider area, this form of construction would not be unusual.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed hip-to-gable would cause a visual imbalance to the adjoining neighboring property No. 65 Poplar Grove, as they do not benefit from a hip-to-gable extension. However, as mentioned above the proposed roof extension could mostly be constructed under permitted development (were the higher ridgeline to be constructed first).\r\rThe applicant previously submitted an application with a similar proposal; for a part two-storey, part single-storey rear extension under planning permission ref: 24/00935/HOU .  Although it was granted officers acknowledged that adding the proposed two-storey rear extension would add additional bulk at the rear. The applicant now proposes to further widen this part of the extension to the full width of the rear elevation and this extension would also extend beyond the two-storey rear extension at No.65 Poplar Grove by approximately 1.6m. This would be unacceptable regarding character and appearance as it would appear more bulky than what was initially approved. Additionally, the proposed flat roof of the two-storey extension would not relate well to the host property and would fall outside the requirements of Policy Guidance 34, of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high-quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would not generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD, it would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and this type of development would be incongruous in the immediate vicinity. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would result in any harm to the Lime Grove, Local Area of Special Character.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The effects of this proposal on amenities would not significantly differ when comparing the proposed development against the existing layout. Officers acknowledge the window on the second floor at No. 69 Poplar Grove, however, given that this window serves a stairway/landing (a non-habitable room) it is not considered that the proposed development would have any unacceptable adverse impact on daylight received at neighbouring habitable rooms.\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
