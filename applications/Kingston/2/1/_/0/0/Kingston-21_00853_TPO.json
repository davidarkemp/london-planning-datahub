    "Any replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased, shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\r\rAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\r\rThe applicant is advised that the following would be suitable species:\r\r(a) Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides)\r(b) Tulip Tree (Liriondendron tulipifera)\r(c) River Birch (Betula nigra)",
    "We have received only one existing and proposed side elevation, we require both side (right and left) elevations. Please provide all Existing and Proposed Side (Right and Left) Elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non material amendment to planning permission ref. no  22/02799/HOU to extend first floor to side to align with external walls at ground floor level along boundary with 21 Grove Crescent.\r\rOfficers considered the amendments to be material and would require an additional assessment on the character, appearance and amenity of the proposal and would therefore require a S73 application to amend the original permission.\r\r"
