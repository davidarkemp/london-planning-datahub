    "The excessive depth, the parapet roof form and lantern roof light would not relate well to the existing dwelling and would occupy a prominent position resulting in a discordant frontage within the street scene. The proposed extension would appear incongruous within the street scene and would fail to respect, maintain or enhance the character of the area, contrary to the Kingston Residential Design SPD (2013), Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and is covered by an area Tree Protection order (TPO). The Coombe Hill Conservation Area encompasses the estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course. The spacious landscaped setting contributes to the significance of the Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing pool house and erection of a single storey pool house, plant room and bar.\r\rThis application follows recently refused application 23/01096/HOU dated 04.07.2023 which was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1) The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area due to the loss of/harm to mature trees which contribute positively to the significance of the Conservation Area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021).\r\r2) The proposals require the removal of mature trees and the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not also result in harm to the health and longevity of other trees covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area. The proposal would not accord with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rand also refused application 23/02582/HOU dated 21.11.2023 which was refused for the following reason\r\r1) The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area due to the loss of/harm to mature trees which contribute positively to the significance of the Conservation Area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2023).\r\r2) The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of trees of amenity value covered by a tree protection order through damage to the Root Protection Areas. The proposal would not accord with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rBoth reasons for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful.\r\rConsultation\r7 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rMalden and Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objection\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer - Officer is satisfied with the information submitted and raises no objection or suggested conditions.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the Coombe Wood Conservation Area; \r- The impact of the development on Tree Preservation Orders; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed pool house would be acceptable with regards to scale, appearance and shape. It is considered that no harm to, or loss of trees of amenity value would occur resulting in an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. Therefore, reason one for refusal has been fully addressed.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the The Coombe Hill Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above, the information submitted is acceptable to the Tree & Landscape Officer and the previous issues raised in relation to harm to, or of loss of, trees of amenity value have been fully addressed. Therefore, it is considered that the applicant has demonstrated through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of trees covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
