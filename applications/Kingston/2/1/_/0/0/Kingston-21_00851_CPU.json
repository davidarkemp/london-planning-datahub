    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope falls within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Please submit a Planning Fire Safety Strategy. The PFSS should address all aspects of part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021 and should include a statement of competence. It should also reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), and where applicable, a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) should be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant. The RES template can be found on Page 31 of the London Plan guidance https://www.london.gov.uk/sites/default/files/fire_safety_lpg_consultation_version_-_planning_11_feb_22.pdf",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non-material amendment to planning permission ref 22/01359/FUL which was granted on 24.08.2023. The submitted Application Form confirms the description of non-material amendments sought are to vary the wording of Condition 25 (Fire Statement) which requires the Fire Strategy Report (prepared by BWC, dated 24.01.2024, Issue 4) and Fire Statement (prepared by BWC, dated 25.01.2023, Issue B) to be implemented prior to the occupation of the building. The Applicant confirmed that during the detailed design process, it was identified that the approved Fire Statement, which indicated Hawks Road as the access point for both blocks, did not meet the allowable distance requirements for firefighting access to Block B. To address this, the submitted updated Fire Statement (prepared by MSC Fire, dated 18.02.2025) proposes the use of Washington Road for emergency vehicle access to the fire fighting stairs of Block B. The submitted Fire Strategy Plan confirms vehicle access can be accommodated on site. No changes are proposed for Block A. \r\rDuring pre-application discussions for the proposed scheme, Council's Highways Team were consulted and raised no objection to the proposed fire tender access arrangement. The Applicant for the adjoining Cambridge Road Estate redevelopment  was also consulted and provided in principle support for the proposed amendment. Officers are supportive of the proposed changes to the fire safety access arrangement as compliance with the Building Regulations and Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021 has been demonstrated. \r\rThe revised fire tender access results in additional amendments to Condition 2 (approved plans and documents) of planning permission 22/01359/FUL as detailed below. These proposed changes were not detailed in the Application Form. \r\r- Relocation of the cycle storage to the edge of the approved outdoor amenity and play space area \r- Relocation and widening of private access gate \r- Loss of one tree (Betula pendula) and low-level planting to accommodate the fire tender vehicle access and relocated cycle storage area\r\rThe hard and soft landscaping details for Condition 23 of planning permission 22/01359/FUL were discharged on 24.07.2024 (24/00622/CLC). Council's Tree and Landscape Officer was consulted about the proposed amendments to the approved landscaping scheme and requested the tree (Betula pendula) and planter bed be replaced elsewhere on-site. During the course of the application, a revised plan General Arrangement Landscape Plan was submitted which identified the Betula pendula would be replaced on the southern boundary within the communal amenity area. The revised Landscape Plan shows the planter bed would not be replaced. No revised Planting Strategy (drawing no. 2114-CAM-03-ZZ-DR-L-0071 REV C04) or Tree Protection Plan (drawing no. 2114-CAM-03-ZZ-DR-L-0081 REV C06) was submitted. High quality landscaping is integral to the approved scheme given the number of trees being lost on site to accommodate the proposal and the constrained size of the communal outdoor amenity space. This was confirmed by the Design Review Panel in 2021 and again by members at the Planning Committee. Loss of landscaping impacts other factors integral to the approved development, including biodiversity net gain secured under Condition 57 and 58 of the original planning permission and Urban Greening Factor Score (drawing no. L025-P-004) secured under Condition 30. This has not been considered by the Applicant. \r\rThe cycle parking details discharged for Condition 35 of planning permission 22/01359/FUL on 19.06.2024 under 23/02726/CLC identifies 2 cycle stands and a secure cycle storage for 14 bikes would need to be relocated to accommodate the fire tender access. The submitted documents only showed how the secure cycle storage would be reprovided on site and not the cycle stands. The revised General Arrangement Landscape Plan submitted during the course of the application shows how the cycle stands would be reprovided on site however, this detail would also need to be provided on a revised General Arrangement - Furniture & Fixtures Plan (drawing no. 2114-CAM-03-ZZ-DR-L-0091 REV C02) as well as the submitted Sitewide Fire Strategy Plan (drawing no. 2114-5PA-67-Z00-DR-A-501). The principle of the relocated cycle parking is supported in principle however, needs to be considered in relation to the above matters and the requirement for there to be no loss in landscaping. \r\rParagraph 140 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 states local planning authorities should seek to ensure that the quality of approved development is not materially diminished between permission and completion, as a result of changes being made to the permitted scheme. \r\rThe proposed amendments result in the loss of a planter bed which would materially diminish the quality of the approved development in terms of landscaping, biodiversity net gain and urban greening factor. As such, Officers consider the amendments to be non-material and it is recommended that the S96A application be refused."
