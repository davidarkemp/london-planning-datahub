    "It has not been demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that the cubic content of the resulting roof space of the proposed roof extensions, together with the existing roof extensions (not being part of the original house) would not exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. Therefore the proposed development would fail to comply with paragraph B1.(d) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",

The same penalties as those for contravening an Order apply .\r\rSection 201 (2) of the Town and Country Planning Act provides that anyone found guilty of these offences is liable , if convicted in the magistrates' court, to a fine of up to £20,000. In serious cases a person may be committed for trial in the Crown Court and, if convicted, is liable to an unlimited fine . Section 210 (3) provides that, in determining the amount of fine, the court shall take into account any financial benefit which has resulted, or is likely to result, from the offence. \r\rAnyone found guilty in the magistrate' court of an office under section 210 (4) is liable to a fine of up to Level 4 (currently £2,500) \r"
