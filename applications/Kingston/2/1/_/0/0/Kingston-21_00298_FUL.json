    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a commercial building in the designated Surbiton District Centre on Victoria Road. \r\rConsultation \rNeighbour response - 2 responses received in support of the application.\r\rSCAAC No Objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign & Heritage\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area (including Conservation Area) as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe application is supported by a noise assessment and the proposal has been reviewed by the LPA's Environmental Health Pollution Control Officer and found to be acceptable with no objection raised subject to a condition recommended to control noise levels from plant proposed. \r\rOther matters \rThe application is supported by a fire statement. A condition is recommended to secure that the proposal would be carried out in accordance with and thereafter maintained/operated as such with the deposited fire statement to accord with London Plan Policy D12.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 4 (written scheme of investigation) of planning permission 22/01387/HOU which state:\r\rNo demolition or development shall take place until a stage 1 written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, and the programme and methodology of site evaluation and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.\r\rIf heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 then for those parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing.

Condition 16 is a compliance condition and would only need discharging in the event that contamination is found (at any time) that was not previously identified. The applicant must confirm if any new contamination has been identified.\r\rSummary\rA number of conditions have been submitted under a single cover. As such, whilst elements of the submission are acceptable, the application as a whole, due to insufficient information submitted in relation to Conditions 3 and 12,  is refused.'",
    "The RBK's Flood Risk Officer shared the following comments:\rThe LLFA do not recommend the discharge of this condition because more clarity and further information is required.\r\rThe Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) provided by the Environment Agency shows that the site lies in an area of medium risk of surface water flooding (meaning there is between 1% and 3.3% likelihood of flooding occurring in a given year). An online version of this mapping data is available to view through the Environment Agency's Long term flood risk information mapping.\r\rThe applicant proposes to discharge surface water at the Thames Water surface water sewer at a restricted rate of 1 l/s as shown in the submitted drainage strategy drawing. As required, the applicant has provided a geotechnical ground investigation report to justify not discharging surface water via infiltration in compliance to the drainage hierarchy owing to site geology and high groundwater conditions. In the approved application (23/02331/FUL), SuDS in the form of a tanked permeable block paving and a water butt was being proposed and approved to attenuate flow. A vortex flow control device is incorporated to restrict discharge rate to proposed rates. However, in this application, it is not clear if these SuDS are still being proposed, as it is not shown in the drainage layout and or drainage calculations. This should be clarified.\r\rAs required, drainage calculations that demonstrate that the proposed drainage system can contain up to the 1 in 30 year storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event can be safely contained on site has been provided. Calculations include the total site area which contributes to the drainage system.\r\rA sustainable drainage layout has been provided, to show the location of the proposed components and the connectivity of the system. The layout as required also shows pipe numbers, gradients and pipe sizes. However, the submitted drainage layout does not show any proposed SuDS component. Therefore, it is not clear whether or not initially proposed SuDS (permeable pavings and water butts) are being proposed.\r\rAs required by this condition, a maintenance plan is required; it should include what maintenance tasks will be completed, who will be responsible for undertaking maintenance and how often the maintenance tasks will be completed.\r\rThe LLFA do not recommend the discharge of this condition because we need clarity on the sustainable drainage systems that have been proposed (to ensure that the drainage system has been completed as approved (23/02331/FUL)).\r",

    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.
