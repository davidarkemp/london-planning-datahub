    "The building, on 29th May 2013, was not used for a use falling within Class B1(a) of the Schedule to the Use Classes Order. Therefore, the building does not benefit from the rights afforded by Class O of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In the absence of a signed and suitably worded unilateral undertaking to preclude future occupants of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits, the proposed development would resulting in inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets, which would, in turn, compromise highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate levels of natural light would be provided in all habitable rooms of the proposed dwellinghouses.",
    "Please submit time stamp photo. it is validation requirement.",
    "The submitted existing and proposed floor plans, elevations, roof plans and site plan do not have scale bar, please revise all the drawings with correct scale bar.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Subdivision of a single house into 2nos of flats. Erection part two storey/part single storey rear, single storey side extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer.'",
    "Inspection:Site inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\rAssessment: The works proposed are acceptable and will not have an adverse effect on the trees or reduce there amenity value. \rRecommendation: Approve tree surgery works  \r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey infill rear extension\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed works would not be visible within the streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:The principal properties to be considered with regard to neighbouring amenity are No. 3 and No. 7 Dysart Avenue. Due to the existing situation on site, no harm has been identified to No. 3 Dysart Avenue. Officers note that No. 7 Dysart Avenue does not benefit from a rear extension but does have a glass roof structure that covers the patio. There is currently a tall parapet wall on the boundary  shared betweenNo. 7 and No. 5 Dysart Avenue from the existing conservatory. The proposed infill extension along the boundary with No. 7 would only extend by 3.6m from the original rear elevation in line with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 14 (Remedial Strategy) of planning permission 20/00825/FUL which state:\r\rPrior to commencement of the development of any above ground development (excluding  demolition) the applicant shall provide a scheme to the Local Planning Authority for its written  approval detailing sound transmission reduction measures to be installed between the:\r\r(a) the separating walls and separating floor / ceiling constructions of the flats hereby permitted\r(b) the separating walls of the house (marked HO.1 on Proposed Ground Floor Plan ref:  A11374D0100) and ground floor office\r(c) the separating walls of the houses hereby permitted\r(d) the ground floor retail units and the first floor flats\r\rto limit airborne and impact sound transmission. The scheme shall be designed to be 5dB better than that given in Approved Document E (2003 Edition incorporating 2004 and 2010 amendments) of the Building Regulations (Table 0.1a, page 12). Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of future residential occupiers in accordance with Policy  DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r"
