    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and 2.5 Coombe Hill Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rThe site is covered by a TPO group order.\r\rProposal \rErection of three storey side, single storey front and rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r15 properties were notified of the proposal.  Two representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Effects on trees\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed with this report. \r\rRelevant Planning History - 24/01418/PAEXT Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height of 2.9m) - prior approval not required 13.08.2024\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised within the written representations regarding the proposed bulk and mass of the side extension.\r\rHowever, due to the proposed set back from the front elevation (approximately 0.9m), set down distance from the existing roof line, set in distance form the common boundary as well as the proposed width of the extension and design, it is considered that the proposed 3 storey side extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Notwithstanding the submitted details of the materials, a relevant condition requesting further details of the proposed materials (colour, materiality/manufacturer details) would be added to ensure satisfactory appearance of the completion of development in an event of approval. \r\rThe proposed front extension, due to its modest scale, siting and the proposed design is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding properties.. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension given the proposed depth of approximately 3m and height of approximately 2.6m is considered to appear as a subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposed flat roof over this extension must not be used as a roof terrace/balcony, which would be secured via condition.\r\rOfficers note the existing, protected trees adjoining the site boundaries. The protected trees  make a positive and valuable contribution to the quality of the public realm within Morecoombe Close and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area and in absence of any information demonstrating the impact of the proposal on the protected trees, it is considered that the potential loss of such trees as a result of the development would not be acceptable and would harm the overall character and appearance of the area. \r\rOfficers note the recent planning history and the approved application ref no  24/01418/PAEXT for  Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height of 2.9m).\r\rThe applicant is reminded that implementing this development in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful. This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. The applicant is strongly advised to seek further advice before proceeding with any approval.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised within the written representation regarding the potential loss of privacy and overbearing appearance as a result of the proposal. \r\rIt is noted that there are no proposed openings in the side elevation of the proposal. Due to the siting of the proposal it is considered that it would not result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or an undue overlooking in relation to the adjoining property Holyoke.\r\rGiven the mature trees along the common boundary with Holyoke and the separation distances and siting of the proposed side extension, it is considered that it would not appear as an overbearing when viewed from this adjoining property or Hertcombe, George Road.\r\rGiven the separation distances to the adjoining property to the rear, Silverwoood House, the proposal is not considered to adversely affect the amenities of its occupiers. Due to the siting and modest scale of the proposed rear extension, it is considered not to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers at the adjoining property No 6. The proposed flat roof area over the rear extension must not be used as a roof terrace, which would be secured via condition. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Tree Plan, however it does not capture all the protected trees that would be affected by the proposal, for example the existing trees along the common boundary with Holyoke which root protection zones are likely to be affected by the proposed 3 storey side extension. \r\rIt is noted that the RBK's Trees Officer has raised objection to the proposal.\r\rAs such, the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of robust evidence that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the protected trees which contribute towards the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.\r\rArchaeology\rThe application site is situated within the Archaeological Priority Areas - Tier 2. According to the archaeological risk model provided by Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service, any householder developments situated within the Tier 2 Archaeological Priority Area are posing negligible risk, which means developments only rarely causing harm to heritage assets of archaeological interest and hardly ever causing significant harm.\r\rAs such, due to the  scale of the proposal and its siting, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in significant harm to heritage assets of archaeological interest. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and drawing FP01 Proposed Fire Plan, which are considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
