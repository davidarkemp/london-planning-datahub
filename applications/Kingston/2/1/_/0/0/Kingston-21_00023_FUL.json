    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the application site that would be dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive in the views of the site from the rear of the residential properties in Tolworth Broadway and Oakleigh Avenue. It would not be in keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 \r",
    "The size, siting and design and proximity of the proposed development in relation to the rear windows of the residential properties in Tolworth Broadway would impede the outlook of the residential properties on the upper floors of the Tolworth Broadway to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm the daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers. Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
