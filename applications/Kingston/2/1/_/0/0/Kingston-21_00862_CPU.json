    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with the addition of three roof lights to the front roof slope to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of garage and single storey side extension and erection of single storey side extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension to replace the existing garage would not be set back from the front elevation, contrary to Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Given the proposed scale, together with the lack of setback from the front elevation and the proposed flat roof form, the proposal is considered to appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed brickwork to the front elevation, given the proposed eaves height would be much higher that the existing brickwork on the host dwelling, creating yet another visual discrepancy. Whilst this is the existing situation, the ancillary garage is considerably setback and therefore less prominent in the street scene.  The proposed design treatment is not considered appropriate for a home extension that should appear as an integral part of the house.\r\rGiven the proposed width of the extension, that would exceed more than half width of the original dwelling and its height, the proposal may require a greater set back from the front elevation than the recommended minimum of 50cm.\r\rIt should be noted that the extension should be set in from the boundary by at least 250mm so guttering would not overhang the existing land. \r\rOfficers note the existing street scene and the existing single storey side extensions that vary in form and design, some of them have unclear planning history.  However, it appears that the characteristic roof form in Orme Road is pitched roof and flat roof forms are characteristic to the side garages. \r\rOverall, the proposed side extension due to its design and siting, with no set back from the front elevation and the proposed roof form, would  fail to appear subordinate  or proportionate to the host dwelling  and would be an incongruous addition to the host dwelling. As such, the proposal would result in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building  and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 35 of the SPD of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposed depth of the extension would be similar to the existing one. \r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at the ground floor level at both adjoining properties and therefore it would not adversely affect the levels of daylight received in these properties. \r\rDue to the modest depth of the proposal and its siting it is not considered to appear as an overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties. \r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
