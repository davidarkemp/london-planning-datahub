    "Due to the siting, scale, mass and form of the proposed two storey side extension, the proposed development would fresult in an incongruous and bulky addition to the host property and would not visually integrate with the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Given the scale and siting of the proposed two storey side extension in relation to the shared boundary, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of loss of light into the habitable rooms of No. 275 South Lane,  thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
