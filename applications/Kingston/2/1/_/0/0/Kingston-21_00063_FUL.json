  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed three storey dwellings would, by virtue of their excessive height and bulk, be a discordant feature which would compete with neighbouring properties, resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Oakhill Conservation Area. The proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Oakhill Conservation Area, contrary to Policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021), the NPPF (2019) and Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act, 1990 Act.",
    "No mechanism to preclude residents of the proposed development from applying for on street residents parking permits (including visitor permits) and for permits to park in Council-owned car parks in the area has been submitted. Furthermore, no up to date or proposal specific evidence or information has been submitted to allow a full assessment of the highways and parking impacts of the proposal. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not increase on-street car parking stress and would not have an adverse impact on highway safety, contrary to paragraph 109 of the NPPF (2019) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "No mechanism to secure a waste and recycling strategy has been submitted. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed dwellings would be adequately serviced so as to avoid an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and inconvenience to the occupants of the proposed dwellings, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThis retrospective application relates to the land attached to No. 15 High Street New Malden. The site is located within the New Malden District Centre on the south west corner of High Street and Grafton Way.\r\rThe area is characterised by a wide range of retail, office and other town centre uses with a prevailing building height of between 1 and 3 stories.\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 4 - good. The property is not listed and is not located within a conservation area.\r\rProposal \r(Retrospective) Erection of a single storey side extension to create office space Use Class E(g)(i). \r\rConsultations\r18 properties were notified of the proposal. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle of development\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rRelevant Planning History\r19/01965/FUL Erection of single storey side extension to create new office space together with the erection of external staircase - Granted on 29.10.2019 \r\r15/14630/FUL Erection of single storey side extension to create new office space - Granted on 18/08/2105\r\r12/14110/FUL Use of ground floor as A3 (restaurant and cafes) with installation of mechanical ventilation duct and access ramp to rear - Refused on 29/05/2012, Appeal Allowed on 08/04/2013\r\rPrinciple of Development\rOfficers note the recent planning history for the site and previous planning permissions for the proposal (Use Class E Office Use) that were not implemented within the given timeframe (as per Condition 2 planning permission 19/01965/FUL). \r\rWhile this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rPolicy CS11 (Economy and Employment) states that the Council will, where appropriate, support the provision of flexible business space to meet the diverse needs of start up, micro, small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), including new and emerging sectors, e.g. green industries.\r\rPolicy DM18 (New Employment Uses) states that the Council will consider applications for new employment development (of an appropriate scale) in designated employment locations favourably.\r\rPolicy CS12 (Retail and Town Centres) seeks to enhance the vitality and viability of New Malden, Surbiton and Tolworth District Centres so that they complement the role of Kingston Town Centre and remain the focus for 'walk to' services, shopping and other town centre uses of an appropriate scale for the size of the centre, e.g. business and employment, culture, community uses, entertainment, farmers and street markets, policing, leisure and housing (including affordable housing), and continue to provide employment opportunities.\r\rThe policies continue on to state that the Council will seek to protect and enhance Local Centres (as designated on the LDF Proposals Map) and local convenience shops so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods and services. Units must be of a suitable\rscale for:\r- The size of the centre;\r- The catchment area; and\r- Employment opportunities.\r\rThe proposed new office Use Class E(g)(i)  would provide additional employment space in the form of a new office unit of 50.5 square metres and would provide 4 full time and 2 part time jobs between the hours of 8am - 6pm Monday to Friday and 8am-1pm on Saturdays. The office would be closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays. It is recommended that a planning condition is imposed to restrict the office opening hours, to ensure that comings and goings from the Office would not disrupt the neighbouring properties.\r\rIt is considered that the office would add to the vitality and viability of New Malden District Centre by providing a new employment use.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current proposal is similar in footprint, height, design and scale to the previously approved schemes. The small amendments to fenestration are noted and are considered to be acceptable. \rThe applicant should note that any advertisement for the application site would require a separate application for advertisement consent. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and scale of the proposal, it is not considered to adversely affect the amenities of the adjoining occupiers in terms of an unacceptable loss of daylight or privacy or an overbearing effect. \r\rThe use of the extension as an additional office unit would not be considered to create a high level of additional noise to the residential flat located above Dominoes Pizza at No. 15. However, to ensure that there is a limited impact on neighbouring residential amenity, it is recommended that a planning condition is imposed requiring the hours of use to be between  8am to 6pm Monday to Friday, and 9am to 1pm on Saturdays.  The office would not be open on Sundays or Bank Holidays.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 4 (good) and is located less than 100 metres away from new Malden Station.  \r\rThe application does not propose any on site car parking, in line with Table 6.2.  Given the application proposes only 50.5 square metres of office floor space and its proximity to New Malden station and High Street, the absence of car parking is considered to be appropriate.\r\rWith regards to the proposed cycle parking, Table 10.2 (The London Plan) recommends provision of 1 long-stay cycle parking spaces, details of which would be secured via a relevant condition. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on highway safety. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy Statement and indicated on the submitted Proposed Ground Floor Plan active and passive fire safety measures, which are considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development.  1 letter of objection received and states : \r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/ layout\r- Loss of light/ sunlight \r\rThese material considerations will be included within the assessment. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of single storey front to the garage, first floor side, single store rear extension, hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front rooflights   \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\r\rPlanning History\r\r24/01922/HOU - Demolition of an existing garage, erection of a part two storey. Part single storey side, single storey rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front rooflights. Refused 14.11.24\r22/02097/CPU - Erection of  hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Approved 22.08.22\r03/16430/FUL - Single storey rear extension. Approved 24.09.03\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the erection of single storey front to the garage, first floor side, single storey rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front rooflights.\r\rOfficers note the applicant has revisited the proposal following the refusal of an earlier application ( ref : 24/01911/HOU) and have addressed a number of the design issues that were set out in the Officers Report. \r \rThe proposed front building line of the proposed single storey front extension to the garage would be aligned with the existing bay window and therefore be compliant with Policy Guidance 38 in the Residential Design SPD.  \r\rWhilst Policy Guidance 36 recommends that a proposed side extension should be set back from the boundary by at least 1m, Officers note the existing garage is positioned hard along the boundary line with neighbouring no24 The Roystons and the proposed side extension continues with this design approach. It is also noted the proposed rear elevation of the side extension would be in alignment  with the existing rear elevation.      \r\rIn terms of the proposed first floor side extension, it would be positioned within the built footprint  of the proposed ground floor side extension. It would be set back from the existing front elevation of the main dwelling by 1m and extend a depth to be aligned with the existing rear elevation. \r\rIn addition, the proposal seeks approval for a hip to gable roof extension in order to facilitate a loft conversion.  Such a change in roof form would upset the symmetry of the  pair of semi detached dwellings, however it is noted there are other examples of such roof arrangements along The Roystons.  Officers note  the proposed  hipped roof arrangement for the side extension would not be set down as per the recommendations set out in Policy Guidance 36, however in this instance would be deemed acceptable.\r\rThe proposed development also includes the erection of a rear dormer.  It would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD in terms of set down from the roof ridge by 500mm, however it would be set in front the sides of the roofslope and would appear a proportionate addition to the host dwelling.\r\rHowever, Officers note  the proposed elevation of the first floor side extension shows a single window yet this has not been reflected on the proposed floor plans.  Should Officers be minded to approve the planning application, the planning permission would be subject to a planning condition  stating that no first floor side elevation windows shall be installed on the proposed side elevation - 1.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site.it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers note the existing garage  is positioned hard along the shared boundary with neighbouring no 26. The proposed block plan shows a similar arrangement yet it  does not reflect the proposed  ground floor plans in respect of the proposed front single storey extension to the garage. Policy Guidance 36 in the Residential Design SPD recommends  that proposed side extensions should be set in from the boundary by at least 1m . On this basis, it is considered that this element of the proposal would be  contrary to Policy Guidance 36. However, Officers note evidence of similar boundary siting arrangements along The Roystons.\r\rOfficers note concern with regard to the loss of natural light  in the side passage  between the neighbouring properties. It is also noted that the  side passage does not serve any windows or doors into the neighbouring property and solely provides a direct access alongside of the dwelling  from the front to the rear and vice versa.\r\rWith regard to neighbouring no 28, it is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to  this neighbour as  the existing building line remains unchanged. \r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  However, the proposed ground floor plan presented within the document does not reflect the proposed ground floor plan  (Drawing Number 202406-HB02) as submitted for determination.  The proposed ground floor plan in the Fire Safety Strategy shows fenestration at ground floor level on the elevation facing towards neighbouring no26 whereas the submitted ground floor plan does not.\r\rOn this basis,  Officers are unable to approve the  submitted Fire Safety Strategy. Should Officers be minded to approve the planning application, the planning permission shall include the appropriate Fire Safety Strategy planning condition to allow for  appropriate details to be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for review and approval in writing  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r"
