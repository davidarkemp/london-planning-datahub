  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposal would result in the introduction of an isolated form of development and would appear, by virtue of its plot subdivision and lack of private ground, as a cramped and contrived form of development and constitute overdevelopment of the application site. The proposed design would not enhance the site, nor would it be of a sufficiently high design standard appropriate for a residential dwelling. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed siting and design of the future amenity space is such that it would result in a reduction to the communal amenity space provided for the use of those flats within No's 12 and 14 Ditton Road. The proposed amenity space would result in a loss of privacy for future occupiers as a result of direct overlooking from those windows to the rear of No's 12-14 Ditton Road in close proximity and, therefore, the proposed development would not accord with Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation and outlook for future occupiers by virtue of the east-facing orientation of the dwelling and predominantly single-aspect and partially sunken layout. In addition, there is no technical Daylight and Sunlight Report to demonstrate adequate daylight and sunlight levels to the proposed dwellinghouse. The external amenity space would be undersized against the criteria set out for new dwellinghouses in the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013. Based on the information submitted, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "No information has been submitted with regards to cycle storage and refuse/recycling storage. In the absence of this information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would provide adequate means of cycle and refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "Given the proposed car-free nature of development and the lack of supporting information in the form of a parking beat survey, the application fails to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, on-street car parking provision in surrounding streets and traffic congestion to the surrounding highway network, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment or Tree Protection Plan to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm to the health and longevity of the nearby large tree located within the rear garden of No. 22 St Matthew's Avenue, contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
