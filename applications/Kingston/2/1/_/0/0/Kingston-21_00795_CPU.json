    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \r(Retrospective) Conversion of an existing outbuilding garage into home office and exercise room.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. \rFour representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use - the outbuilding will be used as a self contained unit of accommodation\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Access or traffic problems\r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as ownership of the site, building regulations or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment. Other concerns will be addressed with this assessment.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the submitted existing plans are in fact the approved plans under the planning permission 20/03300/HOU. The proposal was built and completed as per the submitted plans and photographs of the application site around 2023. \r\rOfficers note the relevant planning history and enforcement records for the application site.\r\rThe proposed outbuilding would be of similar footprint and height to the approved one under planning application ref 20/03300/HOU. The proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.6m (the approved one is approximately 2.5m) and the total height would be of approximately 4.7m (same as the approved one).   \r\rDuring the site visit Officers noted the existing outbuildings, similar in footprint and mass within the surrounding area.  \r\rAs such, considering the proposed design, materials, mass and bulk the proposal is considered to be acceptable from character and appearance perspective. \r\rBased on the submitted information and Officer site visit, the proposed use of the outbuilding would be ancillary to the main dwelling. Officers note provision of bathroom/toilet and kitchen annex within the outbuilding, however this is being used by the occupants of the host dwelling only.\r\rWhile the photographs submitted in support of the proposal, dated 2023, show the rear garden being divided and separated from the main dwelling, which raised neighbours' concerns, the Officer did not observe the physical division of the site during the site visit.\r\rThe applicant should note that any other use of the outbuilding (for example as a self contained unit of accommodation) will require a separate planning permission. In the event of an approval, a planning condition would be added to restrict the use of the outbuilding as ancillary or incidental (or both) to the use of the main dwellinghouse.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns received with the written representations regarding the outbuilding being constructed as a self contained unit of accommodation for rental purposes. \r\rHowever, based on the submitted information and Officer's site visit, the proposal is for an ancillary use to the host dwelling, therefore it would not result in an uncaptable impact on the occupiers of the adjoining properties in terms of issues with car parking or increase in noise levels. \r\rThe proposal, due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the levels of daylight received by the adjoining properties and would not appear as an overbearing.\rHighway Safety\r\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the proposed loss of the garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be still provided within the proposed outbuilding.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy P-100-10, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
