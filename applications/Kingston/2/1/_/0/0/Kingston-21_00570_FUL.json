    "The proposal would result in unacceptable the loss of existing employment floor space which would be contrary to Policy DM17 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "The proposed second floor/roof extension would appear as a bulky and discordant addition that would have a significant adverse effect on the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal fails to comply with National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D3 & D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed unit would not provide satisfactory standards of accommodation for future occupiers due to lack of private amenity space. The proposal is contrary to  Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2021).",
    "The proposal would result in an unacceptable loss of amenity for neighbouring residents by reason of loss of privacy to habitable rooms and private amenity spaces of No.s 2 & 4 Staunton Road. The proposal would therefore result in an unacceptable impact upon residential amenity and would conflict with the NPPF (2019), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy T.4 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).\r",
