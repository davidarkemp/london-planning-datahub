    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its siting, massing, proposed roof form, window design and materials would result in an incongruous and overbearing appearance on the existing street scene. This element of the proposed development would not be proportionate or subordinate and would not relate well to the main dwelling or the surrounding area and it would unbalance the terraced dwellings, thereby conflicting with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8, and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013."
