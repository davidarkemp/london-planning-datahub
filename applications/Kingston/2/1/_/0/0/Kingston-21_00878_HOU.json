    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary, or incidental, or both to the residential use of the main dwelling house at the application site, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK LDF Core Strategy.\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached within the Claremont Road Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: Part of the original Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley. Development started in 1838, and centred around the landscaped Claremont Crescent Gardens.\r\rProposal \rThe  current planning application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established. On such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application. In assessing the application, Officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since granting the original permission. \r\rPermission was granted under  24/01158/HOU dated 2nd August 2024 for the Erection of single storey rear extension and enlargement of the lower-ground floor and existing lightwell. Replacement of all existing windows to double-glazed, conservation-style painted timber sash windows. Installation of side access staircase and change from existing window to new door opening and panelled timber door to the ground floor to the side elevation. New window opening and conservation-style sash window to side elevation. Change from existing side access door opening to new conservation-style sash window to side elevation. Erection of side dormer roof and  replacement rear dormer roof extensions. Installation of timber ASHP and bin enclosure to side garden.\r\rThe proposal seeks variation of condition under S73 of Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 6 (Windows) of planning permission 24/01158/HOU to remove elements of the condition with regards to South aspect and removal of the obscured glazing condition for the North Aspect.\r\rConsultations\r42 surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development and three letters of objection from 2 addresses have been received stating;\r- Privacy\r\rSurbiton CAAC -  No comment/neutral\r - Not relevant to the Conservation Area.\r\rAs noted before the principle of development has already been established as this application  seeks to amend/remove the condition that requires obscure glazing and fixing of  windows below 1.7 metres on the north and south elevations which the applicant states fails to meet the \"Necessity\", \"Reasonableness\" and  \"Relevance to Planning\" Tests and places an unnecessary and  disproportionate restriction on the proposed development. This will be addressed below.\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment :  The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rIt is also therefore considered that there would be no adverse impact on the Claremont Road Conservation Area and  that its significance would be preserved so it is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment:  In order to protect privacy, it was recommended at the time of permission that obscured glazing be used.\r\rParagraph 56 of the National Planning Policy Framework states Local planning authorities should consider whether otherwise unacceptable development could be made acceptable through the use of conditions. Paragraph 57 states that planning conditions should be kept to a minimum and only imposed where they are necessary, relevant to planning and to the development to be permitted, enforceable, precise and reasonable in all other respects \r\rPlanning practice guidance note paragraph 003 states that conditions should only used where they satisfy the following tests:\r\r1. necessary;\r2. relevant to planning;\r3. relevant to the development to be permitted;\r4. enforceable;\r5. precise; and\r6. reasonable in all other respects.\r\rThese are referred to in this guidance as the 6 tests, and each of them need to be satisfied for each condition which an authority intends to apply \r\rWith regards to the 3 tests raised by the applicant  \"Necessity\", \"Reasonableness\" and  \"Relevance to Planning\" \r\rOfficers note the comment regarding necessity in the planning statement, however, overlooking and loss of privacy does not only apply to habitable room windows but also the external amenity space. The proposed glazed panel on the side elevation of the building facing toward the neighbouring property would appear unneighbourly and would create more of  a sense of being overlooked so officers are satisfied that the condition is necessary. With regards to the proposed boundary treatment, it is noted that further details regarding the suitability of this were also secured by condition.\r\rWith regards to reasonableness the applicant states that \"The condition requiring obscure glazing significantly impacts the quality of the living environment within the property by restricting natural light and visual connectivity\" however, it is noted that this is not the only source of natural light into the room as it is also served by windows to the rear elevation. Officers conclude that the condition is therefore reasonable.\r\rIn relation to relevance to planning the applicant states \"The condition appears to address potential privacy concerns that are already adequately managed by the proposed boundary treatments\" however as mentioned the details of this have not been agreed and are also subject to condition. Officers found there to be sufficient planning concern to apply both condition to the decision for this reason.\r\rOverall, officers consider that the condition is necessary and meets the test of paragraph 56 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024. \r\rThe imposition or need for the condition is discussed in the officers report and it is clear that the policies cited in the reason for the condition are clear that all developments should seek to ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the proposed amendments to Condition 6 (Windows) of Planning Permission 24/01158/HOU would diminish the privacy of the neighbouring properties. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed amendment to Condition 6 (Windows) of Planning Permission 24/01158/HOU would diminish the privacy of the neighbouring properties. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy and would therefore fail to ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers\r"
