  "application_type": "Prior Approval",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension would adjoin an existing enlargement that extends beyond a side wall and exceeds half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposal would conflict with Paragraphs A.1 (j) (iii) & (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side and rear extension with rooflights. Erection of rear dormer roof extension with Juliet balcony to extend loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note a number of properties have been extended in a similar fashion. The proposed side extension has been set back from the front elevation. The proposed rear dormer would also not be readily viewable within the streetscene. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear elevation will not extend further than the existing extensions to the properties on either side. No harm has therefore been identified and it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The submitted location plan does not show the land required for access to the site from a public road/ highway. Please revise the red outline in the location plan to show the access from the public road.\rPlease extend the red outline to the main road 'Woodall Close' and submit the correct 'Ownership Certificate in the application form'.\rNote: We do not accept land registry location plan."
