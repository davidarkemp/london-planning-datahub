    "The proposed development by reason of inappropriate design and materials is considered unacceptable and would not relate well to the host dwelling.  The proposed development would also appear incongruous within the streetscene, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. Furthermore, the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 196 of the NPPF, 2019, Policy  D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of accurate and consistent drawings, that the proposed single storey side extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbouring properties, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
