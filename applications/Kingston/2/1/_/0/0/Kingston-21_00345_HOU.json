    "The applicant has not provided a Basement Impact Assessment which should be carried out by an appropriately qualified person.  As such the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed basement would not cause harm to land stability or groundwater sources which would lead to exacerbating existing flood risks. \r\rTherefore the proposal would not accord with the Planning Practice Guidance on Land Stability, paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework and the  policies CS2 and DM4 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to add a rear window at first floor in close proximity to the boundary shared with No.16 Reynolds Road and a floor to ceiling juliet balcony also at first floor level. In this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to the amenity of neighbouring property No.16 and No.18 Reynolds Road and the character and appearance of the wider area.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the application be refused.",
