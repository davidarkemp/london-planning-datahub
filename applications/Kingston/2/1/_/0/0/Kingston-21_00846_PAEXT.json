    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site is located on the corner of Coombe Road and Wolverton Avenue and comprises a mixed use building with commercial uses at ground floor and residential uses on the upper floors. The surrounding area is predominantly residential interspersed by commercial and public health uses. Kingston Hospital lies to the north of the site and the site is opposite Norbiton Rail Station. \r\rThe site is located in the Wolverton Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rThe site is in Flood Zone 1. \r\rThe site has a PTAL rating of 4.\r\rConsultation \r6 objections have been received. Of the 6 only 4 objections were received within the 21 day consultation period. As such the trigger of 5 objections or more is not activated in this instance and a delegated decision has been made. The objections are summarised as follows\r\r- Quality of amenity space\r- Loss of parking/Parking pressures\r- loss of daylight sunlight\r- Overdevelopment\r- Character and appearance \r- Increased height \r- Mass and bulk\r- Harm to LASC\r\rProposal \rErection of roof extensions to create 1no. residential dwelling\r\rThe application has been amended during the course of the application as follows \r- Reduction of dormer \r- reinstatement of off street parking \r- Removal of amenity space proposed\r\rRelevant history\r23/01269/FUL - Erection of roof extension to create 2 residential dwellings - Refused\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Housing Delivery\r- Standard of accommodation\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Highways \r- Cycle parking\r- Fire safety\r\rHousing Delivery \rPolicy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of The London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10-year period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rPolicy H2 (Small Sites) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that Boroughs should proactively support well-designed new homes on small sites (below 0.25 hectares in size) through both planning decisions and plan-making in order to:\r1) significantly increase the contribution of small sites to meeting London's housing needs\r2) diversify the sources, locations, type and mix of housing supply\r3) support small and medium-sized housebuilders\r4) support those wishing to bring forward custom, self-build and community led housing\r5) achieve the minimum targets for small sites set out in Table 4.2 as a component of the overall housing targets set out in Table 4.1.\r\rPolicy CS10 of the Core Strategy (2012) sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan.  Policy H1 of the London Plan 2021 sets a target for the Borough of 9,640 net housing completions within the next ten years, equating to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThe scheme under consideration involves the provision of housing and the Council cannot currently demonstrate a 5-year housing land supply and, as such, the \"tilted balance\" as set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF 2024 is engaged and permission should be granted for the development unless:\ri)\tThe application of policies in the NPPF that protect areas of assets of particular importance provide a clear reason for refusing the development; or\rii)\tAny adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rThe principle of providing 1 additional residential unit on a small-site in an established residential area is considered to be acceptable in principle, subject to consideration of all other material planning considerations.\r\rStandard of accommodation \rThe proposal would provide 1 x 2 bed 3 person unit. The proposed unit would have an internal floorspace of 81 sqm with a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75% of the habitable floorspace which would comply with the internal space standards of the London Plan Policy D6. \r\rThe unit would be of a practical layout and would be provided with refuse and recycling facilities and cycle parking which would be secured by condition. \r\rThe proposal does not provide any private or communal amenity space. The other units within the building have limited or no private or communal amenity space and the provision of amenity space either communal or private in nature is not a characteristic of the host building or the immediate adjacent residential properties in this part of Coombe Road. The applicant has also pointed to a number of parks and open spaces within easy walking or cycle distance to the proposed development site and in line the Council's SPD Residential Design policy guidance a reduced level or no amenity space in relation to that recommended is considered acceptable where the provision of amenity space is not a prevalent characteristic of the immediate locale. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraph 216 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on non heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not cause harm to the non designated heritage asset the Local Area of Special Character that the proposal site is located in.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rThe proposed development of a 1 x 2 bed unit would under Policy T6.1 of the London Plan in this site location be required to have up to 0.75 space (max standard). The proposal does not provide off street parking. \r\rThe site is located in an area of controlled parking and directly opposite Norbiton station and in close proximity to a number of bus routes in and out of Kingston.\r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not result in excess demand for on-street parking and that the proposal would not create residual cumulative impacts on the road network that would be severe. \r\rCycle parking \rPolicy T5 of the Plan table 10.2 would require a minimum of 2 spaces for the proposed development (1 x 2 bed 3 person unit). The applicant has shown cycle parking cycle parking details on the plan however it is not clear how many of these are allocated for the proposed unit. As such a condition is recommended to secure the appropriate level of cycle parking for the proposed unit.\r\rFire safety\rPolicy D12 of the London Plan would require all developments to give regard to fire safety and ensure that they are fire safe. A condition is recommended to secure the submission of a fire safety statement to be agreed for the operation/maintenance of the development.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r"
