    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \rNo response received\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 207 to 221 of the NPPF (2024) sets out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe site is located in the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area or the non designated heritage asset the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters \rThe application is supported by a fire safety strategy. It is considered that this demonstrates compliance with policy D12 of the London Plan and a condition is recommended to secure that the development is carried out in accordance with the deposited strategy.  \r\rThe site is the subject of a number of tree preservation orders. The application relates to a roof extension to the property and involves no groundworks. The application will have no impact on trees.\r\rThe site is in an area of archaeological significance. The application relates to a roof extension to the property and involves no groundworks. The application will have no impact on archaeology.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey infill to side / rear extension. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\r\rPlanning History \r24/02533/PAEXT - Erection of single storey  rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height of 3.0m) Prior Approval Not Required 20.11.24\r24/02043/PAEXT -  Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height 3m) Prior Approval Refused on 13.09.24\r24/01259/HOU  -Demolition of an existing rear extension,erection of a single storey side and rear extension, installation of 3 nos rooflights to ground floor single storey rear extension and 2nos UPVC casement windows into the side elevation of new ground floor rear extension. Refused 31.07.24\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal  seeks approval for the erection of a single storey infill to side/ rear extension.  \r\rOfficers note the applicant has revisited the proposal following the refusal of an earlier application ( ref :24/01269/HOU).\r\rThe proposal seeks to retain the existing single storey rear extension which has a single aspect roof. \r\rThe proposed single storey side and rear infill would extend a maximum depth of 5.395m  from the existing rear elevation wall of the dwelling and a width of 2.265m.  Neighbouring no 259  Malden Road has a single storey 3m depth rear extension with a single aspect roof (planning ref : 97/05025/FUL). It would infill the existing external space between no 2 Amberwood Rise and neighbouring 259 Malden Road, extending 2.4m beyond the existing rear building line of the neighbouring  single storey rear extension.  The proposed infill extension would have a single aspect roof with an eaves height of 3m and a maximum pitch height of  3.8m accommodating 3nos rooflights . Whilst the proposed  depth of the overall infill rear/ side extension exceeds the Policy Guidance 33  recommendation in the Residential Design SPD , Officers note the  design revisions  with the reduction of the overall depth of the built form along the shared  boundary with neighbouring 259 Malden Road and would be considered to be acceptable.  \r\rHowever,  Officers have noted there is an inconsistency in the submitted drawings  in respect of the retention of the existing single storey rear extension  which is illustrated on the existing and proposed ground floor plans. The existing rear elevation drawing ( Drawing no 106 Rev B)  shows the existing  single storey rear extension  with a  single aspect roof which is reaffirmed on the existing side elevation drawing  ( Drawing No 107 Rev B). The  proposed rear elevation drawing ( Drawing No 306 Rev B )  does not show the presence/ retention of the existing single aspect roof yet the  proposed side elevation ( Drawing No 307 Rev B) shows the retention of the single aspect roof.  The existing and proposed roof plans ( Drawing No 104 Rev B & Drawing no  304 Rev B) appear to show a single aspect roof. Therefore, Officers are unable to review and assess the relationship between existing and proposed roof arrangements of the  single storey extensions \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rDue to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the character appearance of the host dwelling or the immediate surrounding area. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact  in terms of character and appearance, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (20210 and Policies CS8  and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012)\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at no 259 Malden Road. \r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary  to the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

The proposed two storey rear extension would  be positioned in the same built footprint  projecting a  depth of 2.562m and width of 1.512m.   It would have an overall height of 5.652m  which would be  aligned with the existing eaves yet would present a flat roof arrangement retaining the existing chimney and parapet wall/ ridge between the neighbouring dwellings.  The inclusion of a proposed flat roof  would be contrary to Policy Guidance 34 in the Residential Design Guide.  The proposed rear elevation would present bifolding doors and a single  timber sash window  and a new timber sash window would be introduced on the existing side elevation of the dwelling. \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rThe proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.
