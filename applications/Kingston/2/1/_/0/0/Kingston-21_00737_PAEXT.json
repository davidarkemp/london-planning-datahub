    "The proposed extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within an estate of similarly designed properties. The site falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset)\r\rProposal\rPart conversion of internal garage into habitable room, demolition of existing first floor rear conservatory, erection of first floor rear extension. Fenestration alteration.\r\rConsultation\r18 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 195 to 214 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 209 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The application proposes a change of materials that are used on the front elevation and would therefore be highly visible due to the prominent position of the property as you enter into the estate. The application seeks to replace the current horizontal white wooden cladding to a vertical grey aluminium cladding. The proposed materials would detract from the coherent appearance/group value of the properties which share similar materials and design along Morecoombe Close. The proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to the proposed first floor rear extension, due to the orientation and the existing situation on site no harm has been identified. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The submitted location plan does not show the land required for access to the site from a public road/ highway. Please revise the red outline in the location plan to show the access from the public road."
