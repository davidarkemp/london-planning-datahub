    "The proposed extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application follows the refusal of application ref: 23/03467/CLC dated 13.02.2024 for the following reason:\r\r'The details submitted pursuant to Conditions: 3 (Cycle Parking), 4 (Refuse Stores) and 5 (Fire Safety Strategy) are insufficient to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of the conditions, the reasons for the conditions and the relevant planning policies'\r\rAssessment\r\rCondition 3 of planning permission ref: 23/02553/FUL is as follows:\r\r'Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby approved, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rThe cycle parking facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained for that purpose and kept free from obstruction thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up,in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.'\r\rOfficer Assessment: As with the refused application ref: 23/03467/CLC, due to the positioning of the cycle store behind the 2x car parking spaces  there would only be a gap of approximately 0.85m between the house and the closest car for users to wheel their bikes to and from the cycle store. This would be reduced to approximately 0.5m where the new electric vehicle charging point would be installed.\r\rFigure 8.1 of the London Cycling Design Standards (2014) is clear that access aisle widths to cycle parking must be a minimum width of 1.8m (ideally 3m in width). As such, the proposed cycle parking would not be easily accessible to users and would therefore fail to promote sustainable modes of travel. \r\rFurthermore, it is considered that a cycle store of a maximum height of 2.124m, depth of 2.2m and width of 1.95m in this position close to the footway would be overly prominent and incongruous within the street scene. While hedging could partially screen the store, were any hedging to be removed the store would be highly visible in the street scene. In addressing the issues with the accessibility of the cycle store the applicant is encouraged to explore alternative positions within the site which would be less prominent within the streetscene.\r\rThe issues identified with previously refused application ref: 23/03467/CLC in relation to Condition 3 have not been addressed.\r\rCondition 4 of planning permission ref: 23/02553/FUL is as follows:\r\r'Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby approved, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to the beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.'\r\rOfficer Assessment: The Recycling & Waste Technical Planning Guidance (April 2021) sets out requirements for refuse and recycling facilities. It is stated that 140l bins have a depth of 560mm, a width of 480mm and a height of 1065mm. \r\rIn response to the previous refusal ref: 23/03467/CLC the applicant has amended the siting of the waste and recycling store so that it would comply with the guidance and would be fully usable by residents. This is welcomed. The details submitted pursuant to Condition 4 are therefore considered to be acceptable.\r\rCondition 5 of planning permission ref: 23/02552/FUL is as follows:\r\r'Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rThe Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.'\r\rOfficer Assessment: Following the refusal of application ref: 23/03467/CLC the applicant has submitted the same document titled  'Fire Risk Assessment for UKFP Limited' dated 18.12.2023. It is noted that the submitted Assessment does not reference Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rAs was noted with the previous refusal, the submitted Assessment contains some fire safety information which is relevant to Condition 5 such as 'Recommended Actions' which include some passive and active fire safety measures. However, it is noted that there is no commitment within the submission for the recommended measures to be implemented. As such, any recommendations would not be enforceable were the document to be approved. The submission is also lacking in detail of suitable means of escape/an evacuation strategy (for example the submission states that: 'At the time of the assessment a fire strategy wasn't available'). This is clearly contrary to the requirements of Policy D12(A).\r\rOverall, it has not been demonstrated how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety. The submission does not robustly address the requirements of Condition 5 and does not appear to have been produced with reference to the London Plan Guidance - Fire Safety or Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rThe issues raised in the refusal of application ref: 23/03467/CLC have not been addressed by the applicant.\r\rCondition 7 of planning permission ref: 23/02553/FUL is as follows:\r\rWithin 3 months of the date of this decision, the Good Neighbour Policy Document shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The development shall thereafter be carried out and maintained in accordance with the approved Good Neighbour Policy for the duration of the development, unless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rOfficer Assessment: The submitted Good Neighbour Policy is considered to be satisfactory. \r\rA number of conditions have been submitted under a single cover. As such, whilst elements of the submission are acceptable, the application as a whole 24/00793/CLC is refused.\r",
    "PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:\r\rOn the 1st May 2024 the Council adopted a new Validation Local List. \r\rPlease ensure that your application submission includes all the necessary documentation as required by the new Local List and complete and submit a \"Validation Checklist - Section 3\" to confirm that you have provided all mandatory documents.\r\rThe new Validation Local List and Checklist can be found on the council's website: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\r\rThe LPA will not conduct any validation checks until the correct Checklist has been submitted. Upon receipt of a completed Checklist, the application will be assigned to a validation officer to review. Please do not simply state N/A in the checklist without a written justification.\r\rIf you need to make any changes to your application please try to do this via the Planning Portal website where possible. If that is not possible please send amended documents via the email address quoted in this letter.\r"
