    "Due to the scale, form and bulk of the proposed single storey rear extension, the proposed development would result in an incongruous addition to the host property, and would not relate well to the prevailing form of development in the immediate surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "\rIntroduction: \r\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors. \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents. By indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe Development Plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames consists of the following documents:\r\rThe London Plan 2021\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022 \rThe LDF Core Strategy 2012\rThe Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rOfficer Report:\r\rApplication Site: \r \rThe application site is a large two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Henley Drive. The site is situated within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe site is not located within a conservation area nor is it, or located nearby to, a statutory listed building and non-designated heritage asset. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is for the demolition of existing house and erection of new house\r\rRelevant History: \r\r1509/MC/10: Use of land for housing purposes. Refuse on 22 Jan 1953\r1815/MC/10: Use of land for erection of 40 dwelling houses. Application Granted on 09 Sep 1954\r1852/MC/17: Use of land for erection of 30 dwelling houses. Application Granted on 09 Dec 1954\r2243/MC: Bungalow and garage. Application Granted on 26 Apr 1956\r2483/MC: Detached bungalow. Refuse on 26 Jun 1957\r2505/MC: Bungalow and garage. Application Granted on 14 Aug 1957\r\rThere were a number of householder applications for extensions and external alterations following the histories above.\r\r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 4 adjoining landowners/occupants were consulted and no responses were received. \r\rConsultee Comments\r\rHighway - lacks cycle store, electric vehicle charging point should be provided for the proposed dwelling. A Construction Management Plan should be submitted.\rTree - no objection \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\rPrinciple of Development \rStandard of Accommodation\rCharacter and Design \rImpact on Residential Amenity\rHighways and Transportation\rBiodiversity and Landscaping\rTree\rSustainability and Climate Change\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rFire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development: \r\rThe London Plan 2021 (LP) Policy GG2 and Paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 (NPPF) promote the redevelopment of underutilised land for the delivery of housing. Policy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (CS) sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the LP. LP Policy H1 sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10-year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThe Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply of housing land as required by the NPPF therefore, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a strong reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In other words, the tilted balance weighs a development's adverse impacts against its benefits, not on a level playing field, but tilted towards granting permission. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application. \r\rThe proposal would demolish a 4-bedroom family home and replace it with a 6-bedroom family home. The principle of residential development on the site is supported as it would not result in the loss of a family-sized home, in compliance with CS Policy DM14. This carries weight in favour of the application. Support for the principle of development is subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation:\r\rLP Policy D6 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall GIA, built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. CS Policy DM13 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rThere are no specific standards under LP Policy D6 for a 4-storey 6-bedroom dwelling. However, the proposed GIA would far exceed the minimum 134 qm GIA requirement for a 3-storey 5-bedroom 8-person dwelling under LP Policy D6. The overall GIA, bedroom sizes and storage space are considered acceptable.\r\rThe dwelling would be dual aspect which is preferred in accordance with LP Policy D6 as single-aspect dwellings are more difficult to ventilate naturally and are more likely to overheat. Each habitable room would be serviced by at least one openable window or door for suitable ventilation, outlook and access to natural light, in compliance with LP Policy D6. No sunlight/daylight assessment has been submitted however, Officers confirm the habitable rooms would likely achieve the required standards under BRE Guidance. \r\rObscure glazing for all windows that service bathrooms and secondary windows will be secured by condition to protect the privacy of future occupants. \r\rAlthough there is no proposed section plan submitted, given the overall height of the building, this element appears to be acceptable. Further, given its overall floor area and dual aspect feature, future occupants would achieve an acceptable standard of daylight penetration, ventilation, cooling and sense of space.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would have sufficient space for a rear garden in compliance with CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD) (2013). \r\rThe new dwelling would meet at least Building Regulation M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings' in terms of step-free access which is in compliance with LP Policy D7. \r\rIn summary, the proposed dwelling would achieve an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants, in terms of daylight, ventilation and cooling, and sense of space in compliance with LP Policy D6, CS Policy DM10 and policy guidance under the Residential Design Guide SPD. This is given neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rCharacter and Design: \r\rNPPF 2024 states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rCS Policy CS8 and DM10 and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide SPD require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of the existing dwellinghouse and construction of a dwellinghouse. The new building will be moved forward than the existing one and it would be in line with the building lines of the adjoining properties. The footprint will be reduced and it will go upward with three storey and a basement level. Officers consider the proposed development footprint and plot coverage would generally be acceptable given that it would not exceed more than 50% of the site area. The proposed development height would be supportable given it generally matches the height of development in the direct vicinity. \r\r\rIn terms of architectural style and detailed design, there will be a large three storey high glass window with an arch feature at front elevation. The proposed proportion of the windows is considered poor and it does not keep the character of the neighboring properties. The space between the two adjoining priorities are very tight. The architectural style, the design and amount of the windows proposed would exacerbate the scramped situation. The proposal has not demonstrated that the design and details would be harmonious to the street scene and the character of the neighbouring properties.\r\rOverall the proposal by way of its architectural style, proportion and design details would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the street scene and the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. This would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8, and DM 10  of the Core Strategy (2012). This carries weight against the proposal. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\r\rNPPF 2024 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. \r\rCS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rThe principal properties that have been considered are the dwellinghouses directly to the north and south of the property at no. 30 and 28 Henley Drive. No significant impacts will be created on the amenity of the neighbours to its west and east given the separate distance.\r\rThe new dwelling is setback from the boundary between no.30 and it is setback at second floor level from the boundary between no.28. There are no side windows at nos. 28 and 30 facing the proposal which serve habitable rooms. The submitted 45-Degree Plan demonstrates the proposal would comply with the 45-degree test from the nearest rear windows on no. 28 and 30 and would not result in unacceptable impacts on neighbouring occupants, in terms of overbearing enclosure or loss of daylight, in compliance with LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 17 in Council's Residential Design Guide SPD. \r\rThere will be two side bedroom windows on the second floor. These windows facing towards nos. 28 and 30 will have limited view to the neighbouring rear gardens and there are no habitable windows at their side elevations. Therefore there will be no significant impact on overlooking from these two windows. The other side facing windows will be obscure glazed given they service bathrooms or are secondary windows to bedrooms. Obscure glazing can be secured by condition. \r\rThe proposed development is for a replacement dwellinghouse which would be in keeping with the residential character of the area. The comings and goings to the property would increase with the increase in bedrooms however,  Officers do not consider the noise and disturbance levels would extend beyond reasonable expectations for a sustainable suburban location. \r\rThe applicant submitted Basement Impact Assessment (December 2024) which concludes that the proposed basement construction will not affect the foundation stress areas of the adjacent properties, specifically 28 Henley Drive and 30 Henley Drive. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not cause undue harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, and noise and disturbance, subject to final details being secured by condition. Compliance with LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10 has been demonstrated. This is given neutral weight in the assessment of the scheme.\r\rHighways and Transportation:\r\rNPPF 2024 states development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network, following mitigation, would be severe. CS Policy DM10 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe site has a PTAL rating of 0, which indicates a very poor access to the public transport network. However, bus stops for bus route 265 are located within a 5-minute walk (northbound service), along Robin Hood Way, and 8 minutes walk on the A3, for the  southbound service, respectively. The closest rail station is New Malden, located approx. 2.4km away, which is operated by South Western trains.\r\rThe proposed ground floor plan indicates the provision of at least 2 car parking spaces. Although this is more than the 1.5 spaces per dwelling of 3 bedrooms and more, set by Policy T6.1 of the London Plan, it appears the 2 car spaces will occupy the same forecourt car parking area in the existing situation. Therefore, the car parking spaces are considered acceptable. There are no proposed changes to the vehicle access layout. In line with Policy T6.1(c) of the London Plan, an electric vehicle charging point should be provided for the proposed dwelling. A Construction Management Plan should be submitted which can be conditioned.\r\rThe proposed development does not include cycle parking details. In line with Policy T5 of the London Plan, a secure and covered cycle storage for a minimum of 2 cycles should be provided. \r\rBiodiversity and Landscaping: \r\rParagraph 187 of the NPPF states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by minimising impacts on and providing net gains for biodiversity. \r\r\rLP Policy G6 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain (BNG). A mandatory BNG of 10% is required under Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021). This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process.  \r\rCS Policy DM10 sets out that development proposals should ensure that landscaping is an integral part of the overall design of all new developments and that landscaping proposals are submitted as part of planning applications.\r\rThe submitted Biodiversity Checklist confirms the site is not, nor is it located nearby to, a designated site or priority habitat and would not impact protected or priority species. However, the proposal involves demolition of a pre-1960 property and the site is within 50m from Coombe Hill Wood and it is near a river meaning the development has the potential to impact on bats, breeding birds and other protected species. No Preliminary Ecological Appraisal has been completed by a qualified ecologist. Insufficient evidence has been provided to evidence if there are protected or priority species on the site and if mitigation measures are required to manage potential impacts on ecological features, contrary to LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. Further, there is justification or provision of  BNG of 10% on site, which is contrary to NPPF and LP Policy G6. This carries weight against the proposal. \r\rTree\rThe development will not have an adverse impact on trees. Council Tree Officer was consulted and no objection was raised.\r\r\rClimate Change and Sustainability:\r\rNPPF at para 161 sets an expectation that planning will support transition to net zero by 2050. \r\r\rLP Policy SI 2 requires major development to be net zero-carbon. Although the subject application is not a major application, greenhouse gas emissions should be minimised to the greatest extent possible. \r\r\rCS Policy DM3 states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling. \r\r\rA condition could be secured to ensure the proposed dwelling would achieve a mains water consumption of 105L or less per person per day, in line with the Optional Requirement of the Building Regulations and specified in LP Policy SI 5. This is a neutral matter in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rFlood Risk and Drainage:\r\r\rThe NPPF at para 181 states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood-risk assessment. LP Policy SI 12 confirms development proposals should ensure that flood risk is minimised and mitigated, and that residual risk is addressed. \r\rThe NPPF at para 182 confirms that applications which could affect drainage on or around the site should incorporate sustainable drainage systems to control flow rates and reduce volumes of runoff. LP Policy S1 13 states that development proposals should aim to achieve greenfield run-off rates and ensure that surface water run-off is managed as close to its source as possible. \r\r\rCS Policy DM4 requires development proposals to give full consideration to the Borough Strategic Flood Risk Assessment 2024 (SFRA) and related studies including the surface water management plans, to include sustainable urban drainage systems (SUDS) to manage and reduce surface water run-off, demonstrate that there is adequate public sewerage capacity to serve their development and deal with surface water run-off. \r\r\rThe proposed site is located in Flood Zone 1, which indicates a low probability of flooding, specifically less than a 0.1% annual chance of river or sea flooding. This classification suggests that the area is generally considered safe from significant flood risks. Since the development is less than 1 hectare and there are no critical drainage issues identified at the proposed site, this element is considered acceptable. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rA Fire Statement has been submitted. Officers think that the document lacks details and sufficient information, which would be contrary to LP Policy D12. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. A Fire Statement could be secured by condition. \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. \r\r\rThe proposal would not result in a loss of a family-sized dwellinghouse in compliance with CS Policy DM14 and would continue to make a small but positive contribution towards the borough's housing supply which would carry positive weight in favour of the application. \r\r\rThe dwellinghouse by way of its architectural style, proportion and design details would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the street scene and the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. This would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8, and DM 10  of the Core Strategy (2012). This carries significant weight against the proposal. \r\r\rInsufficient information, in the form of a Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, has been provided to assess whether the proposed development would not result in unacceptable impacts on ecology and biodiversity on the site, and the proposed development would fail to provide BNG, contrary to para 193 of the NPPF, LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. This carries significant weight. \r\rThe proposed development would be deficient in cycle parking and would not comply with policy T5 of the London Plan and Policy DM 8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. This carries neutral weight. \r\rInsufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal will ensure the safety of future occupants, contrary to Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021. This carries neutral weight. \r\rOfficers have taken into account the Housing Delivery Test tilted presumption in favour of development as set out in para 11 of the NPPF whilst considering the conflicts with the Development Scheme. For this scheme, the adverse impacts of the development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole. As such, Officers recommend planning permission be refused. \r\r\rBackground Papers:\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---End of Officer Report—\r\r\r"
