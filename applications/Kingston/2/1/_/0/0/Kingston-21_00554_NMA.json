    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Grove Crescent Conservation Area and the Kingston Town Centre, Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 24/00069/HOU - Demolition of an existing outbuilding shed, partial conversion of an existing garage into sunroom. Erection of first floor side extension. Loft conversion with side and rear dormer and installation of 1no front roof light. Refused on 04.03.2024 for the following reasons:\r\r- The proposed development would be incongruous and would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Grove Cresent Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted a planning application (ref:24/00069/HOU) which was refused. The applicant has now submitted amends to address the concerns initially raised. The proposed development would still involve the erection of a side and rear dormer, a first-floor side extension and the partial conversion of the existing garage. \r\rThe proposed partial conversion of the garage located towards the southern elevation would involve the removal of the existing garage door and the installation of a new garage door which would no longer include glazing. The alterations to the garage also no longer include an increase in roof height of approximately 4.1m but rather it would maintain the existing height of 2.8m.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge that the proposed first-floor extension would be visible from the streetscene, the extension would have a sufficient setback from the front elevation by approximately 2.3m and a set down from the roof ridge by approximately 2.8m. This would aid in obscuring its visibility in the streetscene. Additionally, the first-floor extension would now have a pitched roof form which would resemble the existing dwelling and respect Policy Guidance 36, of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rWhilst the proposed dormer window would maintain more than 500mm from the side, eaves and ridge, it would appear incongruous in the streetscene, as the development of this style can not be found on Grove Cresent. Additionally, the side dormer in conjunction with the first-floor side extension would be an obvious and bulky addition to the host dwelling, therefore, throwing the pair of Victorian cottages off balance.\r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 206 of the NPPF 2023 states that any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A planned estate of roads laid out in the 1850s by the National Freehold Land Society, an early building society dedicated to voting reform, with plots developed in an individual and piecemeal fashion throughout the 19th & 20th centuries.\r\rKingston Town CAAC was consulted on the proposed development and made an objection statement: The proposed side roof dormer & double-storey extension with its double pitch roof would be incongruous additions to this property, intrude on the street scene, spoil the symmetry of this attractive pair of early Victorian cottages & cause harm to the character & appearance of the CA. In addition, the volume of new glazing proposed to the rear elevation of the property appears excessive even if it would not be visible from the public realm.\r\rIn accordance with Paragraph 208 of the NPPF (2023), any less than substantial harm must be weighed against the public benefits of the scheme. In this case, the development is a householder extension. It is not considered that any wider public benefits would arise from the proposals which would outweigh the less than substantial harm.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Grove Cresent Conservation Area and would cause less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies the same footprint as the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the partial conversion of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. \r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which does not sufficiently set out which policy criteria is not relevant to the development and why. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed front extension would be visible would be visible from the street, however, development of this style is not unusual in Selbourne Avenue and the extension would appear small in scale from the streetscene and proportionate to the host dwelling. \r\rThe applicant proposed to link the existing garage to a single-storey rear extension which would have a depth of approximately 4m and a part flat, part pitched roof height of approximately 3.3m with an eave height of 2.6m. The applicant also proposes to alter the existing garage roof to match the style and height of the proposed rear extension. Whilst officers acknowledge that the depth of the proposed rear extension would not comply with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD, it would not be visible in the streets and would appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling. \r\rOverall, the proposed development would not adversely impact the character or appearance of the area and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the 45 degree BRE guidance, and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would extend past the rear elevation of No. 44 Selbourne Avenue by approximately 4m and would only maintain approximately 100mm from the boundary. Whilst officers acknowledged that this causes the proposal to fail the 45-degree test on plan, the applicant has sufficiently demonstrated that it would not fail on elevation. Therefore, the proposed development would not cause a significant loss of daylight to the nearest ground-floor window at No.44 Selbounrne Avenue.\r\rThe closest ground-floor window at No.44 Selbourne Avenue, serves a bathroom which is not considered a habitable room. As such, although officers acknowledge some loss of daylight to that window, there would not be a significant loss of light to the habitable rooms of neighbouring property No.44 as a result of the proposed development.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
