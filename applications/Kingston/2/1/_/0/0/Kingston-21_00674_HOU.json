    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level in the south elevation of the dwelling house currently known as \"Summercourt, Kingston Hill, Kingston Upon Thames, KT2 7JH\" as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 24.02.2021, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Validation Checklist Update - Please ensure you have provided all documents required to support your application in line with the Validation Local List and update the Checklist document with any changes you have made to your application.\rIt is also noted that although you have submitted site photographs the Checklist states that you have not. For accuracy please correct this part of the form.\r",
    "The site comprises a ground-floor maisonette within the Lime Grove, Local Area of Special Character.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a depth of approximately 2.7m and a pitch roof height of approximately 2.8m, falling in line with  Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, the proposed rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene and would appear subordinate to the host dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge that the proposed lean-to-side extension would be visible in the streetscene, the applicant has ensured that a sufficient distance of approximately 2.4m has been maintained from the front elevation and that the proposed roof of the side extension would respect the pitched roof of the existing roof. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing, and design. It is considered that the proposed development would have no adverse impacts on the area's character or appearance.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed developments, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD, and find that the extensions would pass on both plan and elevation, therefore there would not be a significant loss of light to neighbouring properties No.43 and No.47 Lime Grove, as a result of the proposed development. \r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is also considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 216 of the NPPF 2024 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would be in general keeping with the Residential Design SPD and it would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, but rather preserve it. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Lime Grove, Local Area of Special Character. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
