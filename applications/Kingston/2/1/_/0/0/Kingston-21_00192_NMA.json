    "In respect of condition 2 of application reference 19/00582/FUL,\r\rThe following plans:\rKDNH-IBI-00-ZZ-M2-BA-000-0200 Rev 2 - Proposed Elevation 05/03/2019\rKDNH-IBI-00-ZZ-M2-BA-000-0201 Rev 1 - Street Scene 05/03/2019\r\rare replaced by:\rKDNH-IBI-00-ZZ-M2-BA-000-0200_19 - Proposed Elevation\rKDNH-IBI-00-ZZ-M2-BA-000-0201_5 Street Scene\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r23/01005/HOU - Demolition of lean-to extension and conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension with part first floor extension. Refused on 04/08/2023\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application under planning application ref: 23/01005/HOU which proposed an erection of single-storey rear extension with part first-floor extension. This was refused as the first floor extension appeared excessive in scale and would have appeare bulky. The amended proposal omits the first floor extension and retains the proposed single storey side/rear extension with changes to fenestration. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have an additional depth of approx. 4.1m from the existing lean-to extension and a total approximate depth of 9.5m, which would exceed the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 of 3.5m. However, the proposed ground floor extension would not be visible from the street and would not be incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.  It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The refused application ref: 23/01005/HOU second reason for refusal was that the depth and siting of the proposed extensions in relation to neighbouring property No.62 Worthington Road would adversely affect their amenities by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of daylight to their closest ground floor principal habitable room window (reception room).\r\rThe applicant has addressed the reason for refusal by omitting the first-floor extension and demonstrating that the proposed side/rear extension would not breach the 45 or 25-degree rule on elevation. \r\rGiven the proximity of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, and the removal of the first floor rear extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
