    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Flood Risk Zone 2 and 3.\r\rProposal \rReplacement of existing boundary wall with 2m high brick wall. Installation of 2 nos gates.\r\rConsultations\r20 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rRBK's Highway Engineer -  objects to the proposal\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Highway Safety; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the existing street scene, which is generally characterised by low front boundary walls.  Whilst  there is some variety of style and height of the front boundary treatment, the predominantly green and open character is noted. \r\rThe proposed front boundary wall and gates would be approximately 2m in height, which due to its design and excessive height, would appear as a solid and dominant feature in the street scene, adversely affecting the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The RBK's Highways Engineer provided the following comments:\r'The proposed new vehicle gate slides along the proposed raised wall to open while the pedestrian gate has been designed to open inwards. This is considered acceptable.\r\rHowever, the proposed wall height of 1.3m and 2.0m high gate columns are contrary to the allowable horizontal (6.6m, which is 3.3m on either side from midpoint of the crossover) & vertical (0.6m) pedestrian visibility splays, as stipulated in the RBK Vehicle Crossover Policy.\" Due to the lack of visibility spays the proposal would give rise to highway safety concerns.\r\rA such, it is considered that due to the height and design of the fence, the proposal would  fail to provide  adequate visibility splays to ensure  that there would be no adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Paragraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFlood Risk \rThe application site is located within the Flood Zone 2 and only partially (the corner of the front garden) within Flood Zone 3.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Flood Risk Statement demonstrating that the proposal due to its scale, siting and nature would not increase risk of flooding in relation to the host dwelling and the adjoining properties.  \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
