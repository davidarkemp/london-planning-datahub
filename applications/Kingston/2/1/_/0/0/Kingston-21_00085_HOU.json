    "By reason of its gable roof form, lack of set back from the front elevation and lack of set down from the main roof ridge and proximity to the shared boundary with No. 41 Mayfair Avenue the proposed two storey side extension would appear excessively bulky and dominant in scale and unbalance the symmetry with the roof form of adjoining property No. 37 Mayfair Avenue. As such the proposed development would not relate well to the host dwelling and would result in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
