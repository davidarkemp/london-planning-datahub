The development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the construction management plan, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period.\r\rReason: This information is required prior to the commencement of development in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic from the outset, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "No impact piling shall take place until and piling method statement (detailing the type of piling to be undertaken and the methodology by which such piling will be carried out, including measures to prevent and minimise the potential for damage to subsurface sewerage infrastructure, and the programme for the works) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method statement.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard drainage systems in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "A sample of the facing materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted, including details of the balustrading for the rooftop terrace, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any works above ground level are commenced on site. The development shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before any construction works above ground level on site are commenced, a scheme of noise insulation/reduction shall be submitted to ensure that the noise level of 35 dBLAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBLAeq, 8 hour and 45 dBLAmax during the night time (measured with F time-weighting and between 2300 and 0700 hours) in bedrooms in accordance with BS8233:2014 shall not be exceeded.\r\rWhere these levels cannot be met with windows open, appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised.\r\rReason: In order to protect future occupiers against traffic, commercial, and railway noise.\r",

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r3 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, erection of a single storey rear extension. Installation of 2nos rear rooflights to main roof. \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a terrace dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r24/00377/HOU - Conversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, erection of a single storey rear extension. Installation of 3 nos rear roof lights to main roof. Granted 09.04.24\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the conversion of an existing garage  into  a habitable space, erection of a single storey rear extension. Installation of 2nos rear rooflights to main roof. \r\rThe proposed conversion of the garage into a habitable space together with associated alterations and installation of  2nos additional rooflights to the existing rear roofslope are considered to be in keeping with the host dwelling and the existing street scene.\r\rThe proposed modest scale single storey rear extension would project a depth of 3.4m  and a width of 6.694m. It would have a parapet roof with a proposed height of 3.3m . The rear elevation would present  patio doors and  the flank wall would present a large single window. \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear extension and the conversion of the garage into a habitable space, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rWhile it is noted that the proposal would fail the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable  window at neighbouring no 52 Lower Green Gardens, however this is not the only habitable opening to the open plan kitchen area, as such it is considered that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property.\r\rGiven the separation distance and the siting of the proposal in relation to neighbouring no 48 Lower Green Gardens, it is considered that the proposal would pass the 45 degree rule and therefore it would not have a significant impact on levels of daylight received by this property.  \r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves the  conversion of the existing garage into a habitable space. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r\rNo neighbour response received.\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer raises no objection but recommends a landscape and planting scheme with tree replacement planting condition.\r\rKTCAAC - No objection \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. \rParagraphs 189 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on designated and non designated heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated or non non designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposed development does not follow the guiding principles of the Council's Residential Design SPD the proposed development in this instance in the context of the site and its surroundings is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and the proposal would preserve the character and appaearance of the designated Liverpool Road Conservation Area that the proposal sits within. In addition it is considered that the proposal would not cause harm to the setting of the Statutorily Listed building, its curtilage and boundary of the St Peters Church and Vicarage adjacent to the site.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light or overbearing appearance. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would have some impact on privacy to the neighbouring properties as proposed. An upper ground floor balcony is proposed which would afford views into the neighbouring properties gardens either side of the application site. It is recommended that a privacy screen the detail of which to be secured by condition is erected along the sides of the balcony to a height of 1.7 m above the finished floor level of the balcony to mitigate against adverse overlooking of the neighbouring properties. It is acknowledged that the current platform/landing at the top of the rear external staircase to the garden affords veiws currently into the nieghbouring porperties however it is considered that without the recommended privacy screening to the proposed balcony the current relationship in regards to privacy would be worsened. \r\rOther matters\r\rA condition is recommended to secure a fire safety strategy statement in order to ensure the development accords with policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rThe application is supported with an arboricultural report and two trees are proposed to be removed as part of the proposals. There are no TPO's within 31, and the proposals do not affect the TPO trees in neighbouring properties. The two trees to be removed T.1 & T.2 are insignificant and offer no public amenity. The Birch has been heavily reduced in the past and appears to be either in decline or dead from the photos provided and the Bay is just a large shrub against the corner of the house.\r \rA landscape and planting condition with replacement tree planting is recommended.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to change the approved planning permission ref: 20/02984/HOU; this involves the amendments to increase the width  (1.4m to 1.6m) and reduce length (from 3.6m to 2.8m)  of the proposed porch and addition of windows to each side of the porch door.  \r\rThe Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent.

The area is mixed in use.\r\rConsultation \r\rNo response received.\r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r\rCharacter and Appearance/Amenity\rPublic safety\r\r\rCharacter and Appearance/Amenity\r\rThe signage would be on the front of the building. \r\rThe building is one of a number of ground floor commercial units on Clarence Street which have contrasting styles of signage and methods of illumination. It is considered that the proposed internally illuminated fascia and projecting signage would be of a sympathetic addition to and proportionate to the existing shop frontage of the host property and would not detract from its character and appearance and the surrounding area.  The proposed illuminance levels of 350cd/sqm of the proposed signage is considered to be acceptable and would not result in any harmful light pollution.\r\rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would accord with policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \rDemolition of rear conservatory and single storey side extension and erection of single storey rear and side extension with internal alterations.\r\rConsultations\rLondon Borough of Richmond upon Thames - no objection\r\rRepresentations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets;\r- Highways; and,\r- Fire Safety. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development due to its modest scale, siting and the proposed design is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways Safety\r\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the partial conversion of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Wilmer Close.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the remaining part of the garage.\r\rOther Matters\rThe application site adjoins Richmond Park to the rear. \r\rIt is noted that the applicant has submitted a Preliminary Roost Assessment Report that concludes: 'The building was assessed as having no known potential roosting features and holds negligible potential for roosting bats when referencing current guidance from the Bat Conservation Trust. As such, no further survey work is recommended. In the unlikely event that a bat is discovered during the works, work must cease immediately and ROAVR be contacted for advice'. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Condition 4 states:\rThe development shall be completed in accordance with the following key design details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, before building operations commence. Details at a scale of 1:5 or 1:10 or similarly appropriate of:\r\r(11) Internal and external lighting strategy i.e. plan clearly identifying how many and what fixings and samples / photos of products and finishes to be used. Information to be submitted before installing lighting\r\rReason: In order that the special architectural and historic character of this listed building is safeguarded in accordance with Policy CS8 (Character, Heritage and Design) and Policy DM 12 (Development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rCondition 4 part 11 (Key Design Details - Internal and external lighting strategy) - Officers have reviewed the information submitted and are satisfied this can now be approved. \r\rOfficers note that Condition 4.11 relating to the external lighting strategy was approved under application Ref. 20/01516/CLC dated 05.04.2022",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 4.11 (Internal and External Lighting Strategy) of listed building consent 19/01212/LBC is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "The site comprises a flat on the top floor of No.6Â Manor Drive.\r\r27 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed balcony would be contained within the existing framework that supports the balcony/platform to the top floor flat (second floor). Whilst the proposal would be small in scale and would not be visible in the streestscene it would be visible to neighbours. The proposed development would be out of keeping with the host building and, as such out of keeping with the wider area.Â \r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Policy Guidance 36, of the Residential Design SPD makes clear that the use of a flat roof for a roof terrace or balcony at two-storey heightÂ will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed balcony is not a common feature of this relatively low density suburban area. While the proposed privacy screens would help mitigate loss of privacy to neighbours it would not wholly mitigate this impact. The proposed balcony would be visually intrusive, result in a loss of privacy, cause overlooking and would give rise to additional noise and disturbance. It is considered that the proposed balcony would have a wholly unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\rConsultations\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been receivedÂ in relation to harm to residential amenity and character and appearanceÂ as a resultÂ of the proposed development. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRBK Highways Team- Objection\r\rRelevant Planning HistoryÂ \r21/03811/FUL -Â Erection of a new 2 bedroom 3 person dwelling including new vehicle crossover. Refused on 22.02.2022. Appeal dismissed onÂ 28.12.2022. Reasons for refusal:\r\r1) The proposal would erode the spaciousness of this plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In this regard, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.\r\r2)Â The proposed development by reason of it scale and siting would adversely impact the amenities of No. 54 Fullers Avenue through visual dominance, loss of outlook and sense of overbearing when viewed from the rear garden area and would adversely impact the amenities of No. 58 Fullers Avenue through visual dominance, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and overlooking, contrary to the policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r3)Â The applicant has failed to demonsrate through the submission of cogent information that the removal / displacement of the existing property's off-street parking provision would not lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network, lead to inconsiderate parking and have an unacceptable impact on highway safety in the immediate surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The applicant previously submitted an application for a new dwelling adjoining 18 Agar Close under planning application ref: 21/03811/FUL, which was refused for a number of reasons, one of which was the effects on character and appearance. While it is acknowledgedÂ that through this application the applicant is no longer seeking permission to construct a new dwelling, the proposed development under this application would resemble the previously refused in regards to the scale of the development.Â \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the two-storey side extension compared to the previously proposed development would be set down by approximately 300mm from the ridge of the original roof line, the width would be reduced from approximately 6m to 4.5m and the proposed roof form would resemble the pitched roof of the other end of the row of terracedÂ properties. However, the proposed two-storey side extension would have a width greater than 50% of the width of the existing dwelling falling out of line with Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 36 (Two Storey Side Extension). As such, the proposed development would still infill part of a generous gap between the existing property and the boundary with the adjacent dwelling to the south at No. 54 Fullers Avenue. The introduction of built form would erode the spaciousness that the site provides and would result in an incongruous addition to the area. \r\rAlthoughÂ the single-storey rear extension would be acceptable in principle, omitting the two-storey side extension would in turn make the single-storey extension impractical and, therefore unacceptable.Â \r\rThe proposed porch would appear small in scale and subordinate to the host dwelling. Addtionally, development of this type is not uncommon in the vicinity of Agar Close therefore, not cause a significant change in character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area.\r\rOverall, the proposed erection of two storey side extension is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Given the siting and distance of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring property No.16 Agar Close, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property No.16 by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\rThe proposed dwellinghouse would not feature any windows to its southern side elevation, either at ground or first floors. As such, there would be no increased loss of privacy or opportunity for overlooking the rear of No. 54 Fullers Avenue. \r\rThe rear elevation of the proposed two storey extension would leave a gap of approximately 6m to the rear boundary fence and approximately 11m at its nearest point to the built form of No. 58 Fullers Avenue adjoining the site to the east. This still would not be in accordance with Council's policy guidance set out in Policy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD relating to separation distances between habitable rooms or boundary fences and it is considered that there are not any existing site-specific characteristics, including land topography or landscape screening, to justify the relaxation of the Council's guidance. \r\rIt is considered that the scale and positioning of the proposed dwellinghouse would result in a materially harmful sense of visual enclosure and loss of privacy to No's 54 and 58 Fullers Avenue. \r\rOfficers consider that the dwelling's overall scale, massing, height and positioning would give rise to materially harmful impacts in terms of a sense of enclosure, overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers and the application proposal is considered not to be in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.Â \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The council highways team was consulted on the proposed development and objected to the submitted details for the following reasons:\r\rThe application is for the rear extension of ground and first floors to the existing building and provision of a new dropped kerb (crossover).\r\rThe site plan drawing shows an existing vehicle crossover for the site and the proposed location of a new crossover; however, it is not clear what will happen to the existing crossover. Any redundant crossover must be reinstated at the applicants cost and as such should be required by condition. This work would usually be undertaken by RBK Highways and will require a Crossover Application to be submitted, as is also required for any new vehicle crossover to be installed.\r\rThe applicant is proposing to construct a new vehicle crossover to serve a new off street parking space at the site. However, a detailed drawing of the proposed vehicle crossover has not been provided for consideration. The proposed crossover should be in line with the RBK Vehicle Crossover Policy Jan 2024.Â \r\rThe final approval for the crossover implementation will be determined through the submission of a separate crossover application to the Highway Authority, which will be reviewed by the local Crossover Officer.\r\rBased on the above reasons, Highway will not be able to support the application, pending the submission of a detailed drawing for the new vehicle crossover and an indication of the future status of the existing crossover at the site\r\rThe Council's Vehicle Crossover Policy, April 2020 states that an opening size, minimum of 2.7m and maximum of 4.0m must be provided at the back of the footway, measured at right angles to the public highway. The proposed vehicle crossover would be widened to approximately 2.5m falling outside the Vehicle Crossover Policy. It is understood that the 2.5m minimum width is in place to protect pedestrian and highway safety.\r\rTherefore, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety, the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey front porch and rear conservatory  extensions.  \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling.  \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the erection of a single storey front porch and rear conservatory extensions . \r\rThe existing  single storey front porch projects a depth of 0.627m,  width of 2.066m and roof height 2.6m. The proposed single storey porch would   project a  depth of 1m, width of 3.23m and maximum roof height 2.75m . It is understood the purpose of the proposed porch is to provide  access for a separate  disabled adult living space.  \r\rAt the rear of the dwelling, there is an existing decked area. The proposed rear conservatory extension would  reside within the decked area presenting a depth of 2.3m and width 7.48m. It would have a shallow single aspect pitch roof which would have an eaves height of 2.45m and maximum height 2.55m .   \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey  front porch extension  and rear conservatory extension,, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r"
