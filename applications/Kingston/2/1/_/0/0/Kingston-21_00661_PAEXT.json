  "description": "Erection of single storey rear extension (5.00m in depth, maximum height of 3.60m and eaves height of 2.83m) following demolition of existing conservatory",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a single storey commercial property with a two storey residential dwelling to the rear within the Oakhill Conservation Area (A). The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A Regency and early Victorian linear housing development made up of two separate areas Oakhill Conservation Area (A) which runs along the old turnpike road of Ewell Road and Oakhill Conservation Area (B) which is made up of five large properties in Langley Road. The area around Ewell Road was later converted to a commercial centre, together with an area of substantial Victorian houses and The Wood open space to the west.\r\rConsultation\r11 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rSurbiton CAAC - No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r-Character and Appearance/Amenity\r-Public safety\r\r\rCharacter and Appearance/Amenity\rThe signage would be on the front of the building and would be externally illuminated which is considered best practice in a conservation area.. \r\rIt is therefore considered that the proposed illuminated fascia would be a sympathetic addition to the  shop frontage of the host property and would not detract from its character and appearance and the surrounding Conservation Area.\r\rPublic safety\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would accord with policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy."
