    "All applications that involve extensions must provide \"45 Degree\" floor and elevation plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the 45 degree 'rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r",
    "The site comprises a maisonette, this application pertains to Flat 52B and 52C which are located on the loft floor.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to access or traffic problems, car park issues, noise and privacy.\r\rAll other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r- Other Matters (Standard of Accommodation & Car Parking )\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal involves the installation of 6no. roof lights; 4no. to the front of the roof slope, 1no. to the side and 1 to the rear. Addtionally, the applicant proposed 2no. velux cabrio velux balcony to the rear roof slope. Whilst officers acknowledge that the 4 roof lights to the front elevation would be visible in the streetscene, they would be subservient to the host building and are not uncommon in the vicinity of Hook Rise North. \r\rThe 2no. velux cabrio to the rear of the property, would also be visible in the streetscene but would be highly incongruous in the immediate vicinity, as balconies are not generally permitted in suburban low-density areas such as Hook Rise North.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of form and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the proposed cabrio balconies would not have an external walking area, like standard balconies, its protrusion allows for a clear view of the area. Policy Guidance 36, of the Residential Design SPD makes clear that the use balcony at a two-storey height will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rTherefore, the proposed Velux cabrio balconies would be visually intrusive, result in a loss of privacy, cause overlooking and may give rise to additional noise and disturbance.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which suitably addresses the relevant provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOther Matters \rStandard of Accommodation\rThe proposed development shows the installation of 4 rooflights and 2 balconies to the rear to accommodate the conversion of the loft into habitable space. The applicant has not demonstrated that the conversation would be linked to the existing flats on site, so it is noted that the two loft spaces will be used at the new flats, even though the applicant has not mentioned the change of use of these two spaces. \r\rIf Officers were minded to grant planning permission for the proposed roof lights in isolation, it would be subject to a planning condition restricting the use of the loft accommodation as ancillary/incidental to Nos. 52B and 52C respectively. Any use of the loft spaces for separate residential accommodation would require planning permission.\r\rCar Parking\rThe concerns raised about increased car parking demand are noted, however, the application seeks only to install roof lights. Were Officers minded to grant planning permission it would only be for the installation of roof lights and a planning condition would be added to restrict the use of the loft accommodation as ancillary/incidental to Nos. 52B and 52C respectively. Any use of the loft spaces for separate residential accommodation would require planning permission.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
