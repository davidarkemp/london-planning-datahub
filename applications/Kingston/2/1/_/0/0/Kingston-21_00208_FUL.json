    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and detailed design, would respond poorly to surrounding development, appearing as a cramped and discordant feature within the Manor Way street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would unduly deprive the occupants of Nos. 35 and 37 Church Road of privacy, resulting in unacceptable living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 3m from the rear wall and a total parapet roof height of approximately 3.1m, in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, development of this style would not be incongruous in the vicinity of Orme Road as several dwellings benefit from a similar rear extension.\r\rOfficers note that the construction of the proposed side extensions would in turn omit the side access to the rear garden, however, the extension would be the same modest height as the rear extension and would maintain 500mm as required by Policy Guidance 35, of the Residential Design SPD. Whislt officers note that the side extension would be visible in the streetscene, it would appear small in scale and proportionate to the host dwelling.  \r\rThe proposed porch would appear small in scale and subordinate to the host dwelling, therefore, would also not cause a significant change in character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The extension would sit at a similar height and depth as the existing single-storey rear extension at No.75 Orme Road, therefore the would not be a significant loss of daylight to the nearest habitable ground-floor window at No.75\r\rGiven the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
