    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the eastern elevations of the property unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows at First Floor or above in the eastern elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed rear extension would extend beyond the rear wall by a total depth of 6m, falling outside the guidance of 3.5m, as advised in the Residential Design SPD, this aspect of the development can be secured through a fallback position, as they have previously been granted permission to construct a single storey rear extension at the same height and depth under planning permission ref: 24/00637/PAEXT. Additionally, the proposal would respect the 4m pitched roof height set out in the guidance, in regards to character and appearance, it would not be visible in the street scene. \r\rThe proposed attached side extension would maintain approximately 800mm from the shared boundary, therefore, allowing access to the rear garden and maintaining separation distance from neighbouring property No.1B Forest Side.\r\rThe proposed porch would only maintain approximately 300mm distance from the existing bay window falling outside the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 38. However, the porch would be minor in scale and not significantly alter the overall appearance of the house. Additionally, it would appear subordinate and proportionate to the host dwelling and have a pitched roof that would mimic the pitched roof of the main dwelling.\r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development would not adversely impact the character or appearance of the area and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed rear extension would extend beyond the rear wall by a total depth of 6m, falling outside the guidance of 3.5m, as advised in the Residential Design SPD. Officers acknowledge that this aspect of the development can be secured through a fallback position, under planning permission ref: 24/00637/PAEXT. However, the details submitted under ref:24/00637/PAEXT also demonstrated that the proposed flat roof height would be approximately 3m which differed from the proposed total height of 3.4m (and a parapet wall of approximately 3.6m) under this application. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property No.2 Forest Side by reason of its overbearing appearance.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "All applications that involve extensions must provide \"45 Degree\" floor and elevation plans. These should be drawn at a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, they should accurately identify neighbouring building(s) and window(s) and when possible indicate the use of the room served by the window(s), and should be annotated to show the application of the 45 degree 'rule'. Please see the Householder Validation Local List for more information.\r",
    "Heritage Statement - The site address is within the Elmcroft Drive Local Area of Special Character, therefore please provide a Heritage Statement in line with the Householder Validation Local List requirement (see pages 33-35).\rAll planning applications are required to provide a Heritage Statement if they fall within the requirements of the Local List. The application for 33 Elmcroft Drive was for a Certificate of Lawful Development, not a planning application, and therefore did not need to meet the requirements of the Local List.\r"
