    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a large detached dwelling within the Southborough Conservation Area. The significance of the Southborough Conservation Area is as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash. \r\rProposal\rDemolition of an existing storm porch, erection of a single storey front porch and rear extension. Conversion of an existing garage into a habitable space. Fenestration alteration\r\rIt is noted that this application follows a recently refused application 24/01188/HOU dated 08.08.2024 for the conversion of  an existing garage into a habitable space, demolition of an existing storm porch and erection of a  single storey side porch extension. Fenestration alteration which was refused for the following reason;\r\r1) Insufficient information has been provided with regards to the proposed changes to fenestration. Officers have therefore been unable to confirm compliance with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2023).\r\rConfirmation of the proposed materials for window frames (including their manufacturer's specification, colour and texture) and also further details of the windows, including any aprons, sills, moulding's, heads, jambs, transoms, mullions, lintels or reveals ect were required and it was also noted within the report that Surbiton CAAC had objected to the proposal stating replacement windows within a conservation area should match existing and be timber framed and white in colour.\r\rIn order for this application to be successful, the applicant would need to satisfactorily address the previous reason for refusal \r\rConsultation\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received\r\rSurbiton CAAC - Objection - Replacement windows should match existing and be timber framed, white colour\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- Impact on a heritage asset;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed garage conversion and demolition and rebuild of the storm porch would be considered acceptable subject to the use of materials to match the existing which would be secured by condition should permission be granted. \r\rWith regards to the changes to the fenestration, while there are sustainability benefits to double glazing, it is likely that comparable benefits could be achieved through the installation of timber replacement windows, or through repairs to the existing windows. The proposed UPVC flush fit side hung casement windows would not be suitable for use within a conservation area and would result in an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As stated above, officers have established that due to the proposed matierals, there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore an impact on the Southborough Conservation Area.  It is therefore necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. The applicant has not advanced any arguments as to the public benefits of the proposal, nor is it apparent to Officers that there would be any. The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2024).\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A).  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side infill extension, with internal alterations and all associated works\r\rOfficers note that permission was receintly granted under 24/02432/HOU dated 18.12.2024 for the erection of single storey side/rear wraparound extension, first floor alterations, floor plan redesign and all associated works. Changes to first floor side fenestration.\r\rThe proposed application is for a much reduced scheme.\r\rConsultation\r8 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Flood Risk; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side/rear infill extension is set back from the front elevation and will not be readily visible within the streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, officers acknowledge the existing ground floor side windows of No. 42 The Bittoms, however, due to limited eaves height of 2.4m along the shared boundary coupled with the flat roof element the proposed infill/side extension would not result in an overbearing appearance or result in a detrimental loss of daylight sunlight to the nearest habitable room window. Due to the limited depth, no harm has been identified in relation to No. 46 The Bittoms. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 and 3A. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

    "The application relates to a 8 storey building known as the Double Tree hotel located on the west side of Skerne Road on the corner site of Skerne Road and Down Hall Road. The site is located in a predominantly residential area of high density high rise\rdevelopments. The site is not located in a conservation area.\r\rThere is a lengthy planning history for this site, the hotel was granted permission at appeal as part of a mixed use development for hotel and residential use (06/12424/FUL)\r\rProposal\r\rThe accompanying Planning Statement states: \r\rThe original design and construction teams installed insulation within the primary elevations and the courtyard/lightwell insulations which do not now meet the requirements and standards for non combustibility that must apply to buildings of this type and height. \rAll insulation currently present within the external walls must therefore be removed and replaced with non-combustible types. Where required additional vertical and horizontal fire barriers must also be installed. \r\rThese works will require the complete removal (and setting aside for re-fitting) of all the ceramic tile  cladding panels to the primary elevations, and the removal and setting aside of the coloured spandrel panels for re-fitting when all the existing insulation has been removed and replaced with non-combustible mineral fibre materials. \rThe type of ceramic tile cladding panels and their fixing systems require that every single panel is removed and refitted exactly in their current positions, with no change to their location (in any direction) otherwise the specially manufactured panels will no longer fit or be suitable for re-use.\r\rManufacture and supply of new & replacement matching panels is not a practical proposition therefore it will be a critical operation for the façade remediation contractors to identify and log all ceramic panels, remove them carefully, set aside and store safely, then carefully and precisely re fit them after the new insulation has been installed. \r\rThe same will be the case for all the coloured spandrel panels, though window panels in the curtain wall and glazing systems will not be affected.  Where sealants are required to be replaced with new they will be an exact match for existing in colour, texture and size to ensure they fit within all the re-fitted elements. \r\rThe site operations required to achieve the removal and refitting of surface elements are exacting and complex and the selected contractor team are experienced and successful in this type of operation (and façade remediation of HRBs and other building types). \r\rIn summary the replacement insulation is being carried out entirely due to fire safety reasons and the works would not result in a change to the external appearance of the building other than cleaning up of the existing panels before refitting. \r\rConsultation\r162 addresses were notified directly by way of a letter and site notice was displayed near the site on 12.03.2025. No responses have been received. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would result in no discernable change to the external appearance of the building. As such,it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
