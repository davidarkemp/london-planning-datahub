    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and the installation of 2no. rooflights to the front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks to make the following changes to the original planning application ref no 21/02351/HOU for 'Erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion': \r- to change of the rear window on the dormer to a Juliet balcony\r- the submitted plans, when compared with the approved ones, suggest reduction of the total height from approximately 2.3m to 2.1m and a different set down distance from the existing roof ridge: from approximately 26cm (as per approved plans) to 21cm (as per amended plans) \r\rIt is considered that the proposed amendments (due to their siting and scale) would not give rise to amenity or design/character and appearance considerations. As such the proposed amendment is considered as non-material.\r\rConditions imposed via the original planning permission ref no 21/02351/HOU would still apply.\r",
