    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling, would unduly erode the gap to 9 Keswick Avenue, and would appear as an incongruous feature within the Keswick Avenue street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
