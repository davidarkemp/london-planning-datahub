As such, the change in use of the integral garage to habitable space would not amount to development requiring planning permission.\r\rThe alterations to the front of the dwelling, to accommodate the change in use of the garage, would make a material alteration to the appearance of the front of the dwelling house and as such amount to development requiring planning permission. However, the proposed changes would fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
