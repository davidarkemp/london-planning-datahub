    "The development to which this decision relates must begin within a period of 3 years starting with the prior approval date.\r\rReason: This is required by paragraph C.2(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "Within one month of this consent being granted a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority providing details of a cleaning and maintenance schedule of all filters and odour abatement equipment.  This should include the submission of details of a maintenance contract with a suitably competent contractor.  The scheme shall comply with the maintenance requirements stated in Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems\" published by EMAQ dated September 2018\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The rating level of the noise from the kitchen extract system hereby permitted shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation.  The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade.  Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014.\r\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall operate only between the hours of 09:00 to 22:00 Monday to Sunday, with all staff to leave the premises by 22:30 hours.\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect the subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies 5.17 and 7.4 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the commencement of the use, a delivery and service plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved plan.\r\rReason: To ensure proper delivery and service management in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), the premises shall only be used for the purposes specified in the application documents and for no other purposes whatsoever (including any other purposes falling within Part 3 Class C E(b) of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (or any provision equivalent to that class in any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification)).\r\rReason: The acceptability of the development is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the use of the site and other uses, whether within the same use class or permitted by the General Permitted Development Order, are unlikely to be acceptable in planning terms.",
    "The proposal would comply with the criteria of Class C of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
