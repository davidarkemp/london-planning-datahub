    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide satisfactory living conditions for current and/or future occupiers of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of off-street car parking facilities and absence of an executed Unilateral Undertaking to ensure that the development is car capped i.e. current and/or future occupants of the development would not be able to obtain car parking permits, would be highly likely to lead to inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets, which would, in turn, compromise highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed window to the western elevation would not be in keeping with the proportions of the fenestration to the property and would introduce a relatively modern style of window to the building. The refuse/recycling and cycle stores area in terms of materiality of the enclosures would not be of a sufficiently high quality and would fail to preserve, enhance or better reveal the conservation area. Similarly, the garden areas and associated boundary treatment would serve to diminish the setting of the conservation area. The proposals would result in less than substantial harm to the locally listed building and Old Malden conservation area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraphs 130, 197, 203, 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021."
