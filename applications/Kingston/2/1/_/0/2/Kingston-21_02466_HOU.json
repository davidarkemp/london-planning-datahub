    "The proposed ground floor extension, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 10 Beechcroft Avenue. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No.10 Beechcroft Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
