All details shall be in accordance with British Standard BS5837: 2012 \"Trees in relation to Design, Demolition and Construction\"\r\rThe approved protection scheme shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site including demolition, and be maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development or until such stage as detailed within the approved AMS.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective."
