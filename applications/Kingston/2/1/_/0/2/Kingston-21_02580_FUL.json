    "The proposed upper floor flat would be substandard in size and the ground floor flat would have a poor layout with very deep floor plates. Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed flats would benefit from dedicated private or communal amenity space. The proposed flats would be of a poor standard of accommodation and would conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of  sufficiently precise plans that the proposed car parking would be of sufficient size and how it would be allocated between the proposed flats. Insufficient information has therefore been submitted to conclude that the proposed development would not give rise to overspill car parking which could adversely impact on-street car parking stress. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013."
