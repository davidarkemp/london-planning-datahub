    "By reason of its mass, height and design, the proposed side extension would not appear subordinate to the original dwellinghouse. In addition, by reason of its scale and design, the proposed single storey front extension would appear an incongruous addition to the dwellinghouse. Therefore the proposal would conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed decking to the rear of the site would have an unacceptable impact on the privacy of the neighbouring property at 20 Wilson Road through overlooking, conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
