    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would allow for adequate daylight/sunlight penetration to the internal living accommodation. As such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed accommodation would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of internal floor space and built in storage space for one-storey 1-bed, 2-person units as set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The external amenity space serving the first floor flat would represent a poor quality amenity area in terms of usability owing to its size below Council's standards, siting to the front of the building and configuration with shared function as a cycle and refuse storage area. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The applicant has provided insufficient/incomplete information to allow for the full and proper assessment of the impacts of the proposed development on neighbouring occupiers amenity. The proposals are therefore assessed as contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in the loss of/displacement of the car parking provision serving the commercial unit to the ground floor of No. 90 Leatherhead Road and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
