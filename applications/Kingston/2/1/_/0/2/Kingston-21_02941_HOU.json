    "By reason of its excessive height, combined with its depth and siting along the shared boundary, the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight of the nearest ground floor habitable room at 3 Oaklea Passage. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 1A Oaklea Passage. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its height, the proposed extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the original dwellinghouse, and would therefore have an unacceptable impact on its character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2021."
