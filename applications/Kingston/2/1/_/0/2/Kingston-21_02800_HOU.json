    "The proposed rear extensions (first floor and dormer) by virtue of their size, siting and design would individually and cumulatively create an incongruous addition to the host property that would create a dominant and overbearing feature at the rear of the property and be visually intrusive in the private views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed development as such would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy and Policy Guidance 34 and 39 of the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013."
