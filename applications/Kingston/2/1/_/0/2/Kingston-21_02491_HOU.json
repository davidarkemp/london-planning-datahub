    "By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no.85 Ullswater Crescent, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the  adjoining property at no.85 Ullswater Crescent. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
