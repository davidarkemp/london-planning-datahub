    "The excessive scale and siting of the proposed extensions at first and second floor levels, would represent an unsatisfactory form of development, and one that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the surrounding area to the detriment of the streetscene.  The proposed development, by reason of the scale, form, siting and design of the extensions, would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Area of Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\r\r",
    "Due to the scale and siting of the proposed balconies at first and second floor levels, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring properties, in particular, Nos. 106 and 100 Park Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
