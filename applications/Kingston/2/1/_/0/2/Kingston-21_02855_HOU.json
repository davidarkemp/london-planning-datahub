    "Given the siting, height and depth of the proposed ground floor rear extension, it would not pass the 45-degree test in relation to the closest habitable windows at No.33 Alric Avenue at ground floor level, as such officers consider that the proposed development would unduly compromise the amenities of No. 33 Alric Avenue, by reason of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of height and depth, the proposed ground floor rear extension would appear excessive in scale and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the immediate surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
