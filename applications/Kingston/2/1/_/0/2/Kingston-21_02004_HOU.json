    "The proposed style, siting and excessive size of the proposed windows, and the use of render for the facing and flank elevations in relation to the rear dormer roof extension would not be in keeping with, or relate well to the existing dwelling, resulting in an incongruous form of development.  It is also considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.",
    "Due to the siting and excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension (approximately 7.8m) along the shared boundary with No. 11 Selwyn Road it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No. 11 Selwyn Road by reason of overbearing appearance and undue sense of enclosure, thereby conficting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013."
