    "The proposed development, by reason of the increased roof ridge height and form and siting of the proposed two side roof extensions, would harm the appearance of the host dwellinghouse and appear as an incongruous feature within the Woodlands Avenue street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and less than substantial harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset (Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character) in which the dwelling is located. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraphs 130 and 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document."
