    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation and outlook for future occupiers by virtue of the predominantly single-aspect layout. Based on the information submitted, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "By virtue of its siting, size and height, the proposed dwellings would have an adverse impact upon the living conditions of the owners/occupiers of Nos. 38, 40 and 44 Penrith Road, in terms of overbearing impact, loss of outlook, overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would undermine the provision of private amenity space for the existing occupiers at No.42 and 42A Penrith Road, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 and Policy DM13 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed development would not provide for adequate means of cycle storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that refuse collection vehicles, emergency service vehicles and other servicing/delivery vehicles could safely enter and exit the site without prejudicing highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Paragraph 110 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable parking stress on street parking which would have a harmful effect on highway safety in the area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with Paragraph 110 of the NPPF, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012)."
