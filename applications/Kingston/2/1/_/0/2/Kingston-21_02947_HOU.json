    "The proposed hip-to-gable roof extension with rear dormer roof extension would not relate well to the host property and would unbalance the roofs of the semi-detached properties and as such would appear incongruous within the immediate surrounding area, thereby resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the Fairfield/Knights Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
