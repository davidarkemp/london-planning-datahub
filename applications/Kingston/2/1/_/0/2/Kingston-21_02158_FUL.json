    "The proposal would involve the loss of an existing office in a location within Kingston Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. No robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the property has been actively marketed. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2021) and Policy DM17 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation for future occupiers by virtue of the undersized floorspace provided to Flat 2 of the proposed scheme which would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards for a 1bed, 2person unit. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Two of the proposed residential units are not provided with any external amenity space, which is contrary to Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would not provide adequate means of cycle storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012."
