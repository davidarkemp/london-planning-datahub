    "By reason of its siting along the boundary, the proposed single-storey rear extension would have an overbearing impact on the neighbouring property at No. 10, 11 and 12 Beverley Cottages, contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the London Plan (2021).",
    "By reason of its excessive height, in conjunction with its depth and unusual roof form, the proposed single storey rear extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate in relation to the original dwellinghouse. Consequently, it is considered that the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Vale Conservation Area and there are no public benefits associated with the proposed development. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
