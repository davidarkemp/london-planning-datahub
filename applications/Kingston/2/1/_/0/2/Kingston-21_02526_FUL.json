    "The proposals are out of keeping with surrounding development by virtue of the proposed materiality and the introduction of off-street car parking to the frontage. The proposals would have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area and lead to the loss of the characteristic wide grass verge along Lovelace Road. The proposals are therefore contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers (Caroline Court to the south of the application site) in terms of overshadowing. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 24 of the Residential Design Guide 2013.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate private and communal amenity space below required space standards for new developments, contrary to Policy Guidance 14 of the Residential Design Guide 2013, Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking that would fail to promote sustainable modes of transport that limit car use and could lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Paragraphs 110, 111 and 124 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
