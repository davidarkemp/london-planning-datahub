In the absence of very special circumstances being demonstrated that would individually, or cumulatively outweigh the substantial weight to given to the harm to the Green Belt and the other harm identified, the development proposed would not accord with paragraphs 147 - 151 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021 and Policies CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
