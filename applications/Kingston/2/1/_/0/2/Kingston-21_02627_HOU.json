    "By reason of its height, bulk, massing and proximity to the shared boundary with no. 19 Manorgate Road, the proposed first floor side extension would appear as a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, which would erode an existing gap between two properties in Manorgate Road and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Kingston Council Residential Design SPD1."
