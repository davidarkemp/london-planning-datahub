    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development at first and second floor level would pass the 45-degree test in relation to the closest habitable room windows at No. 37 and 33 Elton Road at first floor level, and that it would not have an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of light/sunlight. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed increase in the main roof ridge would not unbalance the consistent roofscape of the existing terraced houses and would not result in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene.  As such, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the area and conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
