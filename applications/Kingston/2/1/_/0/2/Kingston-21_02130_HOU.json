    "By reason of its height, bulk and massing the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling and would not respect the prevailing pattern of development or roofscape within the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed additional single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring properties at are Nos.7 and 11 Amberwood Rise, by reason of an unacceptable loss of daylight, increase in the sense of enclosure and  loss of outlook to these  adjoining properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
