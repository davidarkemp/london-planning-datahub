    "The proposed front boundary treatment in terms of its height, scale, design and siting would be an incongruous addition to the property and would also be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the Woodlands Road streetscene and the Southborough Conservation Area. The proposal would also result in less than substantial harm to the character and appearance and significance of the Southborough Conservation Area which is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
