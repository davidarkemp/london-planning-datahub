    "The proposed development, by reason of the excessive bulk, scale, the removal of the chimney, and the mass of the raised roof, would have an unacceptable adverse impact on character and appearance of the host dwelling and would result in a harmful and incongruous addition within the streetscene thereby harming its character and appearance. The development would thereby conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
