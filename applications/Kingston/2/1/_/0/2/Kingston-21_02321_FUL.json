    "The proposal would result in a cramped and contrived form of development and have the appearance of being \"shoehorned\" into the site. It would also disrupt the hierarchical plot arrangement on this site which is a characteristic feature of the Southborough Conservation Area, serve to undermine the prominence of Genesis House in its setting and be out of keeping with, and detract from, the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and fail to preserve or enhance the Conservation Area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Paragraphs 130, 197, 203, 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation and outlook for future occupiers by virtue of the predominantly single-aspect, north-facing orientation of the dwelling. The external amenity space would represent a poor quality amenity area in terms of usability owing to its size, siting and configuration. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling, due to its proximity to Genesis House and the location of the proposed dormer window, would appear as an overly-enclosing, visually intrusive structure resulting in overlooking between habitable rooms and cause an unacceptable loss of outlook and loss of privacy to the adjacent ground floor and first floor flats of Genesis House, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Tree Survey or Tree Protection Plan to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm to the health and longevity of the nearby large trees. The proposed dwelling, due to its proximity to mature trees near the southern and eastern boundaries of the site would likely result in pressure from the future occupier of the house to significantly refuse the size of these Conservation Area tree to allow additional light and ventilation into the house, or for reasons of structural integrity. This would be harmful to the form of the trees and their contribution to the wider character of the Conservation Area and, as such, the development would conflict with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
