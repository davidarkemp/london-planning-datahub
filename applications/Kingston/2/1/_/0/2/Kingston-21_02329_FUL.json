    "The proposed replacement dwelling would be of an excessive scale and bulk which would be a prominent and incongruous feature within the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. It has not been robustly demonstrated that the proposed development could be delivered, and accessed by occupants, without significant harm to mature trees and landscaping which make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. The proposed development fails to preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area and would cause less than substantial harm to its significance which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal is contrary to Policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021), Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and Paragraph 2022 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "No comprehensive details of the proposed access arrangements to the site have been submitted and it has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed on-site car parking could be accessed by vehicles. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that safe access to the site for construction vehicles could be achieved. The lack of a tangible access solution/strategy for the proposed development means that it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not adversely impact on-street car parking stress (which could cause a highway safety and neighbouring amenity issue) and that construction works would not adversely impact highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The submitted Arboricultural Information and Habitat & Ecology Surveys fail to fully assess the impact of the proposed development in that they are limited to the site boundary and do not assess the impact of the works required to provide a vehicular access to the site at both the construction and post-development phases. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposals would not result in significant harm to, or loss of, trees or habitat within the Fishponds Park Conservation Area, Local Open Space and Site of Nature Conservation Interest. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The Protection of Badgers Act (1992) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021)."
