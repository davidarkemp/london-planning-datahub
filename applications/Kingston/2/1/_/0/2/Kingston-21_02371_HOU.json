    "The proposed roof extensions, including the hipped roof extension, and dormer extensions to the side and rear, by reason of their scale, form, bulk, mass, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling and would visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed dormer window to the side, by reason of its siting, would have an unacceptable impact on the privacy of a principal room window of the neighbouring property at 6 Bowness Crescent. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
