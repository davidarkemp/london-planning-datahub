    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at numbers 4 and 6 Meadow Hill, New Malden. One of the proposed rear dormer extensions, by virtue of its design, size and siting, would fail to appear as a subservient addition. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 and paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013)."
