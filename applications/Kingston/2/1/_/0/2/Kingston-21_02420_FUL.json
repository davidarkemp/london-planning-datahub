    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a travel plan comprising immediate, continuing and long-term measures to promote and encourage alternatives to single-occupancy car use shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved plan shall then be implemented and monitored to the satisfaction of the local planning authority, having regard to the targets contained within it. \r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), the premises shall only be used for as a dental surgery and for no other purposes whatsoever (including any other purposes falling within Use Class E(e) of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (or any provision equivalent to that class in any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification).\r\rReason: The acceptability of the development is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the use of the site and other uses, whether within the same use class or permitted by the General Permitted Development Order, are unlikely to be acceptable in planning terms.",
    "The dentist practice use to which this permission relates shall not open outside of the following hours:\r\rMonday to Friday - 08:30 - 17:00 (with the exception of emergency appointments to 19:00)\rSaturdays - 08:30 - 13:00 (with the exception of emergency appointments to  17:00)\r\rFor the purposes of this condition, 'emergency appointments' are defined as for patients who require emergency care and require immediate attention in order to minimise the risk of serious medical complications, or prevent long-term dental complications.\r\rThe dental surgery is required to keep records of emergency appointments, which shall be available to the Council for inspection (upon request) and in order to monitor the appropriate use of the dental surgery during the hours specified.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of secure cycle parking facilities (for 2 no. long stay spaces and 3 no. short stay spaces) to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rThe cycle parking facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained for that purpose and kept free from obstruction thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, a noise assessment of current and proposed operations at the Groves Dental Centre shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The report shall also assess any potential noise impact to the upper floor residential properties at the site as a result of the proposed development hereby permitted.\r\rIf the assessment indicates that noise from existing or proposed operations at the Groves Dental Centre is likely to affect neighbouring occupiers of the upper floor residential properties, the report shall detail appropriate mitigation measures to ensure that the guidance noise levels in table 4 of BS8233:2014 are achieved. \r\rThe approved mitigated measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of development and be permanently retained thereafter. The report shall be authored by a suitable qualified acoustic consultant.\r\rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policies D3 and D14 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
