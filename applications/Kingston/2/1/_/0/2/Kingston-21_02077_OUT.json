    "The substandard access would prejudice the condition of highway safety, the proposal would also lead to conflict between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles. There has been limited information submitted regarding deliveries and servicing and emergency vehicle access to the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (Adopted April 2012).",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, Tree Survey or Tree Protection Plan to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm to the health and longevity, or wholesale loss of, the nearby large trees. As such, the development would conflict with Paragraph 131 of the NPPF 2021, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (Adopted April 2012).",
    "Inadequate information has been submitted for officers to properly consider the impacts of the proposed development on ecology. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 174 of the NPPF 2021, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (Adopted April 2012).",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of an Air Quality Assessment. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 186 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies SI2 and SI3 of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of an Inclusive Design Statement to demonstrate that the proposed scheme would include appropriate high quality, accessible and inclusive design measures to serve the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies D5 and Policy D7 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to enter into a legal agreement to prevent future occupiers from applying for residents parking permits, and so the proposal has the potential to generate unacceptable highways congestion and safety concerns. As such, the proposal in this respect is considered to conflict with Paragarp 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 (Adopted April 2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate an identified, proven need for the proposed student accommodation on this site, and there is no supporting binding nomination agreement with Kingston University or any other higher education provider within the Borough to commit to providing housing for its students. As such the proposal fails to accord with Policy H15 of the London Plan, 2021 and policies CS10 and CS15 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed quality of the student accommodation is considered substandard, due to 6no.of the proposed 29no. units being undersized against local policy guidance for this type of accommodation. As such, the proposal in contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and Policy Guidance 46 of the Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed development would not provide the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021. As such, the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents and the proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 (Adopted April 2012).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation in respect of adequate natural light ingress for future occupiers by virtue of those rooms which are single-aspect, north-facing and which equate to 38% of the total proposed rooms. The proposal would be contrary to Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The proposed development by reason of its layout providing solely studio units and the lack of satisfactory communal facilities to serve as ancillary, supporting functions is considered to result in poor quality accommodation, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and Policy Guidance 46 of the Residential Design SPD 2013."
