The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed dormer would have a contrived appearance which would not complement the character of the existing building and wider area and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the existing building and the wider area, contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD (2013), Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021)."
