    "The proposed development is inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have a detrimental impact on openness due to the harm to the rural character of the site and wider area that would arise from the change of use from equestrian to residential. No Very Special Circumstances exist which would clearly outweigh the identified harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM5 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012),  Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would result in a net loss of employment floorspace and no sound evidence and rigorous marketing has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses, contrary to Policy DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed dwellinghouses would be isolated homes in the countryside and would be over reliant on the car as a mode of transport due to the 'worst' Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of the site and the car parking provision which would exceed the maximum standards within the London Plan (2021). The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Notwithstanding the in principle objection, the Gross Internal Area (GIA) of House 2 would significantly exceed the minimum GIA standards set out in Table 3.1, Policy D6, of the London Plan (2021) and it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would make the most efficient use of the land, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "In the absence of an Archaeological Assessment specific to the proposed development it has not been robustly demonstrated that the proposed development would not have any significant adverse impact on any archaeological remains on site, contrary to Policy DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
