    "The combined depth and siting of the proposed extension are considered not to represent a development that respects the existing pattern of development, and the built form of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The excessive depth of the proposed ground floor extension, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the adjoining property, No. 8 Landseer Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
