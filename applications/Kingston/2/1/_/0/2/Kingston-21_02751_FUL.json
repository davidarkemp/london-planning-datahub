    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate communal amenity space below required space standards for new developments, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 14 of the Residential Design Guide,2013.",
    "The proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
