    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Before the use hereby permitted commences an acoustic report shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority demonstrating that the rating level of any plant, permitted as part of this development, will be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade. Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of residential occupiers in accordance with policy DM10 (Design Requirements of New Development including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not commence until full details, with calculations, of the proposed extraction system have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The submission shall include, where applicable, details of:\r\r(i) The extract fan, attenuators (it is recommended that the infill is protected by Melinex polyester film), anti-vibration mounts, high velocity cowl, filters, odour abatement and any other items of plant;\r(ii) The velocity of the air at final discharge and duct termination height and location\r(iii) The retention time of gases in the carbon filters (where applicable);\r(iv) A maintenance schedule;\r(v) A completion of an risk assessment of odour and demonstration of compliance with \"Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems\" published by EMAQ+ dated September 2018, which replaced the previous Defra guidance, now withdrawn.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to the commencement of development because the details would affect the subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to safeguard the amenities of residential occupiers in accordance with policy DM10 (Design Requirements of New Development including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Before commencement of the approved use, the approved extraction system shall be installed on site in accordance with the approved details and shall be retained and maintained thereafter. Any variations thereafter shall be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of residential occupiers in accordance with policy DM10 (Design Requirements of New Development including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
