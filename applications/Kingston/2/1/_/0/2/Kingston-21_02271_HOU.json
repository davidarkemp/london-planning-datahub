    "The extension in ridge height, bulky appearance of the gable roofs in relation to the original roof form, the substantial increase in glazing and inappropriate use of columns and balcony to the front elevation, as well as the roof extensions and alterations with increased glazing to the existing garage would combine to form an incongruous addition to the original dwelling that would not relate well to the host property or the prevailing form and pattern of development in the area, thereby resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking into the habitable rooms of Petworth Lodge, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Given that the applicant has not sufficiently demonstrated that the proposal would not cause adverse harm to the existing protected trees on site, the proposed development is contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
