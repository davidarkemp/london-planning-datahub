    "The applicant has failed to justify the removal of the existing Birch tree protected by a TPO, failed to ensure the health and longevity of the x4 Cypress trees (also protected by a TPO) and not provided any details of replacement trees on site which would have a detrimental adverse impact on both the trees in question and the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area, thereby conflicting with Policies G7 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to the unjustified removal of the existing Birch tree, failure to ensure the health and longevity of the Cypress trees and failure to provide any details of replacement trees on site, the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area, a designated heritage asset. Furthermore, there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm. As such the proposed development would conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 .",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate how the elevated patios, hard landscaping and entertainment areas within the rear garden would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overlooking and loss of privacy. As such the proposed development is considered to conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
