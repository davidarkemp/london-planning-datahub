    "Due to the proposed combination of excessive scale and siting of the extensions at ground, first and second floor levels, the proposed development would represent an overdevelopment of the application property, and a development that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the streetscene or surrounding area and would therefore fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.  The additions and alterations at first floor level to the side and rear of the application property, in particular, would be uncharacteristic of the built form of surrounding properties and the Southborough Conservation Area. The proposal therefore conflicts with Paragraphs 199 to 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposed first floor side extension by virtue of its combined siting and scale, would create an incongruous and visually bulky addition to the host property that would detract from the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding Conservation Area. In particular, when viewed from the neighbouring property at No. 45 Langley Avenue (Bourne House). The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021)."
