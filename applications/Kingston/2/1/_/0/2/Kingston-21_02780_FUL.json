    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08:00 and 13:00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenity of the neighbours by minimising impacts of the development that would otherwise give rise to nuisance in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Before the development hereby approved commences, a Construction Environmental Management Plan (CEMP) shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority. The CEMP shall comprise measures for controlling the effects of demolition, construction and enabling works associated with the development as may be approved by the Local Planning Authority. The CEMP shall address issues including the phasing of the works, air quality, noise, waste management, site remediation, plant and equipment, site transportation and traffic management including routing, signage, permitted hours for construction traffic and construction materials deliveries. It will ensure appropriate communication with, the distribution of information to the local community and the Local Planning Authority relating to relevant aspects of construction. Appropriate arrangements should be made for monitoring and responding to complaints relating to demolition and construction. All demolition, construction and enabling work at the development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved CEMP unless otherwise agreed in writing by the LPA.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase in order to protect air quality, safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with Policies CS7 and DM9, DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy SI 1 of the London Plan and the GLA SPG Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction.\r"
