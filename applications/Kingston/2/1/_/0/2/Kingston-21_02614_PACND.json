    "The proposed development would be an inelegant and bulky addition which would be highly incongruous in an area where development is largely at the two-storey level. The resulting building would appear visually intrusive and incongruous and would not be sympathetic to local character or the surrounding built environment and would not add to the overall quality of the area contrary to the NPPF (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Condition A.A.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The floor to ceiling height of the additional storey, measured internally, would exceed the floor to ceiling height, measured internally, of a storey of the principal part of the existing building. The development is therefore not permitted, as set out in A.1(e)(ii) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the General Permitted Development Order (2015) (as amended)."
