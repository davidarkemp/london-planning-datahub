    "The proposed development together with the existing enlargement by virtue of its mass and bulk and siting would create a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling resulting in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area.

    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would provide adequate private outdoor amenity space for the existing and future occupiers of the property, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
