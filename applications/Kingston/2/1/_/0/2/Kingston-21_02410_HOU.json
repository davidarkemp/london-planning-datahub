    "The addition of an extension on an extension would cumulatively by virtue of its size, siting and design create an incongruous addition to the rear of the host property that would not be subordinate and would be a disproportionate and unweildly addition to the host property that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and be visually intrusive in the views of the property in the private views from the rear of the neighboruing properties. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
