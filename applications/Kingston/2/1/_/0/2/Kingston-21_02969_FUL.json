    "The proposal would result in a cramped and contrived form of development and have the appearance of being \"shoehorned\" into the site. It would also erode the spaciousness of this plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and as such detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development would fail to meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021. As such, the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents, contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation and outlook for future occupiers by virtue of the predominantly single-aspect, north-facing orientation of the dwelling. In addition, there is no technical Daylight and Sunlight Report to demonstrate adequate daylight and sunlight levels to the proposed dwellinghouse. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment or Tree Protection Plan to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm to the health and longevity of the nearby large tree located within the rear garden of No. 38 Cox Lane, contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "No information has been submitted in the form of a Basement Impact Assessment to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable harm to local groundwater conditions or result in structural instability, contrary to Policy Guidance 43 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013."
