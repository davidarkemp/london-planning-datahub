    "Due to the inadequate setback and the siting of the proposed piggyback roof extension, the proposed development would appear prominently on the existing dwelling, and would appear visually dominant  and incongruous in the streetscene, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not unduly compromise the amenities of No. 28 Elm Road by reason of loss of light/sunlight to the nearest principal habitable room window at first floor level in the southern elevation. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
