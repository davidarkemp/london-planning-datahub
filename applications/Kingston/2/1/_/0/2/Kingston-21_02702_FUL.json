The development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the construction management plan, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period.\r\rReason: This information is required prior to the commencement of development in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic from the outset, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method statement.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard drainage systems in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "A sample of the facing materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted, including details of the balustrading for the rooftop terrace, shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any works above ground level are commenced on site.

The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised.\r\rReason: In order to protect future occupiers against traffic, commercial, and railway noise",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows in the side (north-east) elevation and situated on the first and second floor shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level.\r\rReason: In order to protect the amenities of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
