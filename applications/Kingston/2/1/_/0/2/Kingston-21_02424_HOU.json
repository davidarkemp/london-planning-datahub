    "The excessive scale and siting of the proposed single storey rear extension, would represent an unsatisfactory form of development, and one that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the surrounding area.   The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.\r\r\r\r",
    "Due to the siting and excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension (6m) along the shared boundary with No.  Bakewell Road it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No. Bakewell Way by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of outlook and an undue sense of enclosure, thereby conficting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013."
