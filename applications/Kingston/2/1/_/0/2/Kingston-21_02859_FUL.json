    "The proposal does not constitute good design and would relate poorly to the existing fenestration at first floor level and ultimately detract from the character and appearance of the host building. Moreover, and notwithstanding, the plans are inaccurate and cannot be relied upon to implement the proposals to a satisfactory standard. The proposals are therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
