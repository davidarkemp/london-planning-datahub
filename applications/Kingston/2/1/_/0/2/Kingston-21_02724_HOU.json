    "By reason of its siting along the shared boundary, the proposed development would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No.193 Kings Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 193 Kings Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
