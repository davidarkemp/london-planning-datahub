    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its excessive scale and siting, would dominate and unabalance the pair of semi-detached properties at Nos. 2 and 4 Manor Way, thereby resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The excessive depth of the proposed ground floor extension, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue loss of outlook daylight/sunlight and sense of enclosure to the adjoining property, No.6 Manor Way. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
