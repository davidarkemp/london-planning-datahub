    "By reason of its excessive depth, the proposed first floor rear extension would result in an unacceptable level of overbearing and an undue sense of enclosure to neighbouring properties, Nos. 41 and 45 Ditton Road, particularly the nearest first floor window of No. 45 Ditton Road.  Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
