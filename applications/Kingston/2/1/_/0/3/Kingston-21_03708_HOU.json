    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of its excessive scale, insufficent set down from the main roof ridge, set back from the front elevation and set in from the shared boundary would be unacceptable in terms of form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and that of the surrounding area and be visually intrusive in the streetscene. The proposal would not accord with D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
