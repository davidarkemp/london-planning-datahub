    "The proposed development would result in an incongruous roof form, resulting in unacceptable harm in terms of character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 & DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The excessive depth and height of the proposed two storey rear extension along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of No. 27 Latchmere Lane, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
