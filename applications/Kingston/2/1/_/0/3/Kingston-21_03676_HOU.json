    "By reason of its excessively bulky appearance and flat roof forms the proposed development is considered not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the immediate surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Park Road Conservation Area. This harm would not be outweighed against any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The siting and proximity of the proposed roof terrace to the shared boundary would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of neighbouring property, No. 24 Brunswick Road in terms of loss of privacy/overlooking. Additionally, the applicant has failed to provide sufficient details as to the proposed boundary treatment of the roof terrace and has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed increase in height of the single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 24 Brunswick Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8 andDM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residnetial Design SPD (2013)."
