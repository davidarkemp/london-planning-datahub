    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, detailed information and including the following:\r\r-dimensions;\r-colour; and,\r-texture,\r\rof the proposed materials for the garden room and pergola to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details prior to occupation and thereafter permanently retained.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no additions or enlargements to any dwellinghouse(s) on the site (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) shall be erected unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no detached buildings (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) shall be erected on the site unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary, or incidental, or both, to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '3 Grand Avenue, Surbiton, KT5 9HU', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form, signed 09.10.2021 and shall not be used for sleeping accommodation, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation/sleeping accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in terms of residential amenity, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
