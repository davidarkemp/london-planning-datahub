    "The applicant requested removal of the tree on the basis that the roots of the tree were damaging the tarmac of the tennis courts by lifting and cracking. When I visited the site to inspect the damage and consider the application I found that YMCA had employed a company to carry out works to fix the issue by recompacting the surface with the use of a heavy roller allowing them to then redress the tarmac. As this presents a workable solution that does not necessitate the removal of the tree, permission is refused for the trees removal subject to this application."
