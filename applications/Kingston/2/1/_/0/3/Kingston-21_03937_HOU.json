    "By reason of scale, mass and design, the proposed raising of roof extension and excessive depth of the L shaped roof extension would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would detract from the character and appearance of the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene and surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The scale and excessive depth of the proposed roof extensions, would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue loss of outlook and sense of enclosure to the adjoining properties at Nos.27 and 31 Gibbon Road.  The applicant has also failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to No.s 27 and 31 Gibbon Road and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook to those windows. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012\r\r\r\r"
