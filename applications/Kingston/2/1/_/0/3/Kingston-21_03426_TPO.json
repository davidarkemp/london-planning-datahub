    "Although subsidence has been demonstrated at the applicant address, the investigations undertaken and provided in support of this application, provide no evidence that the two trees subject to this application and protected by a TPO are implicated in the movement of the soil. This is clearly stated in their own submission as follows:\r\r\"Whilst not implicated by positive roots analysis, it is our opinion that, T4 (Elder), T5 (Yew) and T6 (False Acacia) also retain the clear capacity to be extending roots proximate to the focal area of movement it is our opinion on balance of probability that roots from the above vegetation will also be in proximity to the footings of the insured property.\"\r\rThe capacity to grow roots within an area does not mean that a tree will grow roots in this area, this is merely supposition and not grounds for the removal of a protected tree. As the involvement of these trees is not substantiated the Council will not provide permission for their removal.\r"
