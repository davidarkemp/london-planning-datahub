    "By reason of its excessive height, in conjunction with its depth and flat roof form, the proposed single storey rear extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate in relation to the original dwellinghouse. In addition the design and excessive size of the arched windows would not relate well to the host dwelling or the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. Consequently, it is considered that the proposed development would result to less than sustantial harm to the significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area and there are no public benefits associated with the proposed development. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "The installation of a window on the side elevation of the proposed single storey side extension would have an unacceptable impact on the privacy of both the occupiers of the application site, and the neighbouring property at No. 29 Tudor Road, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
