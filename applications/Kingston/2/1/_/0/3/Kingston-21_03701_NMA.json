    "Condition 17 of 17/16547/FUL is amended as follows:\r\rPrior to the commencement of works (excluding demolition and site investigations), the applicant must submit a final detailed sustainable drainage design including drawings to the Lead Local Flood Authority for review and approval to demonstrate that surface water runoff rates will be restricted to as close to greenfield conditions as possible as per the submitted February 2018 Micro Drainage calculations. A detailed drainage maintenance plan must be submitted which shows that each drainage feature will be suitably managed for the lifetime of the development, confirming responsible owner(s). Where amendments have been made from the September 2017 Flood Risk Assessment proposal, revised calculations and an updated Drainage Assessment Form must be submitted. \r\rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with relevant policy requirements including but not limited to London Plan Policy 5.13, it's associated Sustainable Design and Construction SPG, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems and Kingston Council's Core Strategy Policy DM4."
