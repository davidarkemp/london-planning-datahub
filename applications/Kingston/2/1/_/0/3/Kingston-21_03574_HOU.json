    "The proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, form, siting and design would appear as an excessive, disproportionate and incongruous addition to the dwelling, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed two storey rear extension would comply with BRE Guidance and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook from the nearest habitable room windows of No.25 and No. 29 Hunters Road. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
