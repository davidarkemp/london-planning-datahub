    "The proposal would erode the spaciousness of the existing plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development by reason of it scale and siting would adversely impact the amenities of No. 54 Fullers Avenue through visual dominance, loss of outlook and sense of overbearing when viewed from the rear garden area and would adversely impact the amenities of No. 58 Fullers Avenue through visual dominance, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and overlooking, contrary to the policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonsrate through the submission of cogent information that the removal / displacement of the existing property's off-street parking provision would not lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network, lead to inconsiderate parking and have an unacceptable impact on highway safety in the immediate surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
