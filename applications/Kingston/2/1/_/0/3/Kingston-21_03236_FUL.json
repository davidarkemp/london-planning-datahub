Variation to include replacing skylight to the loft front elevation to dormer matching the side and rear elevations",
  "decision_conditions": [
    "By reason of the proposed introduction of a dormer window to the front roof slope, the proposed development would be detrimental to the design quality of the approved development and cause harm to the character and appearance of the application building and the surrounding Riverside South Conservation Area as it would be visually incongruous.  Albeit less than substantially, the harm caused by this proposal is not outweighed by any public benefits, thereby contravening Paragraphs 199 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, 2021  and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012."
