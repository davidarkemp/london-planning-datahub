    "Due to its lack of set down from the roof ridge and set back from the front elevation, the proposed first floor side extension, along with the front elevation gable feature and rear dormer by reason of its siting, design and massing would appear overly dominant in relation to the host dwelling. In combination with the proposed alterations to the style of windows and loss of hanging tiles to the front elevation the proposed development would represent an incongruous form of development which would also have an unacceptable adverse impact on the consistent and cohesive character of Nos. 4-7 Langley Grove and could lead to a \"terracing effect\" between properties, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\r",
    "The scale and siting of the proposed first floor side extension would have an unacceptable overbearing impact upon No. 3 Langley Grove and it has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to the ground and first floor habitable rooms in the western elevation of No. 3 Langley Grove with regards to daylight and or sunlight. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of this neighbouring occupier, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
