    "By reason of its excessive depth, the proposed single storey rear extension would not appear subordinate or proportionate and would not relate well to the existing dwellinghouse, resulting in an incongruous addition, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "By reason of its excessive depth the proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of the neighbouring properties, particularly No. 335 Hook Rise South in terms of overbearing impact. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 335 Hook Rise South. Therefore, the proposed development would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\r"
