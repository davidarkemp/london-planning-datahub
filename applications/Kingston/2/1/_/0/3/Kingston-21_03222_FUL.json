    "The relocation of the cycle store to the rear communal amenity space would be less secure than the current arrangement, wherein the cycle store is integrated within the building and is accessed via the main entranceway, which could discourage residents from cycling as a mode of transport, contrary to Policy DM8 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021)."
