    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to cycle storage to enable Officers to properly assess the acceptability of the proposed storage, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to refuse/recycling facilities to serve the proposed development to adequately demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable waste storage facilities for both existing and future occupiers of the application building, contrary to Policy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012."
