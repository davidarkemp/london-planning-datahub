    "The proposal would result in a cramped and contrived form of development and have the appearance of being \"shoehorned\" into the site. It would be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed accommodation would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of built in storage space for a two storey 3-bed unit set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
