    "The tree was made subject to a TPO in 2011 and since that time has not put on any additional growth as evidenced by historic street view photos. The condition of the tree was clarified as being healthy and well shaped by conversation with the Tree Surgeon, confirming what can be seen in street view photos. As a mature specimen Silver Birch, unnecessary reduction work is not advisable for tree health and would likely push the tree into decline as is typical with the species. There is no justification for such works and as such the application should be refused."
