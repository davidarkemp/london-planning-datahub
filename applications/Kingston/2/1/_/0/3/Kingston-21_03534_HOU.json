    "By reason of its inadequate set in, set back and set down from the main roof ridge the proposed first floor side extension would not appear subordinate in relation to the original dwellinghouse and result in an excessive and incongruous addition. Due to its lack of set in from the shared boundary, the first floor side extension would also have an unacceptable impact on the character of the area, as it could lead to a \"terracing effect\" between properties. The proposed development would therefore be unacceptable in character and appearance terms and would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r"
