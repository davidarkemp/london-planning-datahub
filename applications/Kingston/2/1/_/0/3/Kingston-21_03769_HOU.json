    "By reason of its excessive depth and its siting along the shared boundary, in conjunction with the existing single storey extension, the proposed development would have an overbearing appearance on the neighbouring property at No. 56 King Henrys Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its depth, in conjunction with the existing single storey extension, the proposed development would appear an incongruous and excessive addition to an already extended property, and would therefore not respect the character and appearance of the original dwellinghouse, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
