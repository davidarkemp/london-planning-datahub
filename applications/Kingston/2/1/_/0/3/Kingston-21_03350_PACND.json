    "The proposed development would be an inelegant and bulky addition which would be incongruous in an area where development is largely at the two-storey level with consistent eaves, roof heights and building proportions. The resulting building would appear visually intrusive and incongruous and would not be sympathetic to local character or the surrounding built environment and would not add to the overall quality of the area contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Condition A.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of robust evidence, such as a Daylight & Sunlight Assessment, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of light to neighbouring premises, contrary to A.2(1)(g) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed flats would comply with the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015, contrary to 3(9A), 'Permitted Development', of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "In the absence of cogent evidence or assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that overspill car parking from the site would not adversely impact on-street car parking stress and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021).\r"
