    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would provide adequate private outdoor amenity space for the existing and future occupiers of the property. Also, due to the proposed extension's siting hard up against the shared boundary it would also result in an overbearing appearance in relation to the occupiers of No. 80 Southwood Drive, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (July 2013)."
