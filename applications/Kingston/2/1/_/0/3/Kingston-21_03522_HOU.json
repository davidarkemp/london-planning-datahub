    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, depth, siting and detailed design of the proposed two storey extension, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Oxford Crescent street scene resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, depth, siting and design, would not be proptionate to the host dwelling and would not reflect the established pattern of development in the surrounding area resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to the scale, depth, siting and design of the proposed developmnent, combined with the absence of information to demonstrate that the proposed extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring properties at Nos.6 and 10 Oxford Crescent through loss of outlook, daylight/sunlight and an undue sense of enclosure. contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Councils adopted Residential Design SPD 2013."
