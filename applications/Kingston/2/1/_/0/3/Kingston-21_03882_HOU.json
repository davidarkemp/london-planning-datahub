    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed height of the single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 45 Glebe Gardens. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its excessive height, in conjunction with its depth, the proposed single storey rear extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate in relation to the original dwelling. Furthermore, by reason of its excessive height, roof form and blank front elevation, the proposed single storey side extension would not be in keeping with the character of the existing dwelling and appear as an incongruous addition within the streetscene. The proposed development would therefore have an unacceptable impact in terms of character and appearance, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
