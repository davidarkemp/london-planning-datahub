    "The proposal would result in a cramped and overly dense form of development. It would also result in less than substantal harm to designated and non-designated heritage assets by disrupting the hierarchical plot arrangement on this site which is a characteristic feature of the Southborough Conservation Area, serve to undermine the prominence of No. 1 Corkran Road (a locally listed building) in its setting and be out of keeping with, and detract from, the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Paragraphs 130, 197, 203, 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The proposed development would fail to meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021. As such, the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012."
