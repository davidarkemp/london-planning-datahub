    "The proposed first floor rear extension and side dormer by virtue of their combined siting and scale, would create  incongruous and visually bulky additions to the host property that would detract from the visual amenity, character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding Conservation Area. In particular, when viewed from the neighbouring properties at Nos 4 and 6 St Leonards Square and St Leonards Square. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Due to the depth and siting of the proposed single storey rear extension, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring properties at Nos.4 and 6 St Leonards Square through loss of outlook, privacy and an undue sense of enclosure. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Councils adopted Residential Design SPD 2013."
