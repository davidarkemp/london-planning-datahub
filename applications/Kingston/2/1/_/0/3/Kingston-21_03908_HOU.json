    "The proposed single storey side extension of the proposed development, by virtue of it's incompatible roof form, combined depth, siting and lack of setback from the front elevation of the host building would represent an excessive addition that would not relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or that of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension element of the proposals would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to the nearest ground floor habitable room windows of No. 62 and No. 64A Compton Crescent and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook to those windows. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of this neighbouring occupier, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
