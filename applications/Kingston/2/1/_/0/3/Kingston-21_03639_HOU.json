    "The proposed development and in particular the two storey side extension and rear dormer, by reason of the scale, form, siting and design of the extensions, would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition to the dwelling, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed rear extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to the nearest ground and first floor habitable room windows of Nos. 151 and No. 155 Tudor Drive and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook to those windows. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of this neighbouring occupier, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
