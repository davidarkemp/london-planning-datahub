  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would result in material harm to the character and setting of the existing boundary wall to the front of the site (a curtilage listed wall). It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would fail to preserve the setting of the existing boundary wall to the front of the site and the Grade II Listed Church of St Matthew, resulting in less than substantial harm to these designated heritage assets. This harm would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to the objectives of Chapter 16 of the NPPF 2021, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rYou are advised to resubmit an application that includes a gate that preserves the significance of the curtilage listed wall. Please note a Listed Building Consent application would also be required."
