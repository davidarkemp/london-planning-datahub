    "Under the provisions of sections 206 and 213 of the Act, the owner of the land upon which the above tree(s) are to be removed is under a duty to plant one replacement tree of appropriate size and species, per tree under TPO removed according to the above list. These should be planted as close to the original tree(s) as possible unless otherwise agreed with the Council's Tree Officer. The replacement trees should be planted within the first planting season (Oct 1st - April 30th) following the proposed removals.\r\rThe size of the tree shall be a standard with a height of 2.50 metres, a minimum stem height of 1.75 metres and a girth of 8cm to 10cm to conform with BS 3936 Part 1 (1992).\r\rAny replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st to April 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\r\rAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\r\rEach of the following will be a suitable replacement for the tree to be removed as noted:\r\r(a) English Yew (Taxus baccata) as replacement for 0BNS.\r(b) Columnar Norway Maple (Acer platanoides 'Columnar') as replacement for 0BNJ.\r(c) Columnar Norway Maple (Acer platanoides 'Columnar') as replacement for 0BNE.\r(d) London Plane (Platanus x hispanica) as replacement for 0BN8.\r(e) Strawberry Tree (Arbutus unedo) as replacement for 0BN7.\r(f) Golden Alder (Alnus incana 'Aurea') as replacement for 0BN1.\r(g) Golden Alder (Alnus incana 'Aurea') as replacement for 0BMY.\r\rI have to warn you that if each of the above specified replacements are not planted by the end of the first planting season (Oct 1st 2022 to April 30th 2023) following the proposed removals, a notice may be served under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). However, I trust that such action will not be necessary and I look forward to receiving your full cooperation in this matter. Please ensure that you inform the Council's Tree Officer (ben.morgan@kingston.gov.uk) with the provision of a photo once the replanting has taken place."
