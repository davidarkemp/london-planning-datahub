    "The proposed single storey side rear extension of the proposed development, by virtue of it's combined depth, siting and lack of setback from the front elevation of the host building and incompatible roof form; and proposed scale of the rear extension would not represent a development that respects the existing pattern of development, and the built form of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\r"
