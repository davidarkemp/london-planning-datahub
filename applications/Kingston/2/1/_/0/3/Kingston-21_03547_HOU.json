    "By reason of siting, mass, design and height the proposed side extension would appear visually intrusive, incongruous, excessive in scale and dominant within the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension by reason of its siting and excessive bulk, scale and mass would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of  31 Isabella Place and 26 Latchmere Lane by reason of loss of sunlight and privacy. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed installation of a hoist would restrict access to the rear of the neighbouring properties at 24 & 26 Latchmere Lane during its use, compromising highway safety and would conflict with Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012)."
