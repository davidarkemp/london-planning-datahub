    "The proposed development would result in an incongruous and unbalanced roof form and the proposed materials for the rear dormer and single storey rear extension would not relate well to the host dwelling or the neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area, resulting in unacceptable harm interms of character and appearance. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of No. 13 & No. 17 Pine Gardens, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
