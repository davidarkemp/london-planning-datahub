    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter that would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset the Riverside South Conservation Area by failing to preserve or enhance its character and appearance with the benefits of the proposal not outweighing the disbenefits of the proposal (less than substantial harm to the conservation area). The proposal would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 194 - 209 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
