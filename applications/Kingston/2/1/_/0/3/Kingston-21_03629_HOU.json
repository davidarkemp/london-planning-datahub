    "By reason of its design and excessive scale, the proposed rear dormer roof extension would dominate the rear roofslope and would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed increase in height of the single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 31 Barnsbury Close. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
