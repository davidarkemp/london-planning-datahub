    "The proposal would result in a cramped and contrived form of development. It would also erode the spaciousness of this corner plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and as such detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed development would fail to meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021. As such, the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents, contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would be provided with inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposed dwelling would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation and outlook for future occupiers by virtue of the predominantly single-aspect and partially sunken layout of the dwelling. In addition, there is no technical Daylight and Sunlight Report to demonstrate adequate daylight and sunlight levels to the proposed dwellinghouse. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021."
