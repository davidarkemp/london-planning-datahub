    "By reason of its scale, form and design, the proposed hip to gable roof extension would clearly unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene. Furthermore the proposed rear dormer roof extension would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its scale, form and design, the proposed hip to gable roof extension would clearly unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses the application site forms part of and result in an incongruous appearance from the streetscape. The proposed rear dormer roof extension would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling which would also have an unacceptable appearance on the character and appearance of the area. In combination both aspects of the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC), conflicting with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012."
