    "By reason of its siting, mass and height the side extension would appear disproportionate to the original dwelling and would appear excessive in scale and dominant within the immediate streetscene. In addition, the proposed extension would not be set in from the boundary and could therefore lead to a terracing effect between properties. The proposal would have an unacceptable impact upon the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
