  "decision_conditions": [
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and consistent evidence or robust justification that the site is not suitable or that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the existing industrial land or a range of alternative employment uses. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS12 and DM 17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies E4 and E7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "Owing to the loss of the existing non-designated heritage asset, and the proposed replacement building which, by reason of the height, siting, scale, form, design and proportions of the second floor element would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and fail to preserve the significance of the Grade II Listed Building (Vine House), resulting in less than substantial harm to its setting. This harm is not considered to be outweighed by public benefits and the proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 199 - 203 of the NPPF, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8, DM 10 and DM 12 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of a number of habitable rooms to the ground floor flat and Flat 2 being subject to constrained levels of outlook and daylight and sunlight and the significant number of single aspect bedrooms, other secondary windows and amenity space directly facing the neighbouring Kwik Fit yard, the proposal is considered to result in a poor standard of accommodation, in conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "By reason of the site's location within a Locally Significant Industrial Site, the introduction of a number of single aspect and secondary habitable windows and amenity space directed towards the neighbouring commercial site and in the absence of information to demonstrate that the amenities of future occupiers of the development could be safeguarded without the need for future restrictions on the neighbouring site in relation to noise in particular, the application is considered to be in conflict with the 'agent of change' principles set out in paragraph 187 of the NPPF, policies D12 and E7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement precluding future occupiers from accessing parking permits in the CPZ, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that it can effectively mitigate the transport and highways impact of the development and avoid an unacceptable impact on highway safety or a severe impact on the local road network, in conflict with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policy T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), policies DM9 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Planning Obligations SPD (2017).",
    "In the absence of a flood risk assessment demonstrating that proposal satisfies the requirements set out in the NPPF (paragraphs 159-169) and that the flood risk to the site has been adequately addressed and managed to ensure that future users of the development will not be placed in danger from flood hazards throughout the lifetime of the development, the proposal is in conflict with Paragraphs 159 to 169 of the NPPF, Policy SI2 of the London Plan (2021) and DM4 of the Core Strategy (2012)."
