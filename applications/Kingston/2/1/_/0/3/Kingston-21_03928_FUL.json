    "The proposed development would result in the loss of a 3-bedroom+ property capable of occupation by a family for which there is an identified significant need within the Borough, contrary to Policy DM14 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal would constitute overdevelopment of the application site. The proposed design would not enhance the site, nor would it be of a sufficiently high design standard appropriate as a residential use. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of robust cogent information that the proposed development would not adversely impact on-street car parking stress which could adversely impact highway safety and residential amenity, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and Paragraph 110 of the NPPF 2021.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021."
