    "The proposed development would result in the loss of C2 housing and the applicant has provided no reasoned justification for its loss or supporting evidence that there is no longer a need for its provision. As such the proposal would be contrary to Policy H12 of the London Plan and Policy DM14 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create a dominant and overbearing incongruous feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties creating an unnecessary sense of enclosure to teh neighbouring properties and detract from the character and appearance of the host proeprty and the surrounding area. The proposal would not be in accordance with policy CS8 and DM10 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development would increase demand for on street parking and exacerbating existing on street car parking presures and the applicant has failed to provide any off street parking to mitigate this or evidence that there is capcity on street by way of a parking beat survey and as such the proposal is likely to prejudice highway safety. The proposal therefore would not accord Para 111 of the NPPF and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The application is not supported by a daylight/sunlight report and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact on the daylight/sunlight of adjacent neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of their existing living conditions. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
