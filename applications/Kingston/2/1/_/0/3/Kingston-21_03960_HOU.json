    "By reason of its design, materials, features, the proposed two-storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the dwellinghouse and the immediate streetscene. Furthermore, the proposed two-storey rear extension would not appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, dominating the rear elevation of the property. In addition, the proposed extension would not be set in from the boundary and would therefore lead to a terracing effect between properties. Additionally, the proposed alterations to the roof of the dwellinghouse would significantly impact the character of the Elm Road roofscape. The proposal would therefore have an unacceptable impact upon the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
