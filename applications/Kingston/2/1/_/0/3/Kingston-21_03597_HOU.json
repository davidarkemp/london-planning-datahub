    "By reason of its depth and its siting in relation to neighbouring property, No. 84 The Manor Drive the proposed development is considered to result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers in terms of overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure. It is also considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room windows of neighbouring properties, No. 84 and No. 88 The Manor Drive, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
