    "By reason of its insufficient set in from the boundary, lack of set down from the main roof ridge and lack of setback from the front elevation, the two storey side extension would appear disproportionate in relation to the original dwelling and would appear excessive in scale and dominant within the immediate streetscene. The proposal would therefore have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r"
