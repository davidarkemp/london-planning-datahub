    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development, specifically the proposed two-storey side extension, would not result in undue sense of overbearing and loss of outlook and daylight/sunlight to the windows of the neighbouring occupiers at No. 12. The proposals are therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
