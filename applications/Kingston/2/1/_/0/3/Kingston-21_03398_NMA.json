The development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the approved details, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period.\r\rThe CMP should include the following:\r\ra) Provision for loading/unloading materials;\rB) Storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles;\rc) Temporary site access;\rd) Signing system for works traffic;\re) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of\rother nuisance arising from development works;\rf) Location of all ancillary site buildings;\rg) Means of enclosure of the site; and\rh) Wheel washing equipment.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r\rCondition 10 (Drainage)\r\rPrior to any above ground works, the applicant must submit a final detailed drainage design strategy including drawings to the Lead Local Flood Authority for review and approval. The strategy should demonstrate that the London Plan drainage hierarchy has been applied, the site will achieve a maximum runoff rate no higher than the greenfield rate (including in the calculations the whole site area) as well as confirmation of the features and site's sustainable drainage system final layout. The strategy will need to include storage volume calculations, an annotated map of the exceedance routes, evidence calculations showing that there will be no onsite flooding and a detailed maintenance plan. The maintenance plan must confirm how and who will maintain each of the components of the proposed drainage scheme for the lifetime of the development.\r\rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems, the National Planning Policy Framework (Paragraph 103), the London Plan (Policies 5.12 and 5.13) along with associated guidance to these policies and DM4 of Kingston's Core Strategy.

The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the tree\rplanting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only.\r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
