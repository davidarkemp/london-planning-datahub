    "The proposed rear conservatory extension would not be of a high quality design, would not incorporate high quality materials and would have a contrived and discordant appearance within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area for which there would be no public benefit to outweigh the identified harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and the NPPF (2021)."
