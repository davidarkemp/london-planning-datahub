    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would preserve or enhance the Southbourough Conservation Area and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the surrounding area and would not result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor side extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to the ground floor habitable rooms in the eastern elevation of No. 51 Woodlands Road and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight and or sunlight and that the raised patio area would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the same neighbouring occupiers in terms of privacy and outlook. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.\r"
