    "Given that proposed piggyback roof extension would not be set back by 4m from the front elevation of the host property, the proposed development would appear an incongruous addition on the host property, and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
