    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed units would have an internal floor to ceiling height of 2.5 metres for at least 75% of the habitable floor space and as such would not comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM 13 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed rear extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would constitute an incongruous addition to the host property. They would not be a subordinate addition and would be of an excessive mass and bulk disproportionate to the existing built form of the application plot and would form a dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive feature in the private views of the site from neighbouring properties and would detract from the host property and the surrounding areas character and appearance. The proposal in this respect would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed development would exceed the maximum parking standards for a proposed development of this type in a PTAL area of 2 as set out in table 10.3 of Policy T6.1 of the London Plan. As such, the proposal would fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport by over providing parking provision, and would add to congestion on the highway.\r\rThe proposal is therefore the proposal would not accord with Policy T 6.1 of the London Plan 2021 or Policy DM9 of the RBK Core Strategy",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that he proposed parking layout would be able to operate effectively and would not prejudice highway safety and as such the proposal would not accord with policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r"
