    "The applicant has failed to provide an acoustic report or sufficient details of the extraction system in relation to the control of smells and odours. As such the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not cause harm to the residential amenity of the neighbouring occupiers by way of noise pollution, or odours and smells. As such the proposal would fail to accord with Policies D3 and D14 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed hot food take-away would be within 400 metres of St Joseph's RC School, Kingston Grammar School and Tiffin Boys School. As such the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) of the London Plan, 2021 that states development proposals containing A5 hot food takeaway uses should not be permitted where these are within 400 metres walking distance from the entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide adequate flood proofing and resilience techniques on site. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
