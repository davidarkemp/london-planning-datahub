    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance and in particular its height would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with but detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed telecoms equipment would be sited in an area proposed for a future pocket park and the proposal would be prejudicial to the proposals for the pocket park being brought forward. It is considered that the siting and appearance would be inappropriate in this case and it would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
