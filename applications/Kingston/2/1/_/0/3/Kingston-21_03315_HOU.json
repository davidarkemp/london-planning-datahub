    "The excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension along the shared boundary would have an overbearing impact on the occupiers of the adjoining dwelling and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight. The proposed development would therefore result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of No. 52 High Drive, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
