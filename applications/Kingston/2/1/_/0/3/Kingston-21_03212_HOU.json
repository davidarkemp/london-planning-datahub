    "The proposed development, by reason of its combined depth and siting hard up against the shared boundary would result in an overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure to the occupants of neighbouring property, No. 143 Glebe Gardens. Furthermore, the applicant has not provided cogent evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of light to this neighbouring property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
