    "By reason of its height, scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, exacerbated by the increased patio height, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 123 Somerset Avenue, by reason of a loss of daylight, unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no. 123 Somerset Avenue. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
