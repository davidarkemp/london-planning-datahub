    "As the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development at first and second floor level would not unduly compromise residential amenity  in relation to the closest habitable windows at No. 90 and 92 Mount Pleasant Road at ground and first floor level, officers consider that the proposed development would unduly compromise the amenities of No. 90 and 92 Mount Pleasant Road, by reason of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of design and form, the proposed two storey side extension would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
