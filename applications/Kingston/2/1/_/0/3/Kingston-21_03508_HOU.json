    "By reason of its excessive depth along the shared boundary the proposed single storey rear extension would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of No. 115 Cardinal Avenue in terms of overbearing impact.  The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed single storey rear extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 115 Cardinal Avenue. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
