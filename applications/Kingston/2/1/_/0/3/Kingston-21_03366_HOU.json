    "By reason of its design, mass, and scale the proposed rear extension would appear disproportionate to the original dwelling and would appear excessive in scale and dominant thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The excessive depth of the proposed ground floor rear extension, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 99 Cambridge Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 99 Cambridge Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r"
