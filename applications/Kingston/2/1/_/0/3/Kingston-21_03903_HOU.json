  "decision_conditions": [
    "Given the scale and siting of the proposed two storey side extensions and the excessive scale of the proposed window at first floor level on the front elevation, officers consider the proposed development would unduly compromise the amenities of No. 43 and 26 Burghley Avenue, and No. 24 Neville Avenue, by reason of loss of light/sunlight, overbearing appearance and loss of privacy. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to the use of uncharacteristic materials used on the front elevation, lack of separation distance between the proposed two storey side extensions and shared boundaries, and the scale of the rear and front extension, including the extensive use of glazing the proposal would largely detract from the character and appearance of the existing dwelling. The excessive nature of the proposed development would also erode the characteristic gaps between the dwelling houses on Burghley Avenue and result in a cramped appearance within the streetscape and be incongruous and wholly out of character in relation to the properties in the immediate surrounding area, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
