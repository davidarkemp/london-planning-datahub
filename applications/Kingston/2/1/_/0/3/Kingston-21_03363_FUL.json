    "The applicant has failed to robustly demonstrate that the site is unsuitable, or that it would be unviable, to provide an appropriate mix of units to contribute towards the Borough's objectively assessed need for 93% of dwellings to be 2 or more bedrooms in size.  The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses. The net loss of employment capacity within Surbiton District Centre (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy E1 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Flat 2 would be substandard in size and neither Flat 1 or Flat 2 would have access to private or communal amenity space. The proposed internal water usage would far exceed the maximum levels set out in the London Plan (2021) and would fail to incorporate water conservation and efficient water use. The development is therefore contrary to Policies D6 and SI5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM10, DM13 and DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "No mechanism has been submitted to secure the proposed development as 'car free' and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed flats would have any dedicated secure on-site cycle parking. The proposal fails to to encourage sustainable modes of travel and that the development would not increase congestion and on-street car parking stress which could adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would result in direct overlooking between proposed Flat 2 and a neighbouring flat. No details of a dedicated refuse and recycling store have been submitted, the absence of which, could result in the inconsiderate disposal or storage of waste and recycling materials in the vicinity of neighbours, or on the street which would harm neighbouring amenity and the character of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
