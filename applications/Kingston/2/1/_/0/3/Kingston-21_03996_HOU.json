    "The proposed rear outbuilding would be dominant and disproportionate in relation to the size of the host dwelling and plot size and would result in an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "As a result of the proposed development the remaining level of private outdoor amenity space would fall below the standards required for a family sized dwelling and therefore is considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the standard of accommodation provided on site, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
