    "The site falls within the Seething Wells Filter Beds Grade 1 Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) and is highlighted as a site that is frequented by wintering wildfowl and other birds seeking refuge from the comparatively exposed river. The site lies next to the banks of the Thames, a SINC of Metropolitan importance, and is highlighted as being of particular importance for wildfowl and wading birds. The Bushy Park and Home Park SSSI less than100 metres away on the other side of the river. Taken together this demonstrates that the site is in a highly ecological sensitive area\r\rProtected and priority species such as daubenton's bat, mute swan, kingfisher and grass snake have been recorded on site, and the erection of a fence surrounding the open standing water will likely impede flight lines of avian and chiroptera (bat) species.\r\rThe application submission has failed to provide an appropriately detailed assessment of the ecological baseline of the site, has failed to provide a full assessment of any potential harmful impact of the proposal on the biodiversity interests of the site, and has failed to appropriately demonstrate that, in line with the mitigation hierarchy, any harm could be avoided or that mitigation could be employed to address any harm.\r\rAbsent any cogent evidence to the contrary it is considered that the design and location of the proposed fencing is likely to have a significant impact on the biodiversity interests of the site.\r\rAs such, the development is in conflict with paragraph 180 of the National Planning Policy Framework; Policies CS3 (The Natural and Green Environment) and DM6 (Biodiversity) of the LDF Core Strategy (2012); and  Policy G6 (Biodiversity and access to nature) of the London Plan 2021.\r"
