    "The removal of condition 4 of planning permission 21/01974/HOU would conflict with the purposes of its imposition which is to protect the privacy of the neighbouring occupiers and the LPA is not satisfied with the details provided that its removal would not result in the actual or perceived loss of privacy to the neighbouring occupiers and the proposal therefore would not be in accordance with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe applicant is reminded that if they wish to insert a window after they have completed the development previously approved they would be able to submit a standalone planning application. The impact of the standalone application would be assessed on its own merits."
