    "Due to its excessive height and depth along the shared boundary the proposed rear extension would fail the 45 degree rule on both plan and elevation view in relation to No. 39 Douglas Road, in conflict with BRE Guidance, resulting in an unacceptable loss of light, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013.",
    "The proposed rear extension is considered not to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.3 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended) as the proposed extension would not use materials of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse."
