The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its siting, combined with the raised ground level and low boundary treatment, the proposed window on the side elevation facing No. 23 Burney Road would have an unacceptable impact on the privacy of this neighbouring property through overlooking. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
