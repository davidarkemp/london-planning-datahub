    "The proposed development by reason of its design, bulk, and massing would detract from the appearance of the building and would be out of character and unduly prominent within the streetscene, and represent a discordant and incongruous feature which would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The resulting building would appear visually intrusive and incongruous and would not be sympathetic to local character or the surrounding built environment, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Condition AB.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AB of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of, and visitors to, the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development could lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012 and Condition AB.2(1)(a) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AB of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
