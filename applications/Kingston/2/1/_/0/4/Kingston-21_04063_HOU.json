    "The proposed first floor side extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and that of the surrounding area and be visually intrusive in the streetscene. It would also erode the characteristic gaps between properties on Cedarcroft Road, which could lead to a terracing effect. The proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
