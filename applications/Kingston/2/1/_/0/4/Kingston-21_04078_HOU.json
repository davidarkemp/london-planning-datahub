    "The proposed development is inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on openness due to the increased spread of built form across the site and the increased height and prominence of the materially larger replacement Pool House building. No Very Special Circumstances exist which would clearly outweigh the identified harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM5 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012),  Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).",
    "Insufficient ecological assessments have been submitted to allow Officers to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on Bats and to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm bats and their habitat, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021)."
