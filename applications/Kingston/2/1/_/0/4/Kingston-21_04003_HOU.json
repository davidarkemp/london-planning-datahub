    "By reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No. 10 Coombe House Chase, excessive bulk, scale, mass and unsympathetic roof form the proposed first floor side and two storey rear extensions are considered to be of a poor design and would not only result in an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling, but would also erode the characteristic gaps between properties on Coombe House Chase, which could lead to a terracing effect. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No. 10 Coombe House Chase, excessive bulk, scale, mass and unsympathetic roof form the proposed first floor side and two storey rear extensions are considered to be of a poor design and would not only result in an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling, but would also erode the characteristic gaps between properties on Coombe House Chase, which could lead to a terracing effect. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area and result in less than substantial harm to the significance and setting of the Coombe House Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of  Special Character which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraphs 202 and 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy Paragraph HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor side and two storey rear extension would comply with BRE Guidance and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook from the nearest habitable room windows of No.10 Coombe House Chase. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
