    "Due to its design, bulk, scale and mass the proposed first floor rear extension with raised ridge roof right would appear excessive in scale and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development at first and second floor level would not result in an unacceptable overbearing impact and loss of light to the closest habitable room windows at No. 67 and No. 71 Kings Road at first floor level. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
