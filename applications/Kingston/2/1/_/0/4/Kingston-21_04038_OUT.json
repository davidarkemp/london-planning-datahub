  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed dwellinghouse would be of a size, siting and design that would create and incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be a dominant, overbearing, visually intrusive feature and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Straegy Apil 2012.",
    "The application in part seeks to determine the access to the application site. However the applicant has failed to provide any details of any access to the site and as such officers are unable to determine whether the access to the application site would be acceptable in terms of location and highway safety and as such the proposal would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that at least 75% of the floorplate of the proposed dwellinghouse would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m and that the minimum gross internal floorpspace threshold would be met and as such would not accord with policy D6 of the London Plan and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide details of private amenity space and it is unclear as to whether or not the proposal would have adequate provision of private amenity space and and as such the proposal would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Counci's adopted Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in close proximity to the boundary of the donor site 2 Burford Road and the rear gardens of Idmiston Square would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure and reduce the openess of the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of their existing living conditions and as such the proposal would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
