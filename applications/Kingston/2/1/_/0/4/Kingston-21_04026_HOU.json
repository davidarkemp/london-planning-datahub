    "The proposed pergola by virtue of its siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and that of the immediate surrounding area, resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal would conflict with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area. The proposal would conflict with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
