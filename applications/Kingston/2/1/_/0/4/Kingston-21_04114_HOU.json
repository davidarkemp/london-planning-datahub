    "Due to its bulk, scale, and design the proposed first floor extension would appear as an overly dominant and incongruous addition to the host property which would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor extensions would not unduly compromise residential amenity in relation to the closest habitable windows at No. 60 Southwood Drive at ground floor level, resulting in an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing impact. The proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
