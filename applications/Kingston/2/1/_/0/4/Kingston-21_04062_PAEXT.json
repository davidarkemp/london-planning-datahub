    "The proposed extension does not fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.4 (7) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of light to the nearest ground floor habitable room windows at both neighbouring properties, No. 63 and No. 67 Hunters Road, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012. Furthermore, it would fail the 45 degree rule on both plan and elevation, conflicting with BRE Guidance."
