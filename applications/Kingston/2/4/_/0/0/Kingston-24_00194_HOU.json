    "The proposed roof alterations, rooflights and other identified design features of the proposal, by reason of their siting, scale, form, height and design would appear as incongruous additions to the existing dwelling and would appear visually dominant in the streetscene resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm to its significance for which there would be no public benefit which would outweigh the identified harm. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Section 72 of Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended).\r\r"
