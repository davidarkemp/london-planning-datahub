    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed accommodation would have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.3m for at least 75% of the total floor area, contrary to the requirements of the Nationally Described Space Standards (2015). The development therefore conflicts with Paragraph (9A) of 3, Permitted Development, Interpretation of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "The application building is located within the Oakhill Conservation Area and is a locally listed building. It is considered that the proposed change of use would erode the contribution which the application building makes to the wider terrace of commercial properties which, in turn, provide a group historic illustrative value to the significance of the Oakhill Conservation Area. The proposal would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. Prior approval is therefore required and refused under Condition MA.2(2)(e) of Class MA of Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application proposed operational development (the demolition and erection of a replacement single storey rear extension) for which there is no provision under Class MA of Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It is indicated within the submission that hardstanding to the front of the property could be used for vehicular parking, however, there is no vehicular crossover to provide access and the use of this area for car parking would pose a safety risk to pedestrians and cyclists as well as other highway users. Furthermore, no Unilateral Undertaking has been submitted to preclude occupants of the proposed accommodation from applying for on-street car parking permits such that the proposals could exacerbate on-street car parking stress which in turn could lead to inconsiderate and illegal car parking which would impact highway safety. Prior approval is therefore required and refused under Condition MA.2(2)(a) of Class MA of Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended). \r"
