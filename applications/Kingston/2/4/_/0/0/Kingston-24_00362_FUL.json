    "The proposed unit would not have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5 m for at least 75% of the proposed habitable floorspace and this would result in a substandard level of accommodation and as such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The position of the unit in relation to its neighbouring properties and orientation is such that the future occupants may not have adequate provision of daylight sunlight and in the absence of a daylight/sunlight study officers considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that this would not be the case and as such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed unit by virtue of its siting and proximity to Coppergate Mews and Irongate Mews to the rear of the site is likely to give rise to noise and disturbance and overlooking of residential properties and mutual overlooking between the properties which would result in a loss of privacy for future occupants of the development proposed and existing occupants to the rear of the site resulting in an adverse impact on the existing and future living conditions of neighbouring occupiers and future occupants of the proposed unit As such the proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
