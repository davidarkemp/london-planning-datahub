    "The proposed first floor side and rear extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design and proximity to the side boundary would create an incongruous addition that would erode the spaciousness of the plot to the side and erode the gap in the built form between the adjacent property 160 Tolworth Rise South detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "Due to its excessive depth of the first floor rear element along the shared boundary, the proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and overbearing impact to No. 164 Tolworth Rise South, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
