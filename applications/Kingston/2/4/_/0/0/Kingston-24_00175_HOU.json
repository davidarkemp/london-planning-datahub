    "The proposed mansard roof form is not considered to be characteristic to the surrounding area. Considering design, siting and  mass and bulk of the proposal, it would appear as an incongruous addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area.  As such, the proposed development is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the street scene, contrary to Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
