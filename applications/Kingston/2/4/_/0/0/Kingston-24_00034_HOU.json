    "The proposed mansard roof extension with dormer roof extensions to front and  rear would by virtue of size and design form an incongruous feature  at the  application dwelling that would be out of character with the host property and surrounding properties in the local area.  As such, the proposed development is considered to be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the streetscene, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 221, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
