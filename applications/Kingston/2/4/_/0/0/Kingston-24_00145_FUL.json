    "The proposed units would not meet the minimum internal floorspace standards for a studio with shower and 2 bed 2 story 4 person unit as required by table 3.1 of policy D6 of the London Plan and this would result in a substandard level of accommodation and as such the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The the applicant has failed to clearly demonstrate the proposed units would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5 m for at least 75% of the proposed habitable floorspace and this would result in a substandard level of accommodation and as such the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposal does not provide sufficient levels of cycle parking to meet the minimum 3 spaces required by table 10.2 of the London Plan for a development of this type in a PTAL 2 rated location in outer London. The proposal would not accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM8 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
