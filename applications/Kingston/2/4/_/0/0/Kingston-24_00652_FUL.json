    "Notwithstanding the detail submitted the applicant has not demonstrated that the unit would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5 m for at least 75% of the proposed habitable floorspace and as such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposed accommodation would be of a cramped and impractical layout and the bedroom proposed would have limited outlook and the proposed rooflights being the only windows serving the bedroom would likely be overlooked by the existing units surrounding the application site which would result in a loss of privacy for future occupants. As such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed orientation of the unit and surrounding built form is such that the proposed unit would likely not have an inadequate provision of daylight/sunlight and the applicant has not provided any supporting evidence that the proposed unit would have adequate daylight/sunlight provision. As such it is considered that the proposal would provide a substandard form of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed layout would be likely to lead to conflict between the commercial and residential use which could give rise to adverse impacts on the amenity of future residential occupiers or compromise the existing or future viability of the commercial use. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy D13 of the London Plan.",
    "The proposal would result in the displacement of a number of existing plant equipment associated with the ground floor commercial use and the applicant has not demonstrated how this would be re-provided and the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed residential unit would not conflict with the existing commercial use and not prejudice the commercial units' continued long term viability. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy D13 of the London Plan. \r",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting and design would create an incoherent and piecemeal design giving a sense of a cramped form of development that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would be contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan and CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
