    "The proposed principal habitable living space the kitchen/living room in unit two has a deep floor plate and limited fenestration and likely would not receive adequate levels of daylight/sunlight for future occupants and the applicant has not provided any evidence to demonstrate this would not be the case. As such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The units' access arrangements across land on the adjacent property are likely to give rise to noise and disturbance and a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers and the future occupants of the proposed development and add to the substandard nature of the proposed accommodation. As such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023 Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
