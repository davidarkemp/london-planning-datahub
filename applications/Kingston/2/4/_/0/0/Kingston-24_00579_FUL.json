As such the proposal would provide a substandard level of accommodation and conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS10 and DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed alterations by virtue of their size, siting and design would be an incongruous addition to and would not be sympathetic to the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would be in conflict with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 andPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal would result in the net loss of residential floorpsace and as such the proposal would be in conflict with policy DM14 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed first floor recess and 2nd floor balcony screen would create an unnacceptable sense of enclosure to neighbouring occupiers and future occupiers of the proposed development to the detriment of existing and future living conditions of neighbouring occupiers and future occupants of the proposed units. As such the proposal would be in conflict with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 andPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposal does not demonstrate that there would be provision of cycle parking for the future occupants of the proposed units. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would comply with the fire safety requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021. \r",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network. As such, in the absence of any mitigation for the demand for on street parking being in place, the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
