    "Insufficient and imprecise information has been submitted to demonstrate that, on the balance of probability, the proposed external insulation would not materially affect the external appearance of the dwellinghouse. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed works would comprise works as described under Section 55 (2) (a) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) ( as amended) and as such the proposed external insulation is considered to comprise development which would require planning permission ."
