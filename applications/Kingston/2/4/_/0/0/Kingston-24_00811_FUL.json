    "The proposal would result in the loss of employment land and premises and the applicant has failed to demonstrate by sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. As such the proposal would not accord with policy DM17 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed unit would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5 m for at least 75% of the proposed habitable floorspace as required by Policy D6 of the London Plan or demonstrated that the proposed private amenity space and refuse/recycling store would be fit for purpose or future occupants would have sufficient provision of daylight sunlight or not be overlooked by neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the LDF Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient cycle parking for the proposal and as such the proposal would not accord with London Plan Policy T5.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would comply fully with the fire safety requirements of  Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021 as it is required to provide detail as to how the proposal would comply with the said criteria for criteria 1 - 6 of the Policy."
