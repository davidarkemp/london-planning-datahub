    "The applicant makes clear that the damage is limited to the 1990's brick built conservatory on the rear elevation. DespiteÂ this structure likely being built under Permitted Development, it was legally required to be built in accordance with the Building regulations and should have been subject to a Building Control application for sign off or have been signed off on the same basis by an approved inspector. The Council Building Control Dept have confirmed that they hold no records showing either of these to have occurred and that the structure could not have passed and received sign off in any event given that it is not built in accordance with the regs and fails the requisite standards in several respects. The Building regs require that the foundation for this building should be a specially engineered solution due to being on London Clay in close proximity (4.3m) to a high water demand tree, but the excavation data provided by the applicant establishes that the conservatory is built upon a standard strip foundation at a maximum depth of 1.75m which is grossly insufficient to prevent subsidence from occurring. \r\rThe application is therefore refused on the basis that the damage is limited to the Conservatory which has not been built in accordance with the Building Regulations. But for the defective foundations of the conservatory the damage would not have been caused or associated losses incurred and the responsibility therefore lies with the owner. On the same basis the Council are not therefore open to a claim for compensation due to the \"loss or damage being reasonably foreseeable by that person (the applicant) and attributable to that person's failure to take reasonable steps to avert the loss or damage or to mitigate its extent\" (Regulation 24(4)(c) of the 2012 Regulations). Furthermore, the damage/loss has already occurred and is not therefore as a consequence of this refusal."
