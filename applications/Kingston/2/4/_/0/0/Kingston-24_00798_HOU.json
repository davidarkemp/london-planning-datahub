    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with Arboricultural Method Statement 14.03.2024, Arboricultural Survey to BS5837:2012 30.01.2024, ARBTECH AIA 01 Arboricultural Impact Assessment and ARBTECH TPP 01 Tree Protection Plan. The approved measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '18 Motspur Park New Malden KT3 6PL', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 01.04.2024, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
