    "The proposed rear dormer extension by virtue of its design, mass and bulk would not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property in terms of use of materials thereby creating an incongruous  addition to the host property.  It would be a highly prominent addition when viewed from neighbouring properties and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area causing harm to the character and appearance. The proposed development  is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021),  Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD ( 2013) ."
