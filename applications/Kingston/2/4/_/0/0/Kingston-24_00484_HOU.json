    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale and siting, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling and would unduly erode the gap to no 47 Compton Crescent resulting in an unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 20212 and the Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "By reason of its siting and combined height and depth along the boundary, the proposed development is considered to have an overbearing impact to the neighbouring property at no 51 Compston Crescent and it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would have a significant impact on daylight to No 51 Compton Crescent. . The proposal is thereby contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CSS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design SPD 2013."
