    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would be an incongruous addition to the host property that would be a dominant and visually intrusive feature in the street scene and would serve to reduce the openness of the host property's frontage and would be out of keeping with the general open frontage of the surrounding properties and as such would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would not accord with polices CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
