    "Due to the excessive width and lack of set in from the site boundary, the proposed side extension would appear as overly dominant and a highly disproportionate addition and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its height and depth along the shared boundary with No.143 Pembury Avenue would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to the closest ground floor habitable room window at 143 Pembury Avenue and would be overbearing and result in an undue sense of enclosure.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
