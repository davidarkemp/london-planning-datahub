    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the designated heritage assets by reason of  the inappropriate layout, scale and appearance of development, which  would adversely impact the appreciation of the significance of 4 and 5-6 Oaklea Passage. This is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is contrary to Section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 205 and 208 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2023.",
    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate that the replacement parking provision for existing neighbouring residents could be safely and conveniently accessed, as evidenced in the autocad vehicle tracking drawings (swept path analysis), which the applicant has provided in their Transport Technical Note.  The proposal also fails to make adequate  provision for  the collection of refuse and recycling, and has not demonstrated how the fire truck will exit the development in forward gear. As such the proposed development would result in highway safety concerns and an increase in on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets. As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 115 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2023; Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021; Policies CS7, CS9, DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy; and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.\r",
    "The submitted Fire Strategy fails to identify the required turning facilities for the fire tender in this dead-end access route, and has therefore failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would provide for adequate  levels of fire safety for neighbouring properties along Oaklea Passage contrary to Policies D11 and D12(A) of the London Plan 2021.\r\r\r"
