    "Due to its mass and siting, the proposed development would be disproportionate and would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough  Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of robust evidence that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the protected trees which contribute towards the character and appearance of Southborough Conservation Area. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area, contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the existing off street car parking spaces. Given the scale and siting of the proposal and the size of the existing front garden it is likely that the new car parking arrangement would not meet the car parking standards, resulting in inconsiderate car parking which could impact on the highway safety, contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
