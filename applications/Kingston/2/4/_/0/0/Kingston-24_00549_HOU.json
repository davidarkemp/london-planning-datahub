    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed roof extensions and provision of a balcony that is not characteristic to the area, would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such it is considered that the these elements of the proposal would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Due to the siting of the balcony it is considered that it would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of adjoining properties in terms of overlooking and loss of privacy, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013)."
