    "The excessive width of the proposed extension coupled with the proximity to the site boundaries would create an incongruous addition that would erode the spaciousness of the plot to the side and open green character of the area resulting in harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Residential Design SPD 2013."
