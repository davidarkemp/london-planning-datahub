    "The deposited plans in support of the details application show changes to the approved front boundary treatment under planning permission 21/01585/FUL and the plans as such would conflict with the plans approved under planning permission 21/01585/FUL.",
    "The applicant has not provided sufficient detail to determine whether the proposed waste and recycling details would satisfy the requirements of Condition 14 of the planning permission which is to ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proliferation of cycle lockers proposed across the site would create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Oakhill Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset. The proposal would not accord with paragraphs 195 - 214 of the NPPF 2021,  policies CS6, CS8, DM8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed cycle parking is insufficient as it provides fewer cycle parking spaces than the required 11 residents and 2 visitors cycle parking spaces required by policy T5 of the London Plan and therefore the proposed development would not accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021."
