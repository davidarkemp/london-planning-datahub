The proposed amendments cannot be sought via Section 73A of The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended)\r",
    "Notwithstanding the first reason for refusal, the subdivision of the plot would result in the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development as a whole would result in an unacceptable urbanising effect and would appear incongruous when viewed from neighbouring properties, causing harm to the character and appearance of the existing site and wider area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023).",
