    "2.\tUnder the provisions of Section 206/213 of the Act, the owner of the land upon which the above tree(s) are to be removed, is under a duty to plant one replacement tree of appropriate size and specie, per tree under TPO removed according to the above list. These should be planted as close to the original tree(s) as possible and agreed with the Council Tree Officer prior to planting at development.management@kingston.gov.uk. The replacement trees should be planted within the first planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) following the proposed removals.\r\r3.\tThe size of the tree shall be a standard with a height of 2.50 metres, a minimum stem height of 1.75 metres and a girth of 8-10cms to conform with BS: 3936 Part1 (1992).\r\r4.\tAny replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased, shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\r\rAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\r\rI have to warn you that if suitable replacements are not planted by the end of the first planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) following the proposed removals, this matter will be referred to the appropriate committee and authority sought for the service of a notice under section 207 of the Town & Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended). However, I trust that such action will not be necessary and I look forward to receiving your full co-operation in this matter.  Please ensure that you inform the Tree Officer at development.management@kingston.gov.uk once the replanting has taken place.\r\rIn the instance that your application includes any works to Oak trees, you must notify the Forestry Commission prior to commencing.  Notification should be made to the following e-mail address or telephone number and should include address and contact details:\r\rE-mail: andrew.hoppit@forestry.gsi.gov.uk\rDirect Line: 07884 234725 \r\rThis will allow the Forestry Commission to ascertain the potential for infection by Oak Processionary Moth based upon up to date survey information and provide guidance accordingly.\r"
