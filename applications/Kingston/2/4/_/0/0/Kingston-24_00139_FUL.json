    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed solar panels would not be visible within the streetscene so officers have been unable to confirm that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. The construction of the single storey rear extension and associated infrastructure along/over the site boundary and alterations to the first floor window would result in the development appearing visually dominant when viewed from neighbouring properties, harming the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed works could be achieved within the red line boundary of the site and the first floor bay window would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy to neighbouring gardens. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
