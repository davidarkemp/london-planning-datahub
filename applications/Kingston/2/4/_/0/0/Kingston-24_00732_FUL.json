    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the installation of the proposed extraction system, full details of the proposed extraction system shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The submission shall include, where applicable, details of:\r\r(i) The extract fan, attenuators (it is recommended that the infill is protected by Melinex polyester film), anti-vibration mounts, high velocity cowl, filters, odour abatement and any other items of plant;\r\r(ii) The velocity of the air at final discharge and duct termination height and location\r\r(iii) The retention time of gases in the carbon filters (where applicable);\r\r(iv) A maintenance schedule;\r\r(v) A completion of an risk assessment of odour and demonstration of compliance with \"Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems\" published by EMAQ+ dated September 2018, which replaced the previous Defra guidance, now withdrawn.\r\rThe approved extraction system shall be installed on site in accordance with the approved details and shall be retained and maintained thereafter. Any variations thereafter shall be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rNotwithstanding the information on the approved drawings a cowl which permits undisturbed vertical flow of the exhaust gases must be used in the final design and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The rating level of the noise from the kitchen extract system hereby permitted shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level during any normal mode of operation.  The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window of a habitable room at the nearest residential facade.  Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
