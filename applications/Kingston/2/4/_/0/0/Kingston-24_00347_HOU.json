    "Due to its siting and by virtue of its increased height, excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed roof extension would constitute a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling resulting in an unacceptable impact on the existing street scene and the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character contrary to Policies DM10, DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012), D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021).\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at the first floor level in the side elevation at the first floor flat at No 195 Park Road and the habitable openings at No 199. Given the increased eaves height and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the BRE \"25 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring windows, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupants of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r"
