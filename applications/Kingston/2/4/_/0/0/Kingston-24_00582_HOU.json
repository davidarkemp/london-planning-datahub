    "The proposed development comprises disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original dwellinghouse and is inappropriate development in the Metropolitan Open Land Area and would have a detrimental impact on its open character. No Very Special Circumstances exist which would clearly outweigh the identified harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM5 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012),  Policies G2 and G3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass and lack of adequate separation distances, the proposed extensions would cumulatively constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition to the host dwelling resulting in an adverse impact on the open character of the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
