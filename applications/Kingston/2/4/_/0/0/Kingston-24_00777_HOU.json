    "The proposed alterations due to the proposed design and the proposed materials  would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Park Road Conservation Area, which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
