    "Due to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans officers are unable to appropriately assess the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the property or the wider area. Therefore, it is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development, in conflict with the Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of height and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No.13 Beech Grove by reason of overbearing appearance and would lead to an unacceptable loss of daylight and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
