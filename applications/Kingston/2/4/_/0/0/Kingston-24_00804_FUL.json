    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate by way of any detailed assessments of the need for supported and specialised accommodation or provided a detailed audit of existing accommodation options available within the Kingston borough identifying any shortages in capacity or potential extra capacity within schemes, as well as accommodation in need of refurbishment. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy H12 of the London Plan. \r",
    "The proposed accommodation by virtue of its size and design would be of an impractical layout, deficient in floorspace, outlook and amenity space and would fail to accord with Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposed habitable room windows would be in very close proximity to site boundaries such that it is unclear whether the units would receive sufficient daylight. In the absence of information to the contrary the applicant has failed to demonstrate that future occupants of the proposed units would have adequate provision of daylight/sunlight and as such the proposal would fail to accord with Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would have the appearance of being shoe-horned into the site creating an incongruous addition to surrounding area that would be a dominant, overbearing visually intrusive feature in the streetscene and erode the spaciousness and visual relief between the built form of St James Road and Maple Road and compete with and detract from the setting of the Statutorily Listed St Andrews Church when viewed from St James Road and fail to preserve or enhance and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the St Andrews Square Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage assets. As such the proposal would not accord with paragraphs 195 - 214 of the NPPF, Policy HC1 and D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012\r",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would compromise the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers at the rear of properties in Maple Road and front of St James Road opposite creating a dominant and overbearing feature and unnecessary sense of enclosure that would diminish and be to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012\r",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking or reprovision of existing parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
