    "The proposed development would result in the removal of a protected Yew Tree ('T9') which is of a good quality, which contributes positively to the character of the area and has high amenity value. The removal of the Yew tree would harm the character and appearance of the Oakhill Local Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset and the wider area contrary to Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021).\r\r",
    "Insufficient robust evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed basement would be suitably flood resistant and resilient such that it would not pose a safety risk to occupants in a flood event, contrary to Policy D11(C) of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 173b of the NPPF (2021).\r\r",
    "Following the proposed removal of the protected Yew Tree, there would be an unacceptable loss of privacy to the rear private amenity space of neighbouring No. 4 Walpole Road from the proposed bedroom window contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021)."
