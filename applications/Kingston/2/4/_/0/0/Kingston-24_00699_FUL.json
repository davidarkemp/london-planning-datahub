It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposal and therefore the proposal would be contrary to policies DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would provide the adequate quantum or quality of usable private amenity space for the future occupiers of the development. The proposed dwelling would be sited close to a railway line and the relevant technical reports have not been submitted to demonstrate whether the proposal would mitigate any adverse noise/vibration impacts arising from the use of the railway line. It has not been adequately demonstrated that the proposal would represent good quality accommodation. The proposal would be contrary to policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance. The proposal would be contrary to policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012",
    "It has not been adequately demonstrated that the proposed off-street parking space would not compromise highway safety and that the parking space would not obstruct access to the rear for neighbouring residents. The proposal would be contrary to policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development would be a self-build home. Were it to be demonstrated the home would be self-build, no means of securing it as such has been submitted. As such, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would be exempt from Biodiversity Net Gain, contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
