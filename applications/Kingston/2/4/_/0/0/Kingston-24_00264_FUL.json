    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would reduce the openness of the site at the rear which is currently of a relatively open nature and would create an incongruous feature that would cause visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property a local listed building and fail to preserve or enhance the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. As such the proposal would not accord with paragraphs 195 to 214 of the NPPF 2023 and Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy, 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the level of illumination and light spill from the new lighting would not result in harmful levels of light pollution that could have a detrimental impact on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. As such the proposal would not accord with policy CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
