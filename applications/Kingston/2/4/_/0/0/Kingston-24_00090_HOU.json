    "The proposed first floor front extension due to its flat roof design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and be visually intrusive in the streetscene and as a result detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF's adopted Cpre Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD 2013."
