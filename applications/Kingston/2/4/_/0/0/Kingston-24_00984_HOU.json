    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '297 Hook Rise South Chessington KT6 7LS', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 18.04.2024, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Statement hereby approved and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of Fire Safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r"
