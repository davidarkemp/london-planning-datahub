    "The proposed units would not meet the minimum internal floorspace standards for a studio with shower as required by table 3.1 of policy D6 of the London Plan and this would result in a substandard level of accommodation and as such the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The the applicant has failed to clearly demonstrate the proposed units would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5 m for at least 75% of the proposed habitable floorspace and this would result in a substandard level of accommodation and as such the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021",
    "The proposed alterations would not be architecturally sympathetic to the host property or the surrounding properties. The proposal would erode all architectural detailing on the building creating a bland and unarticulated exterior and would create an incongruous addition to the streetscene and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and cause less than substantial harm to the non designated heritage asset the Berrylands Road Local Area of Special Character. As such the proposal would not accord with paragraphs 195 - 214 of the NPPF and polices D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate by way of a daylight/sunlight study that future occupants would receive adequate daylight sunlight provision so as not to have a detriment to the living conditions of future occupants. As such the proposal would not be in accordance with policies D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposal provides no amenity space either private or communal and the applicant has not demonstrated that this would be at odds with the prevailing physical context and local character of development. As such the proposal would not be in accordance with policies D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
