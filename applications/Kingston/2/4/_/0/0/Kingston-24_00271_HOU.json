    "The proposed development would be incongruous and would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "By reason of height and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 5 Woodlands Road by reason of an unacceptable loss of light and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
