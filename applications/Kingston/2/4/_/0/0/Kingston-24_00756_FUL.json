As such the proposal would fail to accord with the NPPF 2023, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS3 and DM5 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

The proposal therefore would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",

As such the proposal would not comply with Policy G6 of the London Plan and Policies CS3 and DM6 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as inserted by Schedule 14 of the Environment Act 2021)."
