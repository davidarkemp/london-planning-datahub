    "The proposed development would be highly visible, prominent and incongruous and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed extension by reason of its height and depth along the shared boundary with No. 42 Avenue Road would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to the closest first floor habitable room window at No. 42 Avenue Road.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of trees of amenity value within a conservation area through damage to the Root Protection Areas. The proposal would not accord with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
