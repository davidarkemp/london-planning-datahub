    "By reason of its siting and excessive depth along the boundary, the proposed single storey rear extension would have an overbearing impact on the neighbouring property at no 46 Mount Pleasant Road and therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012)",
    "By reason of its scale, form, bulk, height, mass, the proposed front extension would not appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, would be excessive in scale, would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012)."
