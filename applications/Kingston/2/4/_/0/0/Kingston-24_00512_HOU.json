    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension together with the hip to gable extensions, would by virtue of their scale, mass and design create a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy  (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)"
