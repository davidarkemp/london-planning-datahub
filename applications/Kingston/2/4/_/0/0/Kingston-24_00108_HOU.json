    "The proposed dormer and hip to gable extension by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties the application site forms part of and be a dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive feature in the public and private views of the site that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD 2013."
