The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance and impact on neighbouring amenity, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CSS8  and DM10 of the Core Strategy ."
