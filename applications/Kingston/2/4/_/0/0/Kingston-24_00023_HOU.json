    "Given its prominent location and by virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed two storey front  and side extensions would appear as a dominant and disproportionate additions to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Its monolithic appearance and proposed bulk would unbalance No 51 Blakes Avenue and disturb the symmetry shared by the dwellings, resulting in an unacceptable visual impact on the street scene. The proposed development would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
