    "Based on the submitted, limited information and given the existing high quality materials and design of the host dwelling, the proposed UPVc fascia and soffits would not be of an adequate quality. They would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the conservation area and would fail to preserve its significance, contrary  to Policies CS8,  DM10, DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021).",

Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated how this element of the proposal would affect the amenities of the adjoining occupiers. As such the proposal is contrary to Policies CS8,  DM10, DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2023)."
