    "The proposal would erode the spaciousness of this plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In this regard, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Guidance 2012.",
    "The proposed development by reason of it scale and siting would adversely impact the amenities of No. 54 Fullers Avenue through visual dominance, loss of outlook and sense of overbearing when viewed from the rear garden area and would adversely impact the amenities of No. 58 Fullers Avenue through visual dominance, loss of outlook, loss of privacy and overlooking, contrary to the policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted for the proposed vehicle crossover, as such, officers are unable to determine whether the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety and the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
