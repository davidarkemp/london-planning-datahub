As such the proposal would be contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the LDF Residential Design SPD. \r",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would be an incongruous addition to the site and its surroundings, having a cramped appearance of being shoe-horned on to the site and would be a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive in the public and private views of the site that would detract from the character and appearance of the host site and its surroundings. As such the proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proximity and orientation of the proposed dwelling to the rear of the site fronting Chillmark Gardens in relation to the donor pretty and that of the replacement dwelling would be likely to create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the donor property and the replacement property to the detriment of the occupants of those properties' outlook. As such the proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "It is likely that due to the orientation and proximity of the new dwelling to the rear of the garden of 68 Motspur Park the neighbouring occupiers of that property would be likely to have increased overlooking of their outdoor private amenity space to the detriment of their existing living conditions. As such the proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the replacement dwelling would not cause adverse impact on the daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers at 68 Motspur Park. As such the proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
