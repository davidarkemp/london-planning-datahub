    "The proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/ sunlight and would not pass the BRE '45 degree test' with regards to daylight as set out in the Council's Residential Design in relation to property no 18 York Road. It is considered that the proposed development would have a significant and unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013.",
    "By reason of its siting and combined height and depth along the shared boundary, the proposed single storey rear extension is considered to have an overbearing impact  and an undue sense of enclosure to the neighbouring property of no 18 York Road and is thereby contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021  and Policies CS8 and DM10 in the Core Strategy (2012)."
