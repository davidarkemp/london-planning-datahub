    "The proposed first floor side/rear extension  is of a poor design and would be highly visible, prominent and incongruous when viewed from neighbouring properties and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023)."
