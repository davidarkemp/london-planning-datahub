This condition is exempt from deemed discharge under schedule 6 of The Town and Country Planning (Development  Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015.\r\rReason: This pre-commencement condition is necessary to safeguard the archaeological interest on this site. Approval of the WSI before works begin on site provides clarity on what investigations are required, and their timing in relation to the development programme. Without this pre-commencement condition  permission would be refused as it would not comply with NPPF, 2024 paragraph 218.\r",
