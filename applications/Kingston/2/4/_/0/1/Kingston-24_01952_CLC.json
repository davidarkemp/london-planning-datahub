Installation of decontamination grates and boot cleaning brushes  at all player and  vehicle entrance gates. Ensuring all stormwater drains around the pitch have suitable microfilters to capture  any infill being carried by surface water run off. Attached is the EN Guidance FF adopted in 2020 for all our funded artificial pitches and it can also be located here https://www.estc.info/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/FprCENTR-17519-Public.pdf  Applicants should  refer to the guidance when proposing infill retention  and mitigation measures in their 3G pitch designs. In addition to this, there are new details regarding this floodlight specification.'\r\rIn light of the comments above,  Officers would recommend  the Football Foundation comments are thoroughly reviewed  prior to any future application being submitted to discharge  Condition 6.\r\rOfficers conclude the details submitted to discharge Condition 6 ( 3G Pitch details)  of planning permission 23/01733/FUL are unacceptable. \r"
