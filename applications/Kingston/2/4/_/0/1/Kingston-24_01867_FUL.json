    "The proposed accommodation, specifically Flat 1, would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of internal floor space and built in storage space for a single-storey 1-bed, 2-person unit, as set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers conclude that the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021",
    "The proposed window to the western (rear) elevation would not be in keeping with the proportions of the fenestration to the property and would introduce a relatively modern style of window to the building. The proposals would result in less than substantial harm to the locally listed building and Old Malden conservation area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and paragraphs 205-214 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "In the absence of an executed Unilateral Undertaking to ensure that the development is car capped i.e. current and/or future occupants of the development would not be able to obtain car parking permits, the proposed development would be highly likely to lead to inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets, which would, in turn, compromise highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
