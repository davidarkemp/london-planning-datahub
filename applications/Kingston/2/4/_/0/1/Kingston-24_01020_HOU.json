    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would erode the spaciousness of the plot and the existing gap between the neighbouring property which provides a visual relief and break in the built form creating an incongruous addition to the host property which would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring properties in particular from 73 Windsor Avenue. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would result in an overbearing and dominant feature on the boundary and create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers at 73 Windsor Avenue to the detriment of their existing living conditions. Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design could result in some loss of daylight to the neighbouring occupiers at 73 Windsor Avenue to the detriment of their existing living conditions. The applicant has failed to demonstrate this would not be the case. Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the detail submitted the applicant has not fully demonstrated that the proposed development would comply with criteria 1-6 of London Plan Policy D12."
