    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 44 (Flood Resistant Measures) of planning permission 22/02905/FUL. \r\rCondition 5 was requested by the Environment Agency (EA) and requires details of flood resistance measures to be submitted prior to occupation to reduce the risk of flooding to the proposed development and future users.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a document with flood resistance measures prepared by Darling Associates Architects (dated July 2024). The EA has reviewed this document and does not recommend Condition 44 is discharged as active rather than passive resistance measures have been proposed, as required by the condition.  Passive flood resistance measures require no human intervention or power source to be implemented. Active flood resistance measures require human intervention to be deployed. The EA has recommended two potential options for overcoming their objection which is publicly available on Council's website. Officers recommend this advice is thoroughly reviewed prior to any future application being submitted to discharge Condition 44. \r\rOfficers conclude the details submitted to discharge Condition 44 (Flood Resistant Measures) of planning permission 22/02905/FUL are unacceptable."
