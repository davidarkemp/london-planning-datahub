    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 81 Ronelean Road in terms of loss of daylight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring windows it is considered that there would be a breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Due to the excessive depth of the proposed extension along the shared boundaries with adjoining No 81 Ronelean Road, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable overbearing impact and undue sense of inclosure, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed exterior materials would be similar in appearance to those used in the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. The works would not comply with Condition A.3 (a) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
