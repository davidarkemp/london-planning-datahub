    "The proposed piggyback extension by virtue of its size, siting and design fails to be compliant with Policy Guidance 40 in the RBK Residential Design SPD in terms of set back from the front elevation (wall to wall) such that the extension would be a discordant feature which would harm the character of the area. It would therefore not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Cores Strategy April 2012 and  Policy Guidance 40 in  Residential Design SPD 2013."
