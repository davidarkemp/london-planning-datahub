    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 20 (Basement Impact Assessment) of planning permission 22/03680/FUL (Section 73 to planning permission 20/00945/FUL). The Basement Impact Assessment was required to include details on the methodology for constructing the basement, and the impact of the development on flooding risk, surface water drainage and land stability to ensure flood risk isn't increased on the site or elsewhere, in line with Policies D10 and SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012). \r\rThe applicant has submitted a Basement Structural Impact Assessment and Construction Sequence (prepared by Abstruct Consulting, dated 27.03.2020) that was submitted (but not approved) under the approved scheme 20/00945/FUL, and a statement prepared by Edge Consulting Engineers (dated 17.08.2023) as part of their technical review of Abstruct's Basement Structure Impact Assessment. The Edge's statement concurs with the findings of Abstruct's report with the exception that part of the existing basement structure of No. 25 Fire Road differs to that noted in the Abstruct report. As such, Edge has produced an updated basement section drawing no. 21-0544-EDG-XX-B1-SK-S-9000 REV PO2 in replacement of the section in drawing no. AC19180-S-SK-0001 REVP1 in Abstruct's report. Officers are satisfied that these details have arisen from detailed construction plans and do not conflict with any plans or documents approved under 20/00945/FUL or 22/03680/FUL. \r\rThe Local Lead Flood Authority (LLFA) have reviewed the submitted information and raised no objections to the submitted materials. Council's Pollution Control Team has also raised no objections. \r\rOfficers conclude the details submitted to discharge Condition 20 (Basement Impact Assessment) of planning permission 22/03680/FUL are sufficient."
