    "The proposed development due to its design, form  and appearance, would cause less than substantial harm to the character and appearance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area, which would not be  outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 205 and 208 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2023.\r",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its design with stepped floorplates and squat proportions, with dominant front projecting windows, results in an out-of-proportion building that is not considered to represent a high quality design and fails to positively address the the local context, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan and DM10 of the Core Strategy.",
    "The proposal would result in a reduction in the width of the access road serving  Eden Mews, and the loss of passing places, would lead to conflicts between vehicles, pedestrians and cycles to the detriment to highway safety. The proposal therefore conflicts with Paragraphs 115 and 116 of the NPPF (2023), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS7, DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012), and the Council's Supplementary Planning Document 'Sustainable Travel' (2013).\r",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would provide for adequate  levels of fire safety for the proposed development and those of  neighboring properties in Eden Mews,  contrary to Policies D11 and D12(A) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Clear details of adequate dedicated refuse and recycling store, including  provision of replacement refuse storage facilities forming part of planning permission 16/13202/FUL, have not been submitted, the absence of which, could result in the inconsiderate disposal or storage of waste and recycling materials in the vicinity of neighbours, or on the street which would harm neighbouring amenity and the character of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
