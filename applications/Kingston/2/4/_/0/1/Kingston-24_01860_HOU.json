    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any above-ground works, a detailed landscape & planting plan shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe plan shall include, where appropriate, a clear key or legend corresponding to the landscaping plan and providing the following information:\r\r- Replanting of lost trees on a ratio of 2 trees planted for each tree lost\r- Species (both Latin & Common names) for all plants\r- Locations of all plants or areas of planting\r- Plant numbers or planting densities\r- Sizes of all plants and particularly trees 'at time of planting'\r- Details of all hard-landscaping areas including materials \r\rThe approved scheme shall then be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced at the beginning of the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed hedging and front boundary treatment to the front of the site must be maintained at a height no greater than 1m for the lifetime of the development, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure that sufficient visibility splays are retained for the proposed on-site car parking spaces in the interests of pedestrian and highway safety, in accordance with Policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The hard surface as shown on the drawings 10100 Rev 09 Proposed Floor Plans and 40050-01 Neighbour Light Plan shall be made of porous materials, or provision is made to direct run-off water from the hard surface to a permeable or porous area or surface within the curtilage of the dwellinghouse. \r\rReason: To ensure the development would comply with Policy SI 13 (Sustainable Drainage) of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with  hereby approved Arboricultural Impact Assessment Report Ref: TRA 0376 dated 10.06.2024. The approved measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Reasonable Exception Statement hereby approved and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of Fire Safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r"
