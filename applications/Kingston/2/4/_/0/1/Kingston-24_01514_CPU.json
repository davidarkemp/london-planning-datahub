    "Insufficient  and imprecise information has been submitted to demonstrate that, on balance of probability, the proposed external insulation would not materially affect the external appearance  of the dwellinghouse. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed works would comprise works as described under Section 55 (2) (a) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning Act (1990) (as amended) and as such the proposed external insulation is considered to comprise development which would require planning permission.",
    "Due to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans  together with the  scope of the description of development,  Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the character appearance of the host dwelling or the immediate surrounding area."
