    "Planning Condition 46 of planning permission ref: 22/02905/FUL is as follows:\r\r'A Car Park Management Plan demonstrating how the use of the car park will be controlled, including any restrictions and detailing the signage necessary within the site to direct pedestrians and vehicles shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority before the first occupation of the development. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of surrounding residential occupiers and safeguard highways safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with policies DM9 (Managing Vehicle Use for New Developments) and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012'\r\rThe applicant describes the proposed amendment as follows in the submitted Cover Letter:\r\r'Given the material required as above will not be available until Practical Completion, where it will take circa 4 months to co-ordinate and prepare, we seek a 4 month extension of time for the deposit of this application to move from pre-occupation to post-occupation to enable practical completion to be certified as required in the client's contract.'\r\rOfficers consider it necessary for the Car Park Management Plan to be submitted prior to first occupation of the development. Were the development to be occupied without a robust Car Park Management Plan demonstrating how the use of the car park will be controlled (including any restrictions and detailing the signage necessary within the site to direct pedestrians and vehicles) there would likely be highway and pedestrian safety issues and congestion.\r\rThe proposed amendment to Condition 46 is therefore unacceptable as it would likely result in material harm to highway and pedestrian safety and lead to congestion and disruption on the highway network. The application is therefore refused."
