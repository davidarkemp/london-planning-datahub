    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, samples of all new replacement copings and facing brickwork (including proposed brick types, size, colour, texture, face bond and pointing) to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples. \r\rAny existing bricks must be retained and re-used where possible. Any bricks to be removed must be cut out by hand. Any replacement bricks must be fully tied into the wall following the original bond. \r\rAll new work and improvements must match existing original adjacent work in terms of the choice of materials, method of construction and finished appearance. This applies unless differences are shown on the approved drawings or required in other conditions to this permission.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
