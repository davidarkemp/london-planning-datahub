The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade.\r\rIf the noise emitted has a distinguishable, discrete-continuous note (whine, hiss, screech, hum) and/or distinct impulse (bangs, clicks, clatters, thumps), shall be at least 10dB(A) lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
