    "By reason of its excessive depth, the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling that is not in-keeping with the surrounding area. It would result in an unacceptable impact on the wider area and the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth and siting, would be unneighbourly and would appear overbearing when viewed from 38 Hollybush Road. It would significantly reduce levels of outlook from the nearest habitable room on the ground floor creating a 'tunnelling' effect resulting in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of this property. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2023, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
