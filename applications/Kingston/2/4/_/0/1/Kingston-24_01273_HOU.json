    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and roof design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the immediate streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of its siting and combined height and depth along site boundary of Burford Road,the shared boundary, the proposed  part two storey and part single storey rear and side extensions is considered to have an overbearing impact  and increased sense of enclosure on the  application site itself and at its immediate location on the corner of Burford  Road and Idmiston Road  and is thereby contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021  and Policies CS8 and DM10 in the Core Strategy (2012)."
