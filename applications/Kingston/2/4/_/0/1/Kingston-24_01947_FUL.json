    "The proposed development, in terms of the scale, mass, siting and height of the new dwellinghouses, would be visually jarring and overly dominant resulting in unacceptable impacts on the sense of openness that is an important characteristic of the leafy suburban local area, and the proposed front dormer would be an incongruous addition resulting in a  unacceptable deterioration of the appearance of the host property and streetscene, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, and guidance in Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document 2013 and Small Sites Design Narrative (2024).",

    "Insufficient information, in the form of a Preliminary Ecological Appraisal, has been submitted to determine if the proposed development would result in unacceptable impacts on the ecology and biodiversity on the site through the extent of vegetation removal proposed, and that it would be exempt from Biodiversity Net Gain, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by means of no turning facilities for fire-fighting vehicles and no fire-fighting suppression systems being provided, fails to demonstrate the highest standards of fire safety would be achieved, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021 and Requirement B5 of Approved Document B of the Building Regulation 2010."
