    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and part single part  two storey rear extension would by virtue of size and design form an incongruous feature at the application dwelling that would be out of character with the host property and the surrounding properties in the local area. As such, the proposed development is considered harmful to the character and appearance of the existing dwelling, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10  of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Residential Design SPD ( 2013)."
