I am satisfied that this will achieve the required terminal velocity but again, these all appear planned works and evidence is required to demonstrate that it has been carried out.\r\rCondition 8\rNo details have been submitted to discharge this condition. A carbon filter has been documented but there are no details about its residence time. There are also no details about any fine fliter or ESP. These details are required to demonstrate compliance with the required standard of odour abatement as detailed in the condition.\r\rCondition 9 \rInsufficient information has been provided to demonstrate where waste / recycling would be stored on site in a way that would not pose a Fire Safety Risk.\r\rCondition 10\rInsufficient information has been provided to fully address the requirements of the Condition."
