    "Due to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the character appearance of the host dwelling or the immediate surrounding area. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact  in terms of character and appearance, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (20210 and Policies CS8  and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of its siting  and combined height and depth of the proposed southern boundary along the boundary with neighbouring no 88 Tolworth Rise South , it is considered that the proposed development would unduly impact on the amenities of occupiers by reason of overbearing impact and undue sense of enclosure . In addition, it is considered that the proposed development would unduly erode the gap to no 92 Tolworth Rise South resulting in an unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore  contrary with Policies D3 of the London Plan and Policies CS8 and DM10  of RBK Core Strategy  (2012) and  Residential Design SPD  (2013)"
