    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe assessment has been based on the original layout of the dwelling as of 1948. The original rear  building line shows staggered rear elevation. Therefore the proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, contrary to Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii). \r"
