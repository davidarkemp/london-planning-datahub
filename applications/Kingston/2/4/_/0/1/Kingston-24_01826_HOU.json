    "The proposed first floor side extension by virtue of its design and materials,  together with the  materials used as part of the hip to gable roof extension, would not relate well to the host dwelling and would result in an unacceptable impact on the appearance of the pair of semi detached houses and the existing street scene. Furthermore, the overall mass and scale of the first floor rear extension including its bulky roof form would constitute a disproportionate and intrusive addition to the host building. As such the proposal  would result in an unacceptable impact on the character of the host building  and wider area including the Elmcroft Drive Local Area of Special Character, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012, and Policy Guidance 29, 34 and 36 of the  Council's Residential Design Guide."
