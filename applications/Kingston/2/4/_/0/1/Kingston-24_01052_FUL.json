    "The proposed extensions to the existing residential unit would compromise the existing accommodation and result in the unit not having a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for at least 75% of the proposed habitable floorspace as required by Policy D6 of the London Plan and as such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the LDF Residential Design SPD. \r",
    "The proposed ground floor unit would have a poor and limited outlook due to the need to mitigate overlooking from the side passage to the upper flats and ground floor commercial space and the positioning of the waste enclosure to the rear of the proposed amenity space.  The orientation and  limited fenestration of the ground floor unit proposed is likely to mean that the future occupants would have inadequate provision of daylight and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that this would not be the case. As such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and the LDF Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would comply with the fire safety requirements of  Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021 to demonstrate that the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety."
