    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not prejudice the continued community use of the site and adjacent commercial uses with the introduction of a residential use on site and as such the proposed development would not accord with policy D13 (Agent of Change) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient cycle parking for the proposal and as such the proposal would not accord with London Plan Policy T5.",
