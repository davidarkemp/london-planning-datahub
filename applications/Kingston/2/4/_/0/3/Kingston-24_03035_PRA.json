    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development has been assessed against the provisions of Class MA of Schedule 2, Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and found to comply with the required provisions.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the noise level of 35 dB LAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBLAeq, 8 hour and 45 dBLAFmax during the night time (2300 to 0700 hours), in accordance with BS8233:2014, shall not be exceeded. Noise levels in bedrooms should also not normally exceed 45 dB LAmax,F more than 10 times during the night time. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for the occupants of the development, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
