    "The application submitted under the provisions of S73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 seek to amend  planning permission  21/01086/FUL for the Demolition of existing buildings and redevelopment of site to provide a building comprising part one, two, four, five, six and seven storeys in height (including a basement) incorporating residential units, a replacement children's nursery (Class E(f)), a community use space (Class F1 and F2). The amendments proposed would  result in the loss of the agreed mitigation measures in the form of the provision of Â£750,000 to mitigate against the loss of Cairn House hostel, and furthermore would result in the loss of community floorspace in the form of the children' s nursery accommodation.  As such the proposal is contrary to Policy DM14 (Loss of Housing) and DM24 (Protection and Provision of Community Facilities) of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, Policy K6 of the K+20 Area Action Plan  (Provision of Facilities for Arts, Culture, Tourism, Entertainment, Leisure, Recreation, The Community, Faith and Voluntary Sectors and Hotel Accommodation), Policies H8 (Loss of existing housing and estate redevelopment), H12 (Supported and specialised accommodation and GG1 (Building Strong and Inclusive Communities) of the London Plan 2021, and Paragraph 98 of the National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal has failed to robustly demonstrate that the scheme cannot provide on-site affordable housing, as required by Core Strategy Policies DM15 (Affordable Housing) and CS10 (Housing Delivery) Policy H4 (Delivering affordable housing) and H5 (Threshold approach to applications) of the London Plan (2021), and Paragraph 64 of the National Planning Policy Framework."
