    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The garaging and/or car parking shown on the approved plans shall be provided with a hard-bound, adequately-drained, dust-free surface prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained and kept free from obstruction thereafter. It shall not be used for any purposes other than the parking of vehicles for the occupiers of and visitors to the development.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies T4 and T6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the Arboricultural Impact Assessment Method Statement & Tree Protection Plan (DRYAD tree specialists, December 2024). The approved measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Strategy hereby approved and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of Fire Safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '4 Moor Park Gardens Kingston Upon Thames KT2 7UD', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 10.12.2024, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012."
