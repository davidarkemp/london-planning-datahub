    "Due to the overall excessive mass and bulk of the proposal and its siting, it would fail the \"45 Degree Rule\" in relation to the nearest primary habitable openings at No 76 Staunton Road, resulting in an unacceptable adverse impact on the levels of daylight received by this property. Furthermore, the proposed depth of the single storey rear extension and its siting would appear as an overbearing, it would significantly reduce levels of outlook, create a 'tunneling' effect and an undue sense of enclosure in relation to the nearest primary habitable opening at the ground floor level at No 76. As such, the proposal would result in unacceptable harm to the amenities of No 76 Staunton Road contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 32 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r",
    "The overall mass and bulk of the roof and single storey rear extensions would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, resulting in a disproportionate and dominant addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area, in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 33 and 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD."
