  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed flat due to its design, layout and siting would provide a poor standard of accommodation for future residents due to no outlook from principle habitable rooms (living/diningroom and the middle bedroom) and insufficient information to demonstrate that the unit would be  provided with adequate levels of daylight and sunlight, adequate floor to ceiling height and amenity space. As such the proposal would provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed first floor extension due to its design, siting and scale would adversely affect the existing, characteristic gable roof to the front elevation and therefore upset the harmony shared with the adjoining terraced properties. As such the proposal would adversely affect the appearance of the  host dwelling and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Oakhill Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2024), Polices DM10, DM12 and CS8 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Insufficient information had been provided to demonstrate that the proposed two storey rear extension would pass the 25 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings in the side elevations at both adjoining properties Nos 152 and 146 Ewell Road which comprise commercial and residential uses. As such the proposal is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
