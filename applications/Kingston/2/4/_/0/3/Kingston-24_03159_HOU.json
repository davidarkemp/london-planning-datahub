    "The proposed roof alterations by virtue of size, siting and design would diminish the distinctive character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would appear visually intrusive and overly dominant within the street scene resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed alterations are considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of neighbouring property No. 6 Lawrence Avenue as it would result in an unacceptable sense of overlooking and loss of privacy, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
