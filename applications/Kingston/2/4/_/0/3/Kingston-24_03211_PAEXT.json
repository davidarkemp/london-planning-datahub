The submitted application form does not provide further detail nor clarity on the materials to be  used. The applicant is expected to explicitly demonstrate and/or state that the materials would be similar to those of the existing dwelling. In the absence of such confirmation, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would comply with Condition A.3 (a) (materials used in any exterior work shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the  Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
