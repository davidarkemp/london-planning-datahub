    "Notwithstanding the inaccurate and inconsistent depiction of the proposed dormer on the submitted drawings, Officers consider that sufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would be of a poor design and would detract from the symmetry shared with the adjoining semi-detached dwelling. Overall, the proposals are considered to be of a poor and contrived design which would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
