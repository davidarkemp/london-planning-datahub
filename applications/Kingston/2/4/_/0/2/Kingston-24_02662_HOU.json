It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and an unacceptable impact upon amenity of the occupiers of neighbouring nos 17 and 21 Cranes Park Avenue  thereby conflicting with Policy D3 in  the London Plan  (2021) and Core Strategy Policy DM10 (2012) and in the Residential Design Guidance  SPD (2013).\r"
