    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension and monolithic and visually intrusive first floor rear extension would be incongruous and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed 6m deep ground floor and 1st floor rear extension would not be overbearing and unneighbourly and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at No. 23 Waters Road in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring windows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"BRE 25 and 45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring property, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
