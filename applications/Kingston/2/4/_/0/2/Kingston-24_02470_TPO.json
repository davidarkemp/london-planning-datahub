    "Any replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st to April 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\r\rAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\r\rEight of the following will be a suitable replacement species:\r\ra) Norway maple 'Crimson King' (Acer platanoides 'Crimson King')\r\rb) Norway maple (Acer platanoides)\r\rc) Goat WIllow (Salix caprea)\r\rd) Red Oak (Quercus rubra)\r\re) European larch (Larix decidua) \r\rf) Himalayan birch (Betula utilis jacquemontii)\r\rI have to warn you that if one of the above specified replacements is not planted by the end of the first planting season (Oct 1st to April 30th) following the proposed removals, a notice may be served under section 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). However, I trust that such action will not be necessary and I look forward to receiving your full cooperation in this matter. Please ensure that you inform the Council's Tree Officer (james.baker@kingston.gov.uk) with the provision of a photo once the replanting has taken place.\r"
