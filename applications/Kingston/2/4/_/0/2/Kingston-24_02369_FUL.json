    "The proposed development, due to the number and height of floodlights and significant car parking numbers, would be inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on the openness due to the harm to the open character of the site and wider area, including the nearby conservation area. No 'very special circumstances' exist which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and other identified harms. The proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 153 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM5 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information, in the form of a robust and consistent Sports Lighting Statement and Floodlighting Scheme, has been submitted to suitably demonstrate light spillage from the proposed floodlighting would not adversely impact the amenity of sensitive neighbouring residential properties, contrary to Paragraph 198 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, in terms of the significant number of car parks proposed, does not uphold sustainable and active transport objectives and would result in unacceptable adverse impacts on the function and safety of the local highway network, contrary to Paragraph 116 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy T1, T2 and T6 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, in terms of the extent of built structures, light spillage, hard surfacing and landscaping within the 8m buffer zone of the main river, would result in unacceptable impacts on riparian habitat and ecology, contrary to Paragraph 187 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, in the form of a robust and rigorous Flood Risk Assessment, has been submitted to demonstrate the loss in floodplain storage on site would not result in an unacceptable increase in the risk of flooding elsewhere, contrary to Paragraph 170 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
