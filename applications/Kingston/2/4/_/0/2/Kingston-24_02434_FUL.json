This would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8, and DM 10  of the Core Strategy (2012).",

    "The proposed development would be deficient in cycle parking and would not comply with policy T5 of the London Plan and Policy DM 8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
