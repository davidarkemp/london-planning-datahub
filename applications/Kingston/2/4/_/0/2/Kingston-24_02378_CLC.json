    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 5 (Structural Works), 6 (Services and Fixture Details) and 10 (Historic Skirtings and Internal Joinery Details) of planning permission 24/01234/LBC dated 07.08.2024. \r\rCouncil's Heritage Officer has reviewed the details and is satisfied with the details submitted to discharge Condition 6 and 10. Condition 5 requires submission of proposed structural works within a detailed report and method statement. The submitted Cover Letter states no structural works are to be carried out on site and as such, no details have been submitted. However, Officers note the Proposed Ground and First Floor Plan approved under 24/01234/LBC details internal walls that are proposed to be demolished which comprises structural works. Details are required on these works. \r\rOfficers conclude the details submitted to discharge (Structural Works) of planning permission 24/01234/LBC are insufficient. The details submitted for Condition 6 and 10 are supported however, given one application has been submitted, it is refused as a whole."
