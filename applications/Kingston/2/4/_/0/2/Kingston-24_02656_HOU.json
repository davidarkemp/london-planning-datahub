    "The proposed two storey glass link  due to its design and form would not be in keeping or subordinate to the host building. Furthermore, the proposed rear dormer roof extension due to its design and siting would disturb the symmetry of the main roof and would appear as an intrusive addition to the dwelling.  As such the proposal would adversely affect the appearance of the  host dwelling, and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the this part of the Riverside North Conservation Area and the Thameside Strategic Area of Special Character, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Polices DM10, DM12 and CS8 of the Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 38 and 39 the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document.",
