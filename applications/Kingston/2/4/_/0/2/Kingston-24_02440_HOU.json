    "The proposed development would appear incongruous and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed increase in height to the boundary treatment would not be overbearing and unneighbourly to No. 249 Richmond Road which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would adversely impact on the visibility splays of No. 249 Richmond Road and therefore would result in an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety and the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
