    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Conditions 28 (Lighting) of planning permission 22/01359/FUL granted on 24.08.2023\r\rCondition 28 requires details of the location and full specification of all lamps, light levels/spill lamps, support structures, hours of operation and technical details on how impacts on bat foraging would be minimised. \r\rThe Applicant has submitted a Lighting Design (prepared by Orlight Ltd, dated 19.07.2024). The report details luminance level and light spillage for all external areas, including pathways, car parking spaces and outdoor amenity areas. Lighting levels range from 0.26lux to 28.6lux.  No details on hours of operation or mitigation measures for foraging bats have been provided as required by the condition. Officers are not convinced the level of external lighting proposed appropriately mitigates impacts on bats as required under the Institution of Lighting Professional's Bats and Artificial Lighting at Night Guidance Note GN08/23. Specifically, details of column heights, light fittings (i.e. zero upward light), hours of lighting, motion sensor or dimming elements must be provided to allow Officers to determine compliance with Policy DM10 of the LDPF Core Strategy 2012. \r\rOfficers conclude the details submitted to discharge Conditions 28 (Lighting) of planning permission 22/01359/FUL are insufficient."
