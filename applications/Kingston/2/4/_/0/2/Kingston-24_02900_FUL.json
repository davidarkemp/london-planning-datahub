    "The proposed development would result in a poor standard of residential accommodation, as evidenced by the failure  to demonstrate adequate levels of daylight and privacy for the kitchen and living room, and appropriate ventilation for all the rooms. The proposal also fails  to provide  adequate private amenity space, and safe access to the dwelling (given the position of the front door). Furthermore,  it has not been demonstrated that the proposed accommodation would satisfy minimum space standards in terms of  floor to ceiling height (2.5m for at least 75 per cent of the Gross Internal Area of each dwelling). The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the adjoining occupiers at Land at 322 Hook Rise North, and the  potential  future occupiers of 324 Hook Rise North in terms of impact on levels of daylight and privacy, contrary to Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development due its siting and mass, together with and the limited  separation distances from neighbouring development would represent a  cramped and an excessive form of development of this restricted  site. Furthermore, the proposed design of the north elevation, due to inconsistent and chaotic fenestration treatment and insufficient buffer zone between the private and public space, would represent a poor quality design that would be not in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. This carries significant weight against the proposal.",
    "Based on the submitted information and considering the relevant planning history of the site (ref 24/00252/FUL) and the  restricted size of the application site, it is unclear if the provision of waste and recycling storage and secure cycle storage could be accommodated and how it would impact the existing arrangements for the existing flats at No 326. Therefore, insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposal would be in accordance with Policy T4 and T5 of The London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 and CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. This also carries significant weight against the proposal."
