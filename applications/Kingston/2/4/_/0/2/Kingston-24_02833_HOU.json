    "By reason of its siting, scale, design and height, the proposed front porch extension would be an incongruous addition to the host dwelling and  therefore  would be  visible and dominant within  the existing terrace dwelling block and be  out of keeping with the character and appearance within the immediate streetscene.The proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 in the LDF Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "By reason of its siting, the proposed front porch extension would reduce the depth of the existing drive at 103 Porchester Road and thereby would be contrary to the minimum drive depth standards as set out in the RBK Vehicle Crossover Policy ( December 2018). The reduction in depth would increase the risk of overhanging of a parked vehicle onto the public highway and impede on the highway safety of pedestrians."
