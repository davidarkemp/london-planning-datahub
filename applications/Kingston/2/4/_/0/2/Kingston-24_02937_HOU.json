    "By reason of height, scale, mass and design, the proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012",
    "In the absence of a Daylight Assessment to demonstrate to the contrary, Officers have assessed the proposals against the BRE Guidance (2022) and it is considered that the proposed extension would likely result in an unacceptable adverse impact to the residential amenity of neighbouring property No.183 Canbury Park Road in terms of a material loss of daylight, thereby conflicting with conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013."
