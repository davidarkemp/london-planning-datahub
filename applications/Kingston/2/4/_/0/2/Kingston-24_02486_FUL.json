    "Insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development would be a self-build home. Were it to be demonstrated the home would be self-build, no means of securing it as such has been submitted. As such, it has not  been demonstrated that the proposed development would be exempt from Biodiversity Net Gain, contrary to Schedule 7A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, in terms of its excessive development footprint, poor siting and new vehicle crossover location, would result in unacceptable impacts on trees and limit the space available on-site for tree replacement planting which would be detrimental to the important leafy, green character of the local area and lead to less than substantial harm to the Christ Church Conservation Area. The harm to the Conservation Area is not outweighed by any public benefits, contrary to Paragraph 208 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, and policy guidance in Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document 2013, and Small Sites Design Narrative 2024.",
    "Insufficient information, in the form of a rigorous and robust Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan, has been provided to accurately determine the extent of tree impacts proposed by the development, contrary to Paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, in terms of the location of the new vehicle crossover in proximity to the root protection area of an established street tree which has a high amenity value, would result in unacceptable impacts on the tree's viability and stability, contrary to Paragraph 136 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r"
