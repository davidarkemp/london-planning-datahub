    "The proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of neighbouring property No. 32 Acacia Grove as it would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the principle window of the nearest ground floor habitable room, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed 1st floor rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at No. 36 Acacia Grove in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring windows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"BRE 25 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring dining room, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
