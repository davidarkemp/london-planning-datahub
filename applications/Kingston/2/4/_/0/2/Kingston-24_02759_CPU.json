    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed outbuilding comprising a physiotherapy and disability retreat would be for a purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the house. Based on the submitted information and on the balance of probability, the proposal is considered not to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The proposal would amount to development (material change of use of the property) requiring planning permission.",
    "The height of the building would exceed 2.5m in height and would be within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the dwellinghouse and would therefore be contrary to E.1(e)(ii) of Class E of Schedule 2, Part 1 of The Town and Country Planning (England) (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended)."
