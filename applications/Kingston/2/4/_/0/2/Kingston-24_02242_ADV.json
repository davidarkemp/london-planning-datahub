    "The proposed signage by virtue of its size and design and material finish would be an unsympathetic addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and be visually intrusive in the streetscene and fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and detract from the special architectural integrity of the locally listed building causing less than substantial harm to the designated and non- designated heritage assets. As such the proposal would not accord with paragraphs 195 - 214 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021."
