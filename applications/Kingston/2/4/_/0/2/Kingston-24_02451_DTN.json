    "Any replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground\rservices, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and\r\rthe nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order\rto achieve the best result for your site.\rOne of the following will be a suitable replacement species:\r\r(a) Crataegus monogyna (Common hawthorn)\r\r(b) Amelanchier arborea Robin Hill (Serviceberry)\r\r(c) Malus Rudolph (Rudolph crab apple)\r\rI have to warn you that if one of the above specified replacements is not planted by the end of the first\rplanting season (Oct 1st to April 30th) following the proposed removals, a notice may be served under\rsection 207 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). However, I trust that such action will\rnot be necessary and I look forward to receiving your full cooperation in this matter. Please ensure that you\rinform the Council's Tree Officer (james.baker@kingston.gov.uk) with the provision of a photo once the\rreplanting has taken place."
