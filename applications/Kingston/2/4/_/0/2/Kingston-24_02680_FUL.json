    "The proposed development fails to demonstrate the loss of the existing specialised accommodation, community facility and employment generating use is justified. Insufficient evidence has been submitted, in the form of marketing evidence, to demonstrate there is no quantitative or qualitative need for the existing care home; or there is no longer need for any community use or employment generating use on-site or they could not be re-provided to an equivalent or better standard elsewhere, contrary to Policy H8 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy DM17 and DM24 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal, due to its net loss of 5 residential dwellings, would worsen the Council's housing land supply position at a time when the Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year housing supply, contrary to Policy H1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS10 and DM14 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, due to its failure to provide 30% of new dwellings as family-sized units, fails to contribute towards the borough's family housing stock, contrary to CS Policy DM13 and the objectives sought under the Kingston Local Housing Needs Assessment 2024.",
    "The proposed development, in terms of the proposed uPVC windows, fails to maintain and enhance the traditional fabric of the existing building which is a positive contributor to the character and appearance of the Claremont Road Conservation Area. The harm to the Conservation Area is not outweighed by any public benefits, contrary to Paragraph 215 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policy CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, and policy guidance in Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document 2013. \r",
    "The proposed development, in terms of the single-aspect north and south facing habitable rooms, fails to provide a suitable standard of accommodation for future occupants due to poor outlook and privacy and inadequate levels of internal daylight/sunlight. Additionally, insufficient information, due to the lack of Section Plans and detailed Proposed Floor Plans, has been submitted to understand whether ceiling height and laundry and drying facilities would be sufficient to achieve a high quality standard of accommodation for future occupants, contrary to Policy D6 in the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the guidelines and standards under Kingston's Housing in Multiple Occupation Standards 2023 and the London Plan Guidance for Large-Scale Purpose-Built Shared Living 2024. \r\r",
    "Insufficient information, due to the lack of a Noise Impact Assessment and Air Quality Assessment, has been submitted to determine whether mitigation measures are required to ensure future occupants would not be exposed to an unacceptable level of noise and air quality whilst avoiding restricting the operations of the neighbouring timber merchant, contrary to Policies SI 1, D13 and D14 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal development, in terms of the provision of 8 off-street car parking spaces, fails to uphold the objectives of car-free development for sites well-connected by public transport (PTAL 5), contrary to Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012, policy guidance under Section 2.1.1(b) of the London Planning Guidance for Large-scale Purpose-built Shared Living 2024 and policy guidance in Council's Sustainable Transport Supplementary Planning Document 2013.\r",
    "Insufficient information, due to the lack of a Bat Survey, has been submitted to determine whether the proposal would not adversely impact on European protected species, contrary to Paragraph 193 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM6 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.  \r",
    "The proposed development, due to a lack of an Urban Greening Factor Assessment and Landscape Plan, has been submitted to demonstrate the proposed development could not further enhance urban greening, biodiversity and the landscaping setting of the site, contrary to Policy G5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012. \r",
    "Insufficient information, in the form of an Energy Assessment, has been submitted to determine whether the proposal has been designed to reduce carbon emissions and support objectives to transition to net zero by 2050, contrary to Paragraph 161 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policy SI 2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM3 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012."
