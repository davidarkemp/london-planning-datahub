    "Due to the submission of inconsistent and unacceptable plans officers are unable to appropriately assess the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the property or the wider area. The elements of the proposal which can be assessed such as the raised roof form and bulky dormer, it is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development, in conflict with the Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Notwithstanding the issues raised by the first reason for refusal, by reason of its bulk and increased height, the proposed development would not appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, would be excessive in scale, would sit uncomfortably with the host building and surrounding properties and within the street scene which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
