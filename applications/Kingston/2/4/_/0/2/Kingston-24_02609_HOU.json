    "By reason of its scale on the rear roof slope of the host dwelling together with the proposed materials, it is considered that  the proposed dormer extension  would dominate the rear roof slope and would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and thereby would result in less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset of  Liverpool Road Conservation Area. In addition, it is considered  the installation of the conservation style rooflights would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling  and the wider area  and thereby would result in less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset of  Liverpool Road Conservation Area. Overall,  the proposal would   conflict with Paragraph 212 of the NPPF (2024), Policy D3 in the London Plan (2021) and Core Strategy Policy DM10 and Policy DM12 (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 in Residential Design SPD (2013)."
