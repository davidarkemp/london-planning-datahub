    "The proposed signage, due to its scale, design and siting, is visually intrusive and would result in unacceptable impacts on the appearance and character of the surrounding area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012. Additionally, insufficient information has been submitted to determine if the proposal would result in harm to existing street trees that contribute to the character of the streetscene and local area, contrary to DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal includes development that extends beyond the red line boundary identified on the submitted location plan and proposed signage details plan. As such, part of the development falls outside the area for which planning permission has been sought. This results in a fundamental procedural issue, as the local planning authority cannot lawfully grant permission for land that is not included within the application boundary and not properly identified as part of the application site. In the absence of a correctly defined application site boundary, the application is incomplete and does not satisfy the requirements of Article 7 and Article 13 of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
