    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed  extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at No. 179 Tudor Drive in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring windows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"BRE 45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring habitable room, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
