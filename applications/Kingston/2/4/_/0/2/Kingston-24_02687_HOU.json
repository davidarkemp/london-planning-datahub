    "The proposed main roof form would not be in-keeping with the immediate surrounding area and the properties that share symmetry and similar design to the application site and would appear as intrusive, resulting in an adverse impact on the existing street scene and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. Furthermore, the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of robust evidence that the proposed changes in the ground level would be in-keeping with the surrounding area. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",

As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
