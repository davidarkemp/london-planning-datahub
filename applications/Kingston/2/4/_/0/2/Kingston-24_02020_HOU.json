    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension  together with the raising of the flat roof area on the main roof of the dwelling, would by virtue of their scale, mass and design create a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character  and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord  with policies Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design SPD (2013)."
