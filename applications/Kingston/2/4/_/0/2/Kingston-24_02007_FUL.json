    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows on the side elevations on the first and second floors of the building that service bathrooms shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Notwithstanding the details of the bin storage included in the approved plans, no development above ground shall commence until details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The details must demonstrate how a minimum of 1,650L of refuse storage capacity and 825L of recycle storage capacity can be accommodated in the rear outdoor amenity space within an enclosed storage facility that is secure and weatherproof. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rWhere any conflict arises between the approved drawings listed under Condition 1 and this condition (Condition 4), and so far as it relates to the bin storage, any conflict should be resolved in favour of this condition (Condition 4).\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, and Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document."
