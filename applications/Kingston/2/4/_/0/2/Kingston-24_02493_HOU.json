    "The proposed development would be incongruous and would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed crossover would result in the loss of a significant amount of grass verge. The loss of the grass verge would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DM 6 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy."
