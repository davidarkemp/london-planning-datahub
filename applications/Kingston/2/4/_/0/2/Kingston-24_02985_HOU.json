    "It is considered that the loss of the existing hanging tiles on the front and west elevations of the dwelling would have an adverse impact on  both the character and appearance of the dwelling itself, the immediate streetscene and the dwelling's contribution towards the Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of  Special Character. It is therefore considered that the proposal would  be contrary  to Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Given lack of a bat survey work and other ecological survey work, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not adversely affect the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site, contrary to policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient robust evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the run off from the extended rear terrace and it direct discharge towards the boundary planting would not increase the flood risk to neighbouring properties particularly no 13, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and paragraph 181 of NPPF (2024).\r"
