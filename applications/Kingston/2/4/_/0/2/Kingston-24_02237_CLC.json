    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 44 (Flood Resistant Measures) of planning permission 22/02905/FUL. \r\rCondition 44 was requested by the Environment Agency (EA) and requires details of flood resistance measures to be submitted prior to occupation to reduce the risk of flooding to the proposed development and future users.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a document with flood resistance measures prepared by Darling Associates Architects (dated September 2024). The EA has reviewed this document and does not recommend Condition 44 be discharged as active rather than passive resistance measures have been proposed, as required by the condition. \r\rAs outlined in the EA's response for the previously refused application to discharge Condition 44 (24/01735/CLC), if active flood resistance measures are proposed the wording of Condition 44 must be varied to reflect this. This can occur via a non-material amendment application under Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). It must include evidence of planning constraints demonstrating it is not possible to pursue passive flood resistance measures. If this is not possible to achieve, the scheme should be revised to include passive flood resistance measures, as required by the current condition wording. \r\rOfficers conclude the details submitted to discharge Condition 44 (Flood Resistant Measures) of planning permission 22/02905/FUL are unacceptable."
