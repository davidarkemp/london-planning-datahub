    "Due to the failure to submit an Arboricultural Impact Assessment, and in the absence of agreement to a pre-commencement condition requiring an Arboricultural Impact Assessment and any necessary Method Statement and Protection Plan, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would not harm existing trees of amenity value which contribute positively to the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area. It therefore has not been demonstrated that the proposals preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021)."
