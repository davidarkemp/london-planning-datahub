    "The proposed rear dormer, given its scale, mass and bulk would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would appear intrusive and not in-keeping with the surrounding area. Furthermore, the proposed fenestration to the side and rear elevations that would be fully visible with the existing street scene lacks rhythm and consistency. Therefore, the proposal would adversely affect the character and appearance of the existing street scene, in conflict with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
