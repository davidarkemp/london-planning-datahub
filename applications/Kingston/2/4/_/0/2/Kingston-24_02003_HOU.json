    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of its size, siting and insufficient set-back from the site boundary with No. 162 Elmbridge Avenue would appear as an overbearing and it would unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Due to its scale and siting, the proposed top roof terrace would create a prominent and incongruous feature within the Elmbridge Avenue street scene and it would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal would not accord with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The excessive height and mass of the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as an overbearing and it would be unneighbourly when viewed from to the adjoining property, No 158 Elmbridge Avenue. Furthermore, the proposed top roof terrace would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or an undue overlooking in relation to the neighbouring properties. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
