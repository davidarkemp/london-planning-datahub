    "\rThe application site relates to the multi-storey carpark for the Bentalls Department Store. The site is located within the heart of the Kingston Town Centre on a secondary shopping frontage. The site is located within the Proposed Development Site P12 (Northern Riverfront) under the Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan K+20 area (KTCAAP). The immediate surrounding area is characterised by a mix of commercial, administrative, cultural, retail and residential uses. \r\rThe site is located just north, but not within, the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. It is located within the Thames Side Strategy Area of Special Character. The nearby Bentall Department Store is a Grade II Listed Building. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal seeks planning permission for the erection of security fencing to the perimeter of the top level of the Bentall Centre multi-storey carpark. \r\rRelevant History: \r\rThe site has been subject to a number of applications. The most recent and relevant applications are detailed below: \r\r19/00418/FUL: External refurbishment of Bentalls Car Park A including new cladding, lighting, signage, external landscaping and alterations to the entrance to car park. Granted 21.05.2020. \r\r19/00419/ADV: Display of 4 illuminated signs and 7 non illuminated signs. Granted 21.05.2020. \r\r14/12071/FUL: Application under S.73 of the Act: for a Variation of Condition for a variation to Condition 8 of Planning Permission 99/0342/FUL to reduce the number of car parking spaces from 607 to 606 spaces. Granted 19.03.2014. \r\r09/12372/FUL: Replacement of a metal louvre cladding system to ductwork to rear of Anstee House and the introduction of new security fencing and panels for a multi-storey car park. Granted 10.09.2009. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 325 neighbours were consulted. A total of 1 objection has been received which did not raise issues relating to the proposal. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\rCharacter, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets\rSafety\rFire Safety\r\rCharacter, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets:\r\rNational Planning Policy Framework 2024 (NPPF) para 131 states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rParagraphs 213 to 221 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 (LP) and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 (CS) echo these requirements.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Policy K1 and K9 of the KTCAAP and CS Policy CS8 and DM10 echo these requirements. \r\rThe proposal is for the erection of a high-level mesh fencing on the perimeter and parapet wall of the top-level car park to provide greater safety and security to the site. The existing situation includes a 52cm high guard rail on top of the concrete parapet. The proposal seeks to remove the guard rail and install a 2.7m grey high grey coated metal security fence. The fence will be secured by fixed posts to the floor and the interior side of the existing walls and parapets. \r\rThe subject property is not within a conservation area however, consideration of the setting of the nearby conservation area and Bentall Centre Grade II Listed Building is important. The site is separated from the Bentall Centre by Wood Street and is approximately 27m away. Officers do not consider the proposal would be detrimental to the setting of the Grade II Listed Building. \r\rThe fence would not exceed the height of existing rooftop structures but will be significantly more visible than the existing low guard rails when moving along the A308. The Council’s Conservation and Heritage Officer and Design Officer have reviewed the proposal and consider the height and material of the proposed fencing adds inappropriate bulk and articulation to the top of the building. If the screening was culturally or articulately represented, it may be supportable as it would enhance how the building is viewed from the streetscape. \r\rOfficers consider the proposal would be detrimental to the appearance of the host building and would not enhance the character and appearance of the local area and streetscape, contrary to LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rSafety: \r\rNPPF at paragraph 102 states that planning decisions should promote public safety and security. This is echoed in LP Policy D11 which recognises development must maintain a safe and secure environment and reduce the fear of crime. \r\rCS Policy CS14 and DM22 states the Council will seek to improve community safety through incorporating 'Secured by Design', 'Designing out Crime' and 'Safer Places' principles in development proposals. \r\rThe proposal aims to improve safety at the top of the 12-storey building by increasing the height of protective railings on the top floor of the carpark to prevent falls. The fencing height, anti-climb features and durability would align with LP Policy D11 and CS Policy CS14 and DM22 and is considered acceptable.  \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rNo Fire Statement was submitted. Officers consider the proposal would generally not alter any existing fire strategies or any internal or external communal areas that support the evacuation strategy. A Fire Statement would be secured by condition to ensure compliance with LP Policy D12. \r\tConclusion:\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. While the proposed fencing would be in the interest of public safety and security, Officers do not consider the proposal would enhance the character and appearance of the town centre setting, contrary to LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. The proposed development is not considered to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. Officers recommend planning permission is refused.\r"
