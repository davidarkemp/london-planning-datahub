    "By virtue of its excessive depth, scale and mass the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a dominant and disproportionate addition that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the proposed rear extensions would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension due to its excessive depth, mass and bulk would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining property No 57 South Lane in terms of unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the nearest habitable opening at the ground floor level and an overbearing appearance. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed chimney to the proposed rear extension would not result in an adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining properties. As such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
