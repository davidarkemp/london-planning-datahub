    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision. \r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990 (As amended)\r",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby approved, details of boundary treatment (or privacy screens) of a minimum of 1.8m in height along the outside edge of the proposed raised patio/decking in the vicinity of the shared boundary with No. 9 Romney Close shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The boundary treatment or privacy screens shall be installed and thereafter retained in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: Due to the site topography the proposed raised decking/patio could give rise to an unacceptable loss of privacy to the rear garden of neighbouring No. 9 Romney Close. The proposed boundary treatment/privacy screens would safeguard neighbouring privacy in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
