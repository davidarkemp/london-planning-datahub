    "The proposed hip to gable roof extensions would add considerable bulk to the roof which would further erode the characteristic gaps between properties at roof level which contribute positively to the relatively spacious and suburban character of the area. The proposed roof extensions would unbalance the symmetry shared with adjoining No. 18 also. The development would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area, contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021)."
