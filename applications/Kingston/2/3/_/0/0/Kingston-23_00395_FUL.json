As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The removal of the front boundary wall appears out of keeping with the prevailing character of the street. The proposal  would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area in conflict with the NPPF 2021, Policies D3  of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits in the event of a future CPZ, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012."
