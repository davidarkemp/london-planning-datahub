    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and consistent evidence or robust justification that the existing community use of the site is no longer needed, that it has been vacant and marketed for a community use without success, or it can be re-provided elsewhere or in a different way. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy S1 of the London Plan (2021) and DM 24 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal, by reason of its design, combined footprint, width, height, scale, mass and dominant top floor is considered to result in a poor quality and incongruous form of development that fails to respond positively to the character of the surrounding area, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal, by reason of its inadequate floor to ceiling height and distance to boundaries, resulting in poor levels of outlook, is considered represent a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm protected species and their habitats, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed level of off street parking falls short of the London Plan maximum parking standards and, with no mechanism secured for 2 year car club membership for all units, the proposal is contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The site is accessed via a narrow walkway with the entrance to the building approximately 30m from Barton Green road and it is therefore unclear whether the development would provide suitable access to firefighting personnel, along with the other requirements of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021). In the absence of a robust Fire Statement being submitted it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021)."
