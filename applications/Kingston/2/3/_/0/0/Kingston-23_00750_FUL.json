    "The proposal is not considered to represent a coherent design. The proposed materials palette is at odds with the prevailing materiality in Southborough Conservation Area.  The overall scale, massing and roof height and mix of roof forms would fail to positively respond to neighbouring properties, or the wider Southborough Conservation Area. In this way, the proposals would result in considerable harm to the character and appearance of the area. This would be contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The overprovision of on-site car parking per dwelling in excess of the maximum standards set out in Table 10.3 of the London Plan (2021), would fail to encourage the use of more sustainable modes of travel such as public transport or cycling, and diminish the sustainability of the proposal, contrary to Policy T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and paragraphs 107 and 108 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of technically sufficient and robust information that the proposed development would not harm protected trees or trees of amenity value which contribute positively to the character and appearance of the site, the wider area and Southborough Conservation Area, contrary to Policies DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of robust information by way of a preliminary ecological assessment or species surveys that the development would not cause harm to protected species or their habitats, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021)."
