    "The external finish of the proposed signage would not be  of an architectural style sympathtic to the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, thereby failing to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area resulting in less than substantial harm to its significance. As such the proposed advertisement would not be in accordance with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 208 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy",
    "The proposed signage by virtue of its siting and design and particular method of illumination directly below residential windows is likely to give rise to light pollution that would be harmful to the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers and therefore cause harm to the neighbouring occupiers residential amenities. The proposal therefore is not in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
