The proposals would detract from the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, the NPPF (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012"
