    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance and in particular its height and associated equipment cabinets would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
