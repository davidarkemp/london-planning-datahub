    "The proposal due to its excessive depth, bulk and mass, would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. It would result in a dominant and incongruous appearance which would have an unacceptable impact on the immediate surrounding area. Given the above the proposal is in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 33 and 34 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposal by reason of its siting, excessive depth, bulk and mass would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining properties in terms of an overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure to No. 55. The proposed single storey rear extension would result in a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No. 55 Norbiton Avenue. As such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
