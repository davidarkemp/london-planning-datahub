    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of its size, siting and insufficient set-back from the site boundary with No. 168 Elmbridge Avenue would unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed roof stair enclosure due to its scale and siting to the front of the property would create a prominent and incongruous feature within the Elmbridge Avenue street scene and it would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal would not accord with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
