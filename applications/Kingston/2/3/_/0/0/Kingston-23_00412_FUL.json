The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rAny trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced during the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows inserted above the ground floor in the flank elevations of the extensions hereby permitted shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
