    "No development shall take place (including any works of demolition) until a construction management plan or construction method statement has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rThe approved plan/statement shall be adhered to throughout the construction period. The statement shall provide for: i) How the proposed development will be built; ii) Hours of working (which shall be limited to 08.00 to 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 to 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays); iii) The procedure for loading/unloading materials; iv) The route to and away from site for muck away and vehicles with materials; v) The protocol for managing deliveries to one vehicle at a time on sites with restricted access or space; vi) The protocol for managing vehicles that need to wait for access to the site; vii) Whether any reversing manoeuvres are required onto or off the public highway into the site and whether a banksman will be provided; viii) Temporary site access; ix) Signing system for works traffic; x) Whether site access warning signs will be required in adjacent roads; xi) Whether it is anticipated that statutory undertaker connections will be required into the site; xii) The storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles; xiii) The potential for impacts from dust and emissions during the demolition and/or construction phase upon local air quality and surrounding residents; xiv) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works; xv) The location of all ancillary site buildings; xvi) The means of enclosure of the site, its erection and maintenance; xvii) Wheel washing equipment; xviii) The parking of vehicles of site operatives and visitors; xix) Meeting the requirements of the Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile Machinery (where relevant plant or vehicles are being used); and xx) The method of recycling and disposing of waste resulting from the demolition and/or construction phases Deliveries/collections to and from the site shall use a route that is agreed with the highway authority and the agreed route shall be signed accordingly.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. This condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective. \r",
    "Prior to the commencement of development, a Fire Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: 1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; 2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; 3) Passive and active fire safety measures; 4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; 5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy; 6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021. This is required prior to commencement as it goes to the heart of the scheme design. \r",
    "The hours of working during the development phase shall be restricted to the following: Monday - Friday: 8am - 6pm Saturday: 8am - 1pm No working on Sundays or Bank Holidays. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenity of the occupants of surrounding premises during the demolition/construction phase. \r",
    "Prior to commencement of development, a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the noise level of 35 dB LAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dB LAeq,8 hour during the night time (2300 to 0700 hours) in bedrooms, in accordance with BS8233:2014, shall not be exceeded. Noise levels in bedrooms should also not normally exceed 45 dB LAmax,F more than 10 times during the night time. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. The approved scheme shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter. \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for the occupants of the development, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and the details are likely to affect the design of other elements of the scheme. \r",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The cycle parking facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained for that purpose and kept free from obstruction thereafter. \r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r",

Once approved, any measures necessary to meet the targets shall be maintained throughout the lifetime of the development. \r\rReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation, in accordance with policies CS1, DM3 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates (other than those that are set out as amenity space or similar) shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency. \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the proposed development hereby permitted details of a privacy screen, to be located around the perimeter of the first floor roof terrace, measuring 1.8m high measured from the floor level of the roof terraces around the perimeter, shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the local planning authority. The screen shall be erected prior to the occupation of the development and thereafter permanently retained. \r\rReason: In order to ensure the privacy and visual amenity of neighbouring occupiers is retained in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r"
