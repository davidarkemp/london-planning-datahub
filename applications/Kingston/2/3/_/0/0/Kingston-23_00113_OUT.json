    "The proposal would not provide a minimum of 30% 3+bedroom units without robust justification, as such, the proposal is contrary to Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed building, by reason of its design, building line, height, depth, scale, mass, form, dominant top floor and lack of articulation is considered to represent a poor quality and incongruous form of development that fails to respond positively to the surrounding townscape along King Charles Road, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021,  policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed building, by reason of the siting of first floor flank windows and the building's combined height and depth beyond the first floor rear window of No. 171 King Charles Road, is considered to result in undue levels of overlooking and sense of enclosure to the occupiers of the neighbouring 171 King Charles Road, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy and the NPPF (2021).",
    "By reason of the siting and combined height and depth of the proposed building, and in the absence of a detailed daylight and sunlight assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would avoid an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to No. 171 King Charles Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of inadequate GIA floorspace and width of single bedrooms, poor outlook and privacy to the ground floor habitable spaces (facing King Charles Road), inadequate floor to ceiling heights, deep and narrow floor plans, poorly sited windows and lack of private amenity space, is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation contrary to the Nationally Described Space Standards, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed units, particularly the ground floor studio unit, would be served by adequate levels of daylight, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed level of off street parking falls short of the London Plan maximum parking standards and it has not been demonstrated through a Transport Statement and Parking Survey that vehicles could safely enter/egress the site in forward gear and that the proposal would avoid an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions, highway safety and the surrounding highway network, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
