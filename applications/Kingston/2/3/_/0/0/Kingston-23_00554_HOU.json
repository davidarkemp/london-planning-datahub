    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension due to its prominent position, bulk and mass, the proposed design and materials that are not characteristic to the area, would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. It would result in a jarring and incongruous appearance which would have an unacceptable impact on the existing  street scene and the immediate surrounding area. Given the above the proposal is in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r",
    "The proposal by reason of the insufficient separation distances, proposed design and materials and its prominent siting  would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining properties in terms of overlooking and loss of privacy. It would appear overbearing and visually intrusive when viewed from the adjoining properties. As such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
