    "The proposed roof extension by virtue of its size, siting, and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and cause harm to the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. The proposal therefore would not accord with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10, and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core strategy.",
    "The application is not supported by a fire safety strategy and as such officers are not satisfied that the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development would not have any fire safety concerns as such the proposal would not be in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021."
