    "The proposed development by virtue of the proposed car parking provision/layout and access would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety and pedestrian safety, contrary to Policy T4 of the London Plan and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed new dwellinghouse would be provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed new dwellinghouse would be provided with inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS9 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposed development, with specific regard to the first floor side extension and lack of adequate set back from the boundary, is considered to result in an adverse terracing effect deterimental to the established character and appearance of the streetscene on this section of Douglas Road. The proposals are therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012."
