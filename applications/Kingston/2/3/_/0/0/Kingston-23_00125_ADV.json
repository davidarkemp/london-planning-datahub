    "The proposed external shop window mounted signage by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not be  of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and be visually intrusive in the streetscene which would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and cause less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset of the  Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the non designated heritage asset the Thames-Side Special Area of Strategic Character failing to preserve or enhance their character and appearance. As such the proposed advertisement would not be in accordance with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 208 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy"
