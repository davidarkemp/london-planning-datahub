    "By reasons of its design, siting, height, scale and proximity to neighbours, the proposed two storey extension is considered to result in an unacceptable overbearing impact, increased sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining properties at 52 and 56 Coombe Road. The proposal is therefore considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and the proposal is in conflict with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate by way of a daylight/sunlight analysis that the the proposed development would not result in a loss of daylight/sunlight that would cause demonstrable harm and diminish the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012)."
