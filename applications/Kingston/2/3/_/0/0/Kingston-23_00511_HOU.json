    "Given the prominent position of the host dwelling, it is considered that the proposed flat roof form over the two storey side and rear extension would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the proposed extensions would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the application property and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
