    "The proposed development results in poor design quality and  over development of the site as evidenced  by the site layout and proximity to the site boundaries, fourth  floor configuration with  internal courtyard arrangement, access arrangements and lack of communal amenity space , which presents a cramped and unwelcoming environment contrary to Policies DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies D3, D5 and D11 of the London Plan 2021 and National Planning Policy Framework  and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposed development, due to the design, bulk and massing  towards Clarence Street  would detract from the appearance of the host building  and  from the character  of  visual amenity of Clarence Street including the wider  setting of the locally listed building  at 40c Clarence Street.  The proposal fails to comply with  Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 and policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The proposal provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents, as evidenced by  access arrangements via rear car park and service yard, poor outlook and separation from the boundaries and  lack of communal amenity space. As such the proposal fails to comply with  Policies D6 and D11 of the London Plan 2021  and Policies DM10 and DM13  of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 14 of the RBK Residential Design SPD and National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal has not demonstrated that the site is acceptable in terms of the risk of flooding with particular regard to the Sequential Test, and fails to adequately  demonstrate  a safe access and escape route out of the flood zone.  As such the proposal is  contrary to Policy SI 12 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012), and National Planning Policy Framework.",
    "The proposal has failed to demonstrate  the highest standard of fire safety and safe  and dignified emergency evacuation for all building users, and as such is contrary to Policies D12 and D5(B5) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal fails to incorporate an appropriate mix of housing, with no provision for   larger dwellings with 3+ bedrooms.  As such the proposal is contrary to Policy  DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\r"
