    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses, such as lower cost and affordable workspace. The net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies E1 and SD9 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset of Fairfield / Knights Park Conservation Area by reason of its siting, bulk, scale, mass and design.  This is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposals would be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and, as such, detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 130, 199, 202 and 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The proposed building would not be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development and is considered to constitute overdevelopment of the plot as it would not incorporate any separation distance from its boundaries and would not address Littlefield Close with an adequate set-back from the street, and poor design with a flat roof and architectural details/materiality/boundary treatment which is inappropriate to the site's heritage setting, thereby creating an uncomfortable relationship with surrounding properties and an incongruous appearance from the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 and policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, policies CS3, DM10 and DM11 of the Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "No private or communal external amenity space is provided to two of the three proposed flats (i.e. upper floor studio flats), contrary to the criteria set out for new dwellinghouses in the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013, Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, specifically in terms of its open rack storage, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate refuse/recycling storage to serve the new development, specifically in terms of absence of any waste storage enclosure, contrary to Policy CS9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its massing and layout would result in unacceptable degree of overbearing and visual dominance when viewed from the rear windows and rear garden areas of these neighbouring properties, with a particularly harmful impact to No's 6 and 7 Fairfield West.The proposals are therefore considered contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted with regards to drainage. In the absence of a drainage strategy and other technical drainage details, the proposals are found to be contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the Council's adopted LDF Core strategy 2012."
