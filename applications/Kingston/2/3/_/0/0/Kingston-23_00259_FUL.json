    "The proposal fails to identify a safe access and escape route out of the flood zone. The proposal also fails to  demonstrate that flood risk would not be increased elsewhere as it does not incorporate  appropriately designed sustainable drainage systems.  As such the proposal is  contrary to Policies SI 12 and   SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  (July 2021), and National Planning Policy Guidance (particularly paragraphs 155 163,164 165 and 167).\r",
    "The proposed building, by reason of its design, building line, height, scale, mass, form, and lack of articulation is considered to represent a poor design quality and an incongruous and cramped form of development that fails to respond positively to the surrounding townscape along Hollyfield Road, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021,  policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021) and and Paragraphs 130 and 143 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the Fishponds Conservation Area  by reason of its bulk, scale, mass and design.  This is not outweighed by any public benefit. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 197, 199,  200, 202 and 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "It has not been demonstrated  that a car free development with  no off site loading facilities,  can be accommodated within  the street without  having an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions including  on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets, and road safety issues in the surrounding highway network. As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012, and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD (2013).",
    "The proposal provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents due to inadequate provision of private amenity space and playspace. As such the proposal fails to comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not harm protected species and their habitats, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2021)."
