    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its siting, scale, height and width, is considered an incongruous and wholly dominant extension that would erode the characteristic gap between the neighbouring 42 Tiverton Way, resulting in harm to the existing building and the character an appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS11 and DM10, of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "The new off street parking spaces fail to meet the width standards set out in the Council's Crossover Policy guidance and it has therefore not been demonstrated that vehicles could safely enter/egress the site and that the proposal would avoid an unacceptable impact on highway safety and the surrounding highway network, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
