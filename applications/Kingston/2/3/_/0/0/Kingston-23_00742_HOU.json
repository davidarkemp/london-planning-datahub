    "Given the height and proximity of the proposed two storey double garage in relation to the shared boundary with 1-3 Derby Road and 10 and 16 Broomfield, and the introduction of first floor windows overlooking the rear gardens and towards the rear elevations of 10 and 16 Broomfield Road, the proposal is considered to result in an undue level of overlooking and an undue sense of enclosure to the occupiers of these neighbouring dwellings. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of scale and design, the proposed double garage would appear overly bulky and prominent within the immediate surrounding area, and would not relate well to prevailing pattern and form of development within the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
