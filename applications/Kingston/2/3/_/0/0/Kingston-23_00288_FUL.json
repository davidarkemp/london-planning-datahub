    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that development would be made safe for its lifetime without increasing flood risk elsewhere, and fails parts 1 and 2 of the Exception test. The proposal also fails to identify a safe access and escape route out of the flood zone. The proposal also fails to demonstrate the provision of an  appropriately designed sustainable drainage system.  As such the proposal is  contrary to Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Strategic Flood Risk Assessment  (July 2021), and National Planning Policy Guidance (particularly paragraphs 155, 163,164, 165 and 167).\r",
    "The proposal provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents due to inadequate ceiling height, poor outlook and separation from the boundaries, lack of both private and communal amenity space, non provision of play space and non provision of step free access. As such the proposal fails to comply with Policies D5, D6, D7 and S4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy Guidance 13 and 16 of the RBK Residential Design SPD, and National Planning Policy Guidance, Paragraph 130.\r\r",
    "The proposed development of  the restricted backland site results in a poor design quality and over development of the site as evidenced by the site layout and ground floor configuration, location of cycle store, lack of communal amenity space and playspace, which presents a cramped, car dominated and unwelcoming environment. The proposal would also compromise future development of land to the south of the site given the close  proximity of windows to the  boundary. As such the proposed development is contrary to Policies DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies D3 and D5 of the London Plan 2021 and National Planning Policy Guidance (particularly paragraphs 126,130 and 134).\r",
    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the designated heritage assets at 4, 5 and 6 Oaklea Passage  by reason of its siting, bulk, scale, mass and design.  This is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is contrary to Section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 130, 199, 202 and 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The application site is located in an area of archaeological interest - Kingston APA 2.2 Kingston Town, and has failed to provide an archaeological assessment to establish  if the development would adversely  affect a heritage asset of archaeological interest,  contrary to  Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and  the requirements of the NPPF (including  Section 16 and paragraphs 194,199-202, 190 and 197).",
    "The proposed development, due to its design, siting, height and mass, would have a detrimental impact upon the neighbouring dwellings as a result of loss of privacy, together with an increased sense of enclosure, overbearing impact and loss of openness and outlook,  contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, and lack of compliance with Council's waste and recycling policies to ensure appropriate waste collection arrangements, the proposed development would lead to highway safety concerns including inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.   As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012."
