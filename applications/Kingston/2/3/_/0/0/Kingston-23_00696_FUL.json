    "The proposal due to its design, provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents due to the substandard size of the internal accommodation necessary for a 1-bed, 2-person unit. As such the proposal fails to comply with Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13 Housing Quality and Mix of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13 Housing Quality and Mix of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012, owing to its failure to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height.",
    "The size of the proposed external amenity space for both the newly proposed unit and the existing dwellinghouse cannot be verified from the information submitted as part of the planning application. When measured from the scale provided on the plans, the external amenity areas would fall significantly below local minimum space standards for outdoor amenity space. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013."
