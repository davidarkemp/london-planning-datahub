    "The proposed development,  due to the bulk and massing to the rear  is considered  to over dominate the host building and detract  from the character of the area as seen from the rear gardens of neighbouring  houses,  presenting as an incongruous  and boxy addition. The proposal fails to comply with  Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 and policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, mass and siting, would appear overbearing and  result in the loss of openness and outlook  when viewed from 21 Kings Avenue, resulting in material harm to the living conditions of their occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "It has not been demonstrated  that a car free development can be accommodated within  the street without  having an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions including  on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets, and road safety issues in the surrounding highway network. As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012, and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed development due to its siting adjacent existing windows within the flank wall of the  host property would result in the loss of outlook to habitable  rooms and the  loss of the third bedroom, and as a consequence the loss of family sized accommodation, which is a form of accommodation  for which there is a known need within the borough. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy  DM10 and DM13 of the Core Strategy, 2012."
