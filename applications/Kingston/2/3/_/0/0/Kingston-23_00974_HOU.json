    "The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting and design in particular its proximity to the side boundary would create a dominant and overbearing addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring properties eroding the spaciousness of the plot and create an increased sense of enclosure to the rear of the properties in particular 125 South Lane and reduce the outlook of neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in a loss of daylight/sunlight to the neighbouring occupiers in particular 125 South Lane that would be to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013.",
    "The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would not be a subordinate addition to the host property and would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties to which it forms part of and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013."
