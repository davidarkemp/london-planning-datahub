    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses, such as lower cost and affordable workspace. The net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies E1 and SD9 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed accommodation would be of a substandard nature and would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards for a studio flat and for a 1-bedroom, 2-person arranged over two levels as set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "There is no technical Daylight and Sunlight Report to demonstrate adequate daylight and sunlight levels to the proposed accommodation, especially the proposed basement level flat to the main building. As such, the proposal is considered to represent poor quality internal accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "No private or communal external amenity space is provided, contrary to the criteria set out for new dwellinghouses in the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013, Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed refuse and recycling storage, specifically in terms of its siting, is considered to be inadequate to properly serve the development and could result in the inconsiderate disposal or storage of waste and recycling materials in the vicinity of neighbours, or on the street which would harm the character of the area, and potentially result in harm to highways/pedestrian safety, contrary to Policy DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "A Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to submit a Unilateral Undertaking to prevent future occupiers from applying for residents parking permits in the event of a future CPZ, and so the proposal has the potential to generate unacceptable highways congestion and safety concerns. As such, the proposal in this respect is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 (Adopted April 2012).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide a good standard of living accommodation in respect of the unit to the outbuilding in terms of poor outlook and compromised privacy by virtue of its relationship with the main building and the proposed siting and routing for residents to access waste storage receptacles. The proposal would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021."
