    "The proposed development by virtue of its size,siting and design would not be in keeping with the general pattern of development in the area and would erode the open character of this part of the estate which serves to provide a visual break and relief from and soften the built form of the estate and the development proposed would create an incongruous addition that would be a dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive addition to the streetscene, create visual clutter and would appear a cramped form of development that would detract from the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would erode the open vista in front of 17 - 27 Angus Close creating an unnecessary sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the neighbouring occupiers causing undue demonstrable harm to the residential amenities and existing living condition of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposed development would not be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Startegy.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design will result in the loss of a number of trees which serve to provide a soft verdant visual relief in the built form of the estate and their loss would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area detracting from the character and appearance of the streetscene. The proposal would not be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting and design would result in the loss of parking spaces in the estate and coupled with the increased demand for parking created by the proposed development the loss is likely to give rise to increased demand for on street parking and exacerbate existing on street parking pressures and lead to congestion and prejudice highway safety. The proposed development would not be in accordance with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The porposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would have substandard separation distance between the proposed properties and the existing neighbouring properties resulting in adverse mutual overlooking of habital room windows and private amenity space to the detriment of existing and future living conditions of neighbouring occupiers and the occupiers of the proposed development. The proposed development would not be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 ogf the Council's adopted Core Strategy and the Council's Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of the size, siting and design of the boundary treatment creates an unnecessary sense  of enclosure to the side and rear of the proposed development along the access paths to the neighbouring properties which  would create a hostile environment and a number of blind spots that could give rise to the risk of anti-social behaviour and crime putting at risk the safety of local residents and their visitors. The proposed development would not be in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy."
