    "The siting of new windows along the shared boundary with No. 53 Elmbridge Avenue would be unneighbourly and would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy and light spill to this neighbour. Furthermore, the introduction of potential habitable room windows along the boundary could also unduly impact the ability of the neighbouring property to extend their property, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
