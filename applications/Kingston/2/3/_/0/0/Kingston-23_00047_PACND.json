Therefore, the building does not benefit from the rights afforded by Schedule 2, Part 20, Class ZA1 (h) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Based on the information provided, part of the exterior wall of the new building nearest to a highway is nearer to the highway than the part nearest the highway of the exterior wall nearest the highway of the old building. Therefore, the building does not benefit from the rights afforded by Schedule 2, Part 20, Class ZA1 (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to preclude future occupiers of the development from accessing any future CPZ permits, it has not been demonstrated that the development would not adversely impact on street parking stress or avoid an unacceptable adverse impact on highway safety, contrary to policies DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "Given the separation distance of single aspect habitable room windows to the northern boundary of the site which would result in poor outlook, and lack of adequate private or communal amenity space, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would provide adequate levels of amenity for future occupiers of the development, contrary to London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design SPD."
