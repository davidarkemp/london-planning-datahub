    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows inserted at first floor level or above in the western flank/west facing roof slope shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. The windows shall thereafter be retained as obscurely glazed/non-opening.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
