    "The excessive scale, specifically in terms of its combined width and depth, and siting abutting the shared boundary with No. 11, of the proposed single storey rear extension, would represent an unsatisfactory form of development that would be excessive in scale and out of keeping with the surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013, specifically within Policy Guidance 33.",
    "Due to the siting and excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension (6m) along the shared boundary with No. 11 Cedarcroft Road, it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No. 11 Cedarcroft Road by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of outlook and an undue sense of enclosure, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013."
