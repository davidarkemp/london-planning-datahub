    "The proposed part single part two storey rear extension in conjunction with the proposed rear dormer roof extension due to the proposed siting, mass and bulk, design and materials (zinc cladding) would appear as a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling. It would result in a jarring and incongruous appearance which would have an unacceptable impact on the immediate surrounding area. Given the above the proposal is in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 34 and 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r",
    "Given the small separation distances on relatively narrow and small plots, it is considered that the proposed development due to the proposed mass and bulk would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining property No 4 Brough Close in terms of an overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure. As such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
