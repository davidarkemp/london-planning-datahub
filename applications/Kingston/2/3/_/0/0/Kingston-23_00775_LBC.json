Any bricks to be removed must be cut out by hand. Any replacement bricks must be fully tied into the wall following the original bond.\rThe mortar to be used in the development to which this consent relates shall be lime-based and shall match that of the original wall in terms of the coarseness of the aggregate, overall consistency, and finished colour, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To prevent harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, in accordance with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r",
