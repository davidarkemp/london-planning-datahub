    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of sufficiently detailed information, officers cannot be certain that the proposed development would not result in harm to protected trees, contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The siting of the proposed refuse and recycling facilities to the front of the building would result in harm to the outlook and amenity afforded the ground floor flat (i.e. Unit 2), particularly in terms of the potential for increased noise disturbance and odours in close proximity to the habitable room windows of this flat.  In this way, the proposals are contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The proposed cycle storage is considered to be impractical in terms of its siting and would not afford residents ease of access or promote sustainable forms of transport. The proposed cycle store is likely to result in the displacement of one existing car parking space, contributing to local highways congestion/on-street parking pressures. In this way, the proposals are contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and Policies DM09 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012."
