    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 358 Kingston Road in terms of daylight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development could breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupants of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed extension by virtue of its height and depth and siting on the common boundary with No.358 would appear overbearing, resulting in an undue sense of enclosure for the occupants of this dwelling. As such, the proposal is contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
