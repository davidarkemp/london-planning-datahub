    "The proposed development would by virtue of its siting and scale, create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed terrace and the privacy screens, by reason of its scale and siting would be unneighbourly and would appear overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of these properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
