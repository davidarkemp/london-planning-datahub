    "The proposed extension by reason of its excessive bulk and depth would be overly prominent and incongruous and would not relate well to the main dwelling or the adjacent properties. The proposal would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 & HC1 of the London Plan 2021, the NPPF (2021) and Policies CS8, DM10 & DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Due to its excessive depth along the shared boundary, the proposed extension would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the principle window of the nearest first floor habitable room at No. 21 Westfield Road, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
