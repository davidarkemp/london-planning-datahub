    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring gardens and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed extension by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and narrow their outlook to detriment of their existing living conditions. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
