    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses, such as lower cost and affordable workspace. The net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies E1 and SD9 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed accommodation would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of internal floor space and built in storage space for two-storey 3-bed, 4-person units as set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is not provided with any cycle storage, to serve the new development, contrary to Policy D3 and Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
