    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision. \r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990 (As amended)\r",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021. \r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby approved 3 swift bricks or boxes shall have been incorporated within the external walls of the development hereby approved and shall be retained thereafter. Swift bricks/boxes can be placed on any elevation, but ideally under shade-casting eaves. They should be installed in groups of at least three, at a height above 5m height, and preferably with a 5m clearance between the host building and other buildings or obstructions. Where possible avoid siting them above windows or doors. Swift bricks should be used unless these are not practical due to the nature of construction, in which case alternative designs of suitable swift boxes should be provided in their place. \r\rReason: To enhance the biodiversity of the site and to comply with Policy DM6 of the RBK Core Strategy and Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the first floor side evelation window serving the 'toilet' and any new or replacement windows in the side elevation to the first floor (serving a bathroom) of the dwelling shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
