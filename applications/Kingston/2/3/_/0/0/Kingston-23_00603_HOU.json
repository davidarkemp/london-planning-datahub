    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Strategy Plan 153GR-PL-06 hereby approved and and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of Fire Safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The development hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary to the residential use of the dwelling house, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, privacy screening at a height of 1.7m as measured from the ground level adjacent to the screen and erected along the south elevation of the hereby approved raised patio area shall be submitted and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved plans and permanently retained thereafter. \r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r"
