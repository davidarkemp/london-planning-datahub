    "The Fire Risk Assessment does not include all of the relevant details to satisfy policy D12 of the London Plan (2021) and only includes generic basic information with inadequate details, specific to the site/development.

A statement of competence has also not been provided. Furthermore, fire risk issues were identified through the Fire Risk Assessment and it is not clear that these have been addressed.\r\rIt therefore does not demonstrate that the development would be safe for its lifetime and, as such, this condition cannot be discharged.\r\r",
