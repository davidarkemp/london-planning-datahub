    "The proposed second floor extension, by reasons of its design, materials and siting above the existing side extension, results in a disjointed roof profile that fails to preserve or enhance the significance of the existing building and Richmond Road Conservation Area, resulting in less than substantial harm to the Conservation Area. In the absence of any public benefits that would outweigh this harm, the proposal is in conflict with Policy D3, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013)."
