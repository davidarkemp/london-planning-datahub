    "The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would appear visually intrusive and overly dominant within the street scene resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, the NPPF (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest principal habitable room windows at No. 40 and No. 44 Rollesby Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. The proposal would have an overbearing impact on the gardens of the adjoining properties. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
