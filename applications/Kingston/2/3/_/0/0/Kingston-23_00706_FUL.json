The Proposal would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed buidings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 193 to 202 of the  NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames Core Strategy 2012.",

The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

As such the proposal would not accord with policies DM5, CS8 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
