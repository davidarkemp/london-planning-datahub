    "The proposed crossover would be located with 6m of a mature street tree. The proposed ground works have the real potential to disturb and damage the roots of the trees and thereby potential causing harm / irreparable damage. No evidence has been submitted with the application to demonstrate that the works could be carried out without harming the tree. The loss of the tree would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area as well as the biodiversity value of the site. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DM 6 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed crossover would result in the loss of a significant amount of green verge. The loss of the grass verge would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area as well as the biodiversity value of the site. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DM 6 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed crossover would be located in close proximity to the roundabout / junction and the raised crossing table. The movements in to and out of the site would give rise to highway safety concerns especially given that vehicles would not be able to access and egress the site in a forward gear. The development is therefore contrary to Policy DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development would result in the removal of the front garden area and its replacement with hardstanding. The removal of the garden area would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area as well as the biodiversity value of the site. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DM 6 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy."
