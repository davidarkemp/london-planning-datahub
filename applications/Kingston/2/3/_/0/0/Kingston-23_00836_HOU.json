    "The proposed gable end extension would significantly unbalance the pair of prominent semi-detached properties, by increasing its visual bulk when viewed from the street, resulting in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse andless than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. In this way, the proposal is contrary to Paragraph 202 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS8 and Policy DM12 of the Core Strategy 2012 and Paragraph 4.29 of the Residential Design SPD 2013."
