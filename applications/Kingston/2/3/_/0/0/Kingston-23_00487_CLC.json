    "The applicant has not provided sufficient detail to determine whether the proposed waste and recycling details would satisfy the requirements of Condition 14 of the planning permission which is to ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed cycle parking would not be a secure and covered form of cycle parking and would not be of a character and appearance that would be sympathetic to its surroundings creating an incongruous feature that would create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Oakhill Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset. The proposal would not accord with paragraphs 194 - 202 of the NPPF 2021,  policies CS6, CS8, DM8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed cycle parking is insufficient as it provides fewer cycle parking spaces than the required 11 residents and 2 visitors cycle parking spaces required by policy T5 of the London Plan and therefore the proposed development would not accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r"
