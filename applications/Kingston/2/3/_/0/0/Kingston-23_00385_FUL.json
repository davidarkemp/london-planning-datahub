    "Hot food takeaways generally sell food that is high in calories, fat, salt and sugar, and low in fibre, fruit and vegetables. There is evidence that regular consumption of energy-dense food from hot food takeaways is associated with weight gain, and that takeaway food is appealing to children. It is recognised that the causes of obesity are complex and the result of a number of factors, and that a broad package of measures is required to reduce childhood obesity within London. A wide range of health experts recommend restricting the proliferation of hot food takeaways, particularly around schools, in order to help create a healthier food environment.\r\rThe proposed hot food take-away would be within 400 metres of Burlington Infant and Junior School. As such the proposed development would be in conflict with London Plan Policy E9 (Retail, markets and hot food takeaways) that states development proposals containing A5 hot food takeaway uses should not be permitted where these are within 400 metres walking distance from the entrances and exits of an existing or proposed primary or secondary school."
