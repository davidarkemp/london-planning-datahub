    "The proposed roof extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property in particular the part gable roof form that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and be visually intrusive in the streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013"
