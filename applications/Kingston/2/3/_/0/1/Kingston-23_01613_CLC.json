    "The information submitted in relation to Condition 5 (Privacy Screens to Flat 8) of planning permission 22/00597/FUL is considered to be insufficient to discharge this condition as the condition specifically requires obscure glazed screening, as no detailed drawings have been provided regardless and as the provision of metallic balustrades to the required height would likely appear bulky and result in a material change to the approved consent. It has therefore not been satisfactory demonstrated that the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers would be maintained, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
