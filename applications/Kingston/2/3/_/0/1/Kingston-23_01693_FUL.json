    "The proposal would not provide an adequate quantum of internal floorspace or privacy for all habitable rooms, would not be considered a wholly dual aspect dwelling with poor resultant outlook and natural daylight and sunlight ingress to the internal accommodation and, as such, it is considered that the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF 2021.",
    "Given that backland development is uncharacteristic of the form of the area and the proposal would divide the existing garden land, the proposal would appear visually out of keeping with the characteristic form of development within the immediate vicinity, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "Given the substantial separation distance of the proposed development from Somerset Avenue, and that the applicant has not provided sufficient details of waste collection, Officers are unable to assess the acceptability of waste arrangements to serve the proposed dwelling which could result in the proposal impeding upon pedestrian and highway safety and appearing a visual nuisance on collection day. This would be contrary to the NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that proposal would comply with flood policies in terms of providing an adequate escape route/evacuation plan in the event of a flood event, contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012."
