    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension by virtue of its size, mass and bulk and siting would constitute a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013."
