    "The proposed development would be a disproportionate addition to the existing building over and above its original size in the Green Belt and in particular to the side of the host property that would erode the visual break and visual relief in built form and, in turn, erode the openness of the Green Belt. The proposal therefore would not accord with Part 13 of the NPPF 2021, Policy G2 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM5 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed first floor extension by virtue of its size, siting and design to the side of the host property in close proximity of the side boundary and insufficient set back from the front building line would erode the spaciousness of the plot and be an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the street scene and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012, the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of it's size siting and design in close proximity to the side boundary would be a dominant and overbearing feature and create an unnecessary sense of enlosure  to the neighbouring occupiers of 402 Leatherhead Road. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
