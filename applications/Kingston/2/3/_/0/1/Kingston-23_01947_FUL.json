    "The proposed development of  the restricted backland site results in a poor design quality  and over development of the site as evidenced  by the site layout and floor plan configuration, which  presents a cramped, car dominated and unwelcoming environment for future residents contrary to Policies DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies D3 and D5 of the London Plan 2021 and National Planning Policy Guidance (particularly paragraphs 126,130 and 134).",
    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the designated heritage assets at 4, 5 and 6 Oaklea Passage  by reason of its siting, bulk, scale, mass and design.  This is not outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is contrary to Section 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 130, 199, 202 and 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The submitted Fire Strategy fails to demonstrate continuing emergency access for existing residents of Oaklea Passage and as such is contrary to Policy D12(A) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development, due to its design, siting, height  and mass, would have a detrimental impact upon the neighbouring dwellings as a result of loss of openness  and outlook and  increased sense of enclosure, contrary to Policy Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits and be provided with Car Club Membership, and  that refuse collections would be through private contractor, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that the ground floor void openings are kept unobstructed, the proposal could result in displacement of flood water and increase flood risk elsewhere contrary to Policies SI 12 and SI 13 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (July 2021), and National Planning Policy Guidance.",
    "The proposal provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents due to poor outlook,Â  lack of external amenity space for the studio units, limited separation from the boundaries andÂ  compromised access arrangements toÂ  bothÂ  the site and the residential entrance . As such the proposal fails to comply withÂ  Policies D3 andÂ  D6 of the London Plan 2021Â  and Policies DM10 and DM13Â  of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 16 of the RBK Residential Design SPD and National Planning Policy Guidance, Paragraph 130."
