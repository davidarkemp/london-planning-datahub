    "The scale, massing and appearance of the proposed two storey rear extension and the introduction of zinc roof and contrasting cladding that would emphasise the shape and form of the extension, would detract from the setting of the designated Grade-II listed building,  Malden Green Farmhouse and would result in less than substantial harm to its significance. As such the proposal is not considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. No public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 195 - 202 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8 and  DM12 of the Core Strategy 2012 ."
