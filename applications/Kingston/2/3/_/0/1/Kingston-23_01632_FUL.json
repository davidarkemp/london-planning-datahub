    "Proposed units 3 (2 bed) and 4 (1 bed) would not meet the minimum internal floor space standards set by Policy D6 Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has not provided an analysis of daylight/sunlight each of the units and therefore it has not fully demonstrated that the units and in particular unit 4 which is entirely single aspect, would achieve a sufficient level of daylight/sunlight for future occupants and would not result in a sub standard form of accommodation. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and DM 10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposal does not provide any amenity space private or communal and the applicant has not demonstrated that this would be at odds with the prevailing physical context and local character of development. The proposal therefore would not accord with Polices D6 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed extensions in particular the mansard roof by virtue its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and the terrace it forms part of and would not be of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and the adjoining terrace and sit comfortably alongside the host property and the terrace it forms part of. The proposed extension would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is dufficient local capacity on the highway network or a signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has not clearly provided the details of the amount of cycle parking that would be provided and has not demonstrated that the proposed cycle store could accommodate the required cycle parking provision that is required by Policy T5 Table 10.2 of the London Plan. In addition the location of the cycle store on the 1st floor accessed by a flight of stairs is not considered to be a practical solution for cycle parking on site. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies T5 of the London Plan and Policy DM8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
