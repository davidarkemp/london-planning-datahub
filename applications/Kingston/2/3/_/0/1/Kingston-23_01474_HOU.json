    "The proposed crossover would exceed the maximum width identified in the Vehicle Crossover Policy (April 2020) and it has not been demonstrated that sufficient visibility splays would be incorporated so as to ensure pedestrian and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 and the Council's Vehicle Crossover Policy (April 2020) and the NPPF (2021)."
