    "The removal of 40% of the height and volume of the crown would likely diminish the tree's health to some degree despite the resiliance of the species, and would certainly lessen it's visibility and therefore it's public amenity contribution for which it was protected. It would also mean the establishment of the same crown shape at a lower height which would do nothing to reduce the amount of work needed or the asociated cost of maintaining it, which was the quoted reason for the original application to fell the tree. The Council do not ever allow the removal of, or excessive works to, a high amenity value TPO tree in good health."
