    "Due to the finished floor levels being below the flood levels for the site (300mm above the 100-year + 35% climate change allowance), it has not been demonstrated that the flood risk to the site has been adequately addressed and managed to ensure that future users of the development would not be placed in danger from flood hazards throughout the lifetime of the development without leading to increased flood risk elsewhere. The proposal is therefore contrary to Environment Agency Standing Advice, Paragraph 166 of the NPPF (2021), Policies SI 12 and D11 of the London Plan (2021) and DM4 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed cycle and refuse stores, due to their scale and siting adjacent to the public highway, are considered to represent bulky, dominant, incongruous additions to the property that would result in harm to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The first floor single bedrooms to units 1 and 2 will receive relatively poor levels of outlook and Units 3, 4 and 5 will receive inadequate levels of private amenity space. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated through the submission of an Internal Daylight Assessment, which has been produced using the latest BRE guidance, that the proposed dwellings would receive sufficient levels of daylight. The proposal fails to provide a good standard of accommodation and is therefore contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "The proposed vehicular parking spaces fail to meet the minimum size standards set out in the RBK Sustainable Transport SPD and no mechanism has been secured to preclude residents from applying for on-street car parking permits in the Controlled Parking Zone, therefore it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not lead to parked vehicles oversailing and thus impeding movement along the public footway or result in inconsiderate parking and traffic congestion in surrounding roads and thereby have an unacceptable impact upon highway or pedestrian safety, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the Kingston Sustainable Transport SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that sufficient and adequately accessible cycle parking could be provided on site to accommodate the development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013."
