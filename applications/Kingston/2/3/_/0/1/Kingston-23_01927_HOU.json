    "In the absence of mitigation in the form of privacy screens, the raised patio would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy to neighbouring Oak Dell. Were the required privacy screens of a height of 1.7m to be installed, this would have an overbearing impact, result in an undue sense of enclosure and loss of daylight to the ground floor habitable room window at Oak Dell. Within this context, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is considered that the raised patio as built would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of Oak Dell, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Given the sites location within  a Critical Drainage Area and the identified surface water flood risk on site and neighbouring Oak Dell, along with approximately 108.6 sqm net increase in hard surfacing and ground level increases of approximately 1.4m and lack of any drainage details, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would not increase surface water flood risk on-site or elsewhere contrary to Policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted (2012)."
