    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance in particular its height would result in an incongruous addition to the area that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter that would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the setting of the designated and non designated heritage assets the Oakhill Conservation Area and a grouping of locally listed buildings 83 - 95 Ewell Road with a statutorily listed building in the midst of the grouping at its northern end 85 Ewell Road. \r\rThe proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance / special architectural integrity and historic interest of the heritage assets with the benefits of the proposal not outweighing the dis-benefits. \r\rThe proposal would not accord with section 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 208 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that they explored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building (whilst it is acknowledged that this is an upgrade of an existing facility, the upgrade would include a significant change in height and as such given the sensitive location in the setting of a conservation area and locally and statutorily listed buildings the application should demonstrate that less harmful locations have been assessed and reasonably discounted). \r"
