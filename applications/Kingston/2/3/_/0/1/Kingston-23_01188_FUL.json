    "The proposal fails to provide an appropriate mix of housing, providing eight one-bedroom units and no three bedroom dwellings, which is a form of accommodation for which there is a known need. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy DM13 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The proposal provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents which fails to comply with minimum space standards, and provides insufficient private amenity space and with no provision for communal amenity space.  As such the proposal fails to comply with  Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021  and Policies DM10 and DM13  of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 13 the RBK Residential Design SPD.",
    "The proposed development  due its height, design,  bulk and massing would be an discordant and incongruous development within the streetscene, which would over dominate the host buildings and detract  from the character of the area. The proposal fails to comply with  Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 and policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, mass and siting, would give rise to loss of daylight and privacy, and appear overbearing and  result in the loss of openness and  outlook when viewed from flats within 326 Hook Rise North, and from the garden of 82 Fuller Way North resulting  in material harm to the living conditions of their occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits were a controlled parking zone be introduced at a future date, it has not been demonstrated  that a car free development can be accommodated in this location without  having an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions including  on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets, and road safety issues in the surrounding highway network. As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012, and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD (2013)."
