    "The proposed parallel parking arrangement is of sub standard size, it would displace existing parking for residents of Scariff Court, and has the potential to cause potential safety issues. In the absence of cogent evidence or assessment, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that overspill car parking from the site would not adversely impact on-street car parking stress and highway safety, contrary to Policies DM8, DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021). As such the proposal fails Condition A.2(1)(a) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)..",
    "The proposed development, due to its siting, massing and design, would result in an inelegant and bulky addition which would detract from the appearance of the host building. The resulting building would appear visually intrusive and incongruous within the streetscene  and this part of the Local Area of Special Character, and would not be sympathetic to the local character or the surrounding built environment contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), and Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021). As such the proposal fails Condition A.2(1)(e) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed flats would comply with the nationally described space standard issued by the Department for Communities and Local Government on 27th March 2015, contrary to 3(9A), 'Permitted Development', of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its mass, siting and close proximity to boundaries would result in cumulative detrimental impact  in terms of loss of daylight, sunlight and overshadowing to the occupiers of 37 Sycamore Grove, and appear overbearing and  result in the loss of openness and outlook to the neighbouring occupiers of 37 and 43 Sycamore Grove. The impact would result in material harm to the living conditions of these neighbouring residential properties and their occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012. As such the proposal fails Condition A.2(1)(g) of Schedule 2, Part 20, Class A of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)."
