    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its width and siting and lack of separation distance from the shared boundary would reduce the characteristic gaps between the properties and adversely impact the openness of the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the immediate surrounding area, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
