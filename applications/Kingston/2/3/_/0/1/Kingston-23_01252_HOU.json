The proposals detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.",
    "By reason of height, depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of No. 28 and No. 32 Albert Road by reason of overbearing appearance, as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
