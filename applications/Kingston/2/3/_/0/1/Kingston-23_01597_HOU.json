    "The proposed extensions, by reason of scale, mass, height, design, proportions and materials, are considered to dominate and drastically alter the form, design and appearance of the existing building and result in a building of considerable scale, height and mass that would fail to respond positively to the character and appearance of the area, have a detrimental impact on the visual amenity of the Metropolitan Open Land and resulting in less than substantial harm to the Riverside North Conservation Area with no public benefits that would outweigh this harrm.  The proposal is therefore contrary to the NPPF (2021), Policies D3, G3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 5, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "In the absence of clear, accurate and consistent plans and arboricultural details, it has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the proposed devlopment would avoid unacceptable harm to existing trees or provide adequate replacement planting and landscaping, contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012."
