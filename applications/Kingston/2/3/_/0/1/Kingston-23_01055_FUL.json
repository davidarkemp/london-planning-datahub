    "The proposed accommodation would be of a substandard nature and fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of (single) bedroom sizes to Units 2 and 5, and built in storage space, as set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate private and communal amenity space below required space standards for new developments. The communal amenity space is also of a poor quality, in terms of siting and accessibility for future residents, contrary to Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Residential Design Guide SPD 2013, Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development is provided with inadequate refuse/recycling storage to serve the new development, specifically in terms of accessibility and transfer route to collection point, contrary to Policy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Residential Design Guide 2013.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would allow for adequate daylight/sunlight penetration to the neighbouring flats at No 25 Berrylands Road. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy Guidance 16 of the Residential Design Guide SPD, 2013 and Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By virtue of its siting and scale, the proposed development would have a materially detrimental effect on neighbouring amenity of those occupiers to the flats above No 25 Berrylands Road in terms of impact upon privacy, outlook, and visual dominance. As such, the proposal is considered to fail to comply with Policy Guidance 16 of the Residential Design Guide SPD 2013, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its height, bulk and appearance, as well as its siting within the plot is unacceptable and would be an incongruous form of development which would detract from the character and appearance of the existing site and the surrounding area, including the significance of the local area of special character. As such the proposals is considered to be contrary to Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies HC1, D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021)."
