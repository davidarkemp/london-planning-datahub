    "The proposed roof extensions by virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass and the proposed design would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would appear incongruous and it would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "The proposed roof extensions due to their siting, excessive scale, mass and bulk and design would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining property No 201 Malden Road. It would fail the BRE '45 degree rule' and therefore would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the nearest habitable opening at the first floor level at No 201. It would appear as overbearing and visually intrusive when viewed from the rear garden at No 201. As such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
