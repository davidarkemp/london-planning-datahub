    "The proposal would involve the unacceptable loss of a unit suitable for family accommodation of which there is a great need in the borough and as such the proposal would be conflict with policy DM14 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy",
    "The proposed 2 x 1 bed 2 person units would not meet the minimum internal floor space standards set in  Policy D6 Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has not provided an analysis of daylight/sunlight for each of the units and therefore it has not fully demonstrated that the units  would achieve a sufficient level of daylight/sunlight for future occupants and would not result in a sub standard form of accommodation. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed layout of the units is considered impractical and of a substandard nature and could give rise to noise transmission between units that could harm the living conditions of future occupants. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D6 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed decking by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not be a subordinate addition and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed decking would lead to increased overlooking of the rear gardens of the properties in Firman Close resulting in a loss of privacy to the neighbouring occupiers and as such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has provided no cycle parking provision within the scheme. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies T5 of the London Plan and Policy DM8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
