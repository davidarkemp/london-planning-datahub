    "The proposed two storey side extension, by virtue of its siting, excessive bulk, scale and mass would constitute a disproportionate addition failing to appear subordinate to the host property and would erode the visual separation between the application site and No.40 to an unacceptable degree. The proposed two storey side extension would therefore have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area conflicting with policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "Due to the submission of insufficient information and inaccurate block plan and site location plan, Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the residential amenities of neighbouring properties. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate, through the submission of accurate and consistent drawings, that the proposed two storey side extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the residential amenities of adjoining neighbouring properties in conflict with the Paragraph 124 of the NPPF (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) as well as Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
