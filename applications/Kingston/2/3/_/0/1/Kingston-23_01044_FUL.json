    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses, such as lower cost and affordable workspace. The net loss of employment capacity within Surbiton (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies E1 and SD9 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset of Oakhill Conservation Area and to the non-designated heritage asset of No. 160 Ewell Road, by reason of its siting and design.  This is not outweighed by any public benefit. In these regards, the proposal is not in keeping with the character and appearance of the area and is contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Paragraphs 130, 199, 202 and 206 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021.",
    "The double bedroom would be undersized at 9sqm against minimum space standards set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.",
    "The external amenity space at approximately 13sqm would represent a poor quality amenity area below space standards as set out by the Council. In this regard, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2021.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed internal living accommodation, specifically the bedroom and living room would be provided with poor outlook in close promimity to the rear boundary wall, contrary to the policy objectives of Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021.\r"
