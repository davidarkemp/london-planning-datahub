    "In the absence of cogent evidence it is considered that the net loss of retail employment floorspace would threaten the ongoing viability of the retail unit which, in turn, would threaten the predominance of retail uses in the vicinity and it has not been demonstrated that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses on the site, contrary to Policies DM17 and DM19 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse would be of a poor quality design which would be a discordant and more prominent feature than the development it would replace, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Surbiton Town Conservation Area. The proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, Policies DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "No legal agreement has been submitted to preclude residents of the development from applying for on-street car parking permits and it has not been demonstrated that any car parking associated with the site wouldn't exacerbate existing on-street car parking stress and lead to inconsiderate or illegal parking, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2023).\r",
    "The proposed dwelling would have poor levels of privacy and, in the absence of a Daylight & Sunlight Assessment being submitted to demonstrate to the contrary, it is considered that the position of the dwelling in relation to neighbouring properties is such that it would not achieve sufficient levels of daylight and sunlight. The proposed standard of accommodation would be poor, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "The proposed development would result in a significant loss of privacy to habitable room windows at Flats 22A and 22B Victoria Road and Nos. 1 and 2 Foundry Row and would likely result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to Nos. 1 and 2 Foundry Row, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "An insufficiently robust Fire Safety Strategy has been submitted to address the requirements of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021), including the requirement to demonstrate a suitably positioned unobstructed space for fire appliances. Accordingly, it has not been demonstrated that the development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021).\r"
