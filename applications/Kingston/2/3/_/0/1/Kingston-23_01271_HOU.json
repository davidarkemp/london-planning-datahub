Without proper justification, this is unacceptable, would harm the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and, and as such the proposal would conflict with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. Were any harm to occur to trees this would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the application site and wider Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, contrary to Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2012, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013."
