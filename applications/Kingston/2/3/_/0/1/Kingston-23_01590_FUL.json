The report shall assess the existing acoustic climate at the site and its potential to affect future occupants of the development. The following sources of noise and vibration shall be considered:\r\r- Condenser units\r\r- Any other plant proposed\r\rIf the assessment indicates that noise from these sources is likely to affect occupants, the report shall detail mitigation measures designed so that nuisance will not be caused to them.\r\rThe report shall be authored by a suitably qualified acoustic consultant/engineer and shall take into account the provisions of BS 8233:2014 \"Guidance on sound insulation and noise reduction for buildings\".\r\rThe approved mitigation measures shall be implemented prior to beneficial occupation of the development and be permanently retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for the occupants of the development, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThese details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and the details are likely to affect the design of other elements of the scheme."
