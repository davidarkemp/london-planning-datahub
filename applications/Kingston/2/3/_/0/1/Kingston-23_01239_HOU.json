    "The siting of new windows along the shared boundary with the properties on Park View would be unneighbourly and overbearing and would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy and light spill to these neighbour. Furthermore, the introduction of potential habitable room window towards No. 17 The Mount, could also unduly impact the ability of the neighbouring property to extend their property. The development would also have an overbearing impact to adjoining properties and it has not been demonstrated that there would not be a significant loss of light to adjoining properties, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013."
