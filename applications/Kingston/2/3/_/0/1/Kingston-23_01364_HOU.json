The proposal would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create a dominant and overbearing feature to the rear of the host property that would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring property 30 York Way to the detriment of the existing amenity of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Residential Design SPD."
