    "The proposed development would result in a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground floor habitable room windows at No. 8 and No.12 Leas Close. Furthermore, the excessive height, depth and siting of the extension in close proximity to the shared boundary with No. 8 Leas Close would result in an undue sense of enclosure and overbearing appearance in relation to No. 8 which would be exacerbated by the significant change in site levels between Nos. 8 and 10, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
