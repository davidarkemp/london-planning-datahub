    "The proposed development would by virtue of its siting and scale, create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed recessed balcony, by reason of its design and siting would result in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of neighbouring properties due to loss of privacy and perception of being overlooked. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
