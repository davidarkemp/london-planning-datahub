    "The proposed development, by reason of the increased roof ridge height and form and siting of the proposed side roof extension, would harm the appearance of the host dwellinghouse and appear as an incongruous feature within the Cherrywood Close street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and 'less than substantial' harm to the adjacent Liverpool Road Conservation Area.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraphs 130 and 202 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document."
