    "The proposed side extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design and proximity to the side boundary would create an incongruous addition that would erode the spaciousness of the plot to the side and erode the gap in the built form between the adjacent property 17 Glebe Gardens detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would in particular due to its depth and positioning along the side boundaries create a dominant and overbearing feature that would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties either side of the plot in particular that of the adjoining semi-detached property 11 Glebe Gardens. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF core Strategy April 2012 and Residential Design SPD 2013."
