    "The proposed development is inappropriate development in the Green Belt and would have an adverse impact on openness due to the materially larger development which would be of a discordant height, scale and design within the street scene. No Very Special Circumstances exist which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and other identified harms. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies DM5 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2023).\r"
