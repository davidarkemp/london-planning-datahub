    "The proposed 2nd floor unit would be laid out as a 3 bed 4 person unit and would not meet the minimum internal floorspace standard of London Plan Policy D6 and the applicant has not demonstrated that the unit would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for 75% of the habitable floorspace proposed and in addition both units would have impractical and deficient private amenity space. As such the proposal would provide a substandard level of accommodation in both units and conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS10 and DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD.\r",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations by virtue of their size, siting and design would be an incongruous addition to and would not be sympathetic to the host property causing visual clutter and intrusion in the private and public views of the site and they would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and fail to preserve or enhance the Park Road Conservation Area causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset. As such the proposal would be in conflict with the NPPF 2023 and Policies D3 & HC1of the London Plan 2021, and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed bin and cycle store would not cause noise and disturbance or loss of outlook to neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of their existing living conditions and as such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposal does not demonstrate that there would be sufficient provision of cycle parking for the future occupants of the proposed units. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would comply with the fire safety requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal does not provide sufficient off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network. As such, in the absence of any mitigation for the demand for on street parking being in place, the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
