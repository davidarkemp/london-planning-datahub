    "The proposal would involve the loss of trees of amenity value which are protected by Tree Preservation Order (TPO), including T7, a Category B Holm Oak . The loss of protected trees would harm the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character and there would be no public benefits which would outweigh the identified harm. Therefore, the proposals conflict with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, Policies D3, G7 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) and Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) ."
