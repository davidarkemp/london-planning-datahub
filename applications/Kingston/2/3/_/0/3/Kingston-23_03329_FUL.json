    "The proposed units would not meet the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and have an under provision of private amenity space without reasoned justification for not providing such space in accordance with LPA's Residential Design SPD. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the LPA's Residential Design SPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not be a subordinate addition and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed two storey extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers that would have a detrimental impact on the outlook of neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of their existing living conditions. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in the loss of daylight/sunlight to neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in the loss of daylight/sunlight to neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012..",
    "The proposed balcony would lead to increased overlooking of the rear gardens of the properties in George Road resulting in a loss of privacy to the neighbouring occupiers and as such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
