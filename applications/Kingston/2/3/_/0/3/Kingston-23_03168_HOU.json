    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Prior to work to repair the wall, a detailed landscape & planting plan showing replacement trees shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe plan shall include, where appropriate, a clear key or legend corresponding to the landscaping plan and providing the following information:\rSpecies (both Latin & Common names) for all plants.\rLocations of all plants or areas of planting.\rPlant numbers or planting densities.\rSizes of all plants and particularly trees 'at time of planting'.\rDetails of all hard-landscaping areas including materials \r\rThe approved scheme shall then be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced at the beginning of the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, samples of all new replacement copings and facing brickwork (including proposed brick types, size, colour, texture, face bond and pointing)  to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rAny existing bricks must be retained or re-used where possible. Any bricks to be removed must be cut out by hand. Any replacement bricks must be fully tied into the wall following the original bond.\r\rAll new work and improvements must match existing original adjacent work in terms of the choice of materials, method of construction and finished appearance. This applies unless differences are shown on the approved drawings or required in other conditions to this permission.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
