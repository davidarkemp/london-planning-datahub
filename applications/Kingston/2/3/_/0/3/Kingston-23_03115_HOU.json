    " By virtue of its siting the proposed vehicular crossover onto Leatherhead Road would be situated within 10 metres of a No.465 bus stop and bus cage. This close proximity could result in conflict between vehicles using the Leatherhead Road, which is likely to prejudice highway safety. The proposal would therefore not accord with the NPPF 2023, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy and the RBK Crossover Policy 2020.",
    "By reason of the excessive hard surface coverage, resulting in the removal of the characteristic grass verge to the front of the dwelling the proposed vehicle crossover would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the quality of the public realm and landscape within Leatherhead Road and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Crossover Policy 2020."
