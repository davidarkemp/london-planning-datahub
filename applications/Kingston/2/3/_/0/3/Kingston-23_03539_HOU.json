    "The proposed development would be incongruous, jarring and highly prominent when viewed from neighbouring properties and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the Southborough Conservation Area, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area and would result in less than substantial harm to the Southborough Conservation Area for which no public benefits have been identified that would outweigh this harm. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023).",
    "By reason of sitting, the proposed second-floor gable windows would result in unacceptable overlooking and a loss of privacy to the closest neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
