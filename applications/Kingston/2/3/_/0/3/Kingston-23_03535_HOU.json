    "By reason of depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 62 Worthington Road by reason of overbearing appearance and would lead to an unacceptable loss of daylight and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
