    "The proposed development would be appear bulky, disordered and incongruous in appearance which would also be highly prominent when viewed from neighbouring properties to the rear. The proposals are of a poor quality design and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2023.",
    "Due to the excessive width of the proposed vehicle crossover at the back of the footway, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety and the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
