    "An EIA is not required for the proposed development. \r\rWhilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would fall within table schedule 2 Column 1 3(a) Industrial installations for the production of electricity, steam and hot water (unless included in Schedule 1) of The Town and Country Planning (Environmental Impact Assessment) Regulations 2017 and would have a site area of more than 0.5 of a hectare. It would not fall within Schedule 1. The proposal would not trigger any significant effects outlined by schedule 3 of the regs and as such the proposal is not likely to have significant effects on the environment.\r\rNotwithstanding the above, given the Biodiversity interests of the site any future proposal must be supported by robust and detailed information with particular regards to protected species bats and great crested newts of which activity of these species has been recorded in the vicinity of the site and adjacent and nearby Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation (SNIC)."
