    "The proposed unit would not meet the minimum internal floorspace for a 1 bed 2 person two storey dwelling or the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and would have an impractical internal layout and compromised external private amenity space. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the LPA's Residential Design SPD and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that adequate sound insulation would be installed to prevent harmful noise transmission through walls and floors to avoid harmful noise pollution to neighbouring occupiers and the future occupants of the proposed development as result of the internal layout proposed.  The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed rear car parking space by virtue of its nature, siting and design would create an incongruous feature and visually detract from the character and amenity of the area. The proposal therefore would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed rear car parking space due to its siting and design is likely to give rise to noise and disturbance and light pollution to the neighbouring occupiers and as such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposal does not meet the minimum cycle parking provision required by Policy T5 of the London Plan and as such the proposal would not accord with  Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
