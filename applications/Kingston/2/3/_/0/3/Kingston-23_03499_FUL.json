    "The proposed unit would not meet the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and would have a layout that would compromise the living conditions of future occupants. The proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012  and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The applicant has not by way of any sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years demonstrated that there is no longer a need for the level of commercial floorspace on site or that a reduction in floorspace would not compromise the viability and therefore future prospects of the site being a continued viable commercial site. As such the proposal would not accords with policies E4, E7 of the London Plan 2021 and DM17 of the Council's Adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that any future commercial use would not conflict with the proposed residential use that would be proposed on site and in turn compromise both the viability of a commercial use on site or the residential amenities of the future occupants of the residential units contrary to Policy D13 (Agent of Change) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size siting and design, in particular the height,  in relation to the neighbouring properties would give rise to an unnecessary sense of enclosure and result in mutual overlooking of the private amenity space of the application site and that of 126-130 Ewell Road to the detriment of the privacy of the neighbouring occupiers and future occupiers of the development. As such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r",
    "The proposal is likely to give rise to increased demand for on street parking. The applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate their is local capacity on the highway or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. As such the proposal would not accord with policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The swept path analysis provided in support of the application appears to show swept path track that crosses into land outside of the control of the applicant as such officers are concerned that the proposed spaces may not be suitable to allow a cra to exit and enter the site onto the highway network in a forward gear which would prejudice the highway safety. As such the proposal would not accord with policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
