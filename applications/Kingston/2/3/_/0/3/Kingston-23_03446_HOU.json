    "The proposed change of material to the dormer would accentuate the poor and bulky design of the existing dormer making it a more prominent feature within the street scene that would make it visually intrusive and increase its incongruous appearance and detract further from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed development would not accord with policies CS8 and Dm10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
