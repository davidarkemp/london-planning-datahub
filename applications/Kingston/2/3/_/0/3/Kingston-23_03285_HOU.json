    "Due to the siting along the boundary and excessive depth and height of the proposed single storey side and rear extensions, it is considered to appear as overbearing when viewed from No 150 Hamilton Avenue. In the absence of any cogent evidence to the contrary it is considered that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" in relation to the closest habitable room window at No 150 Hamilton Avenue indicating that there would be a noticeable loss of daylight. As such, the proposal would result in unacceptable harm to the amenities of No. 150 contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed 'dummy' pitched roof form is considered to be out of character and not in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding properties. Altogether with the proposed fenestration, it would create unsatisfactory relationship with the main dwelling and would not relate well  the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
