    "The proposed development due to its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would not sit uncomfortably with the host property, erode the spaciousness of the plot and be a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive in the private views of the rear of the site from the neighbouring properties and in the public views from the street detracting from the character and appearance of the host property, the streetscene and surrounding area. As such the proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the site to the rear of the application site the New Malden Tennis Club and the site to the south 217 Malden Road to the detriment of the amenities, in particular the outlook of neighbouring occupiers at the adjacent residential properties. As such the proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would not be severe and as such the proposal would not accord with paragraph 115 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposal would not provide any cycle parking provision and as such would not accord with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and DM8 of the  Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would not prejudice future development at the neighbouring site the New Malden Tennis Club in particular the residential amenities of future occupants and as such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the  Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
