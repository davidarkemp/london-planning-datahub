    "Insufficient details of the proposed materials have been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed boundary treatment would be of a high quality so as to preserve the character and appearance of the Oakhill Conservation Area and the replacement of a brick wall with a timber fence would result in a loss of historic fabric. Were materials of a poor quality to be used this would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) and Section 72 of The Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended)."
