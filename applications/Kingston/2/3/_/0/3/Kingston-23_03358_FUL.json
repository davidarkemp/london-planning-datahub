    "The proposed unit would not meet the minimum floor to ceiling height of 2.5m set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.

    "The proposed subdivision of the plot would create a new narrow plot and a reduction in the width of the donor plot that would give the appearance of a cramped form of development and create an incongruous feature that would be at odds with the prevailing pattern and form of development/layout of the surrounding area detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would not accord with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
