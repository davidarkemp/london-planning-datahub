    "The layout of unit 2 with a bedroom window and the kitchen/living windows sited adjacent the communal bins and cycle store would give rise to noise and disturbance to future occupants of unit 2 to the detriment of their future living conditions and as such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The units' access arrangements across land on the adjacent property are likely to give rise to noise and disturbance and a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers and the future occupants of the proposed development and add to the substandard nature of the proposed accommodation. As such the proposal would therefore provide a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
