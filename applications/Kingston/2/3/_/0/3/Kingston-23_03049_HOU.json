    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension due to its prominent position and excessive scale would appear to be a dominant and disproportionate addition in relation to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Furthermore, the total enlargement by virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass would constitute a disproportionate addition. Due to its prominent position the proposal would result in an unacceptable visual impact on the street scene. The proposed development would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 34 and 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
