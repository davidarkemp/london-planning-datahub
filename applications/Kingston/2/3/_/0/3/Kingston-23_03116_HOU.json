    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed part single part two storey rear extension, front porch and the outbuilding would constitute a disproportionate and incongruous addition. Furthermore, the proposed collection of roof forms and fenestration would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Due to its visibility from Cardinal Avenue the proposed development would also result in an unacceptable visual impact on the street scene and the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character. The proposed development would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 202, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "Due to the excessive scale, mass and bulk of the proposed part single part two storey rear extension and the proposed outbuilding altogether, the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining properties by reason of overbearing appearance. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
