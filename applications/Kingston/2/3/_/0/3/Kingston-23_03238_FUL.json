    "The proposed development falls outside the scope of the description of development of planning permission ref: 22/02235/FUL and therefore cannot be considered as a minor material amendment to the original permission via Section 73 of The Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The proposed outbuilding by reason of its excessive depth and height would appear as a dominant and bulky structure. Its scale, mass and bulk would not be characteristic to the surrounding area and would fail to preserve the open character of the Southborough Conservation Area. In the absence of public benefits that would outweigh this harm, the proposal is in conflict with Policy D3, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).",
    "Due to the excessive depth and height of the outbuilding, it is considered that it would appear as an overly dominant structure when viewed from the adjoining properties Nos 57 and 53 Langley Avenue, harming residential amenity contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
