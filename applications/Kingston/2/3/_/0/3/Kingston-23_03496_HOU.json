    "Due to its scale, form, bulk, height, siting and design the proposed roof extensions, first floor side extension and balcony, as a whole would be an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed balcony would result in unacceptable overlooking and a loss of privacy to the closest neighbouring properties, and would result in noise and disturbance which is not common for suburban areas such as this, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
