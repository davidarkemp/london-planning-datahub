    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative demand for the use of site for employment purposes, or a range of alternative employment uses, such as lower cost and affordable workspace. The net loss of employment capacity within Surbiton (floorspace and/or land) on the site has not been justified and would be contrary to Policies CS12 and DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies E1 and SD9 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 81 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "The absence of built-in storage space would represent poor quality accommodation. In this regard, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13 Housing Quality and Mix of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012, owing to its failure to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height.",
    "The external amenity space at approximately 13sqm would represent a poor quality amenity area below space standards as set out by the Council. In this regard, the proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 and the National Planning Policy Framework 2023.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed internal living accommodation, specifically the living room would be provided with poor outlook in close proximity to the rear boundary wall, contrary to the policy objectives of Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021."
