    "The combined height and depth of the proposed extension, terrace and necessary privacy screens/boundary treatment would have an unacceptable overbearing impact and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining No. 42, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposals include a significant increase in hard surfacing and the application site and neighbouring properties are identified as being at low-medium risk of surface water flooding. In the absence of any drainage details, it is has not been demonstrated that the proposals would not increase flood risk on-site or elsewhere, contrary to Policy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraph 167 of the NPPF (2021).",
    "The combined height and depth of the proposed extension, terrace and necessary privacy screens/boundary treatment would result in a prominent, visually intrusive and incongruous development which would be highly visible from neighbouring properties which would harm the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021)."
