    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed vehicular crossover would not harm the health and longevity of the immediately adjacent street tree or require its removal. The removal or any harm to the street tree would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the quality of the public realm within Oak Hill Road and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2012, Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.",
    "Due to the excessive width of the proposed crossover vehicle at the back of the footway, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on highway safety, the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
