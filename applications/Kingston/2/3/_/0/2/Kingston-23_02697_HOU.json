    "The proposal due to its prominent position, excessive mass and bulk, the proposed uncharacteristic roof forms and insufficient set in distance from the common boundary with No 23 and the provision of a first floor balcony, when considered cumulatively, would constitute disproportionate and incongruous additions which would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area, in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 and 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r",
    "Due to the siting and depth of the proposed single storey rear extension there would be an unacceptable overbearing appearance to No. 23 Montem Road while the proposed first floor balcony/terrace area would create noise and disturbance and also a loss of privacy to the rear garden of No. 23, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2023, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
