    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the rear of the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings it forms part of and would be visually intrusive in the private and public views of the site from neighbouring properties and the public realm which would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted Residential Design SPD 2013."
