The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022), where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The development must be carried out in accordance with the provisions of the Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Method Statement by Tamla Tree Consulting Arborists dated June 2023 unless otherwise approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r"
