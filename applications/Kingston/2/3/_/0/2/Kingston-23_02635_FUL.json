    "The proposal would result in a significant loss of employment floorspace which has the potential to reduce the future viability and continued use of the site for employment purposes and it has not been demonstrated by sound evidence and rigorous marketing that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses, contrary to Policy DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policies E1 and E2 of the London Plan (2021).\r",
    "The second floor unit would be laid out as a 1 bed 2 person unit and would not meet the minimum internal floorspace standard of London Plan Policy D6. As such the proposal would conflict with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations would by virtue of their size, siting and design not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural design sympathetic to the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would be in conflict with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 andPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that all units would have an internal floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for 75% of the habitable floorspace in particular the accommodation in the roof space and as such has not demonstrated the proposal would not be of a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has not provided an analysis of daylight/sunlight for all of the units and therefore it has not fully demonstrated that all the units would achieve a sufficient level of daylight/sunlight for future occupants and would not result in a sub standard form of accommodation. As such the proposal would not accord with Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. \r",
    "The proposal would be deficient in its provision of amenity space across the 3 units proposed and as such would conflict with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would comply with the fire safety requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network. As such, in the absence of any mitigation for the demand for on street parking being in place, the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2023, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
