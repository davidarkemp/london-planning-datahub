    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter that would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The LPA is not satisfied that the applicant has fully considered alternative sites or that the application site represents the least harmful option available in the area to meet the additional coverage and capacity requirements. As such, the proposal is contrary to paragraph 117 of the NPPF 2023."
