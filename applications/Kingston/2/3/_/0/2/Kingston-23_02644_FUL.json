    "The proposed development is of a poor design and would appear cramped and contrived. The siting of the development along the eastern boundary of the site would erode the visual amenities of the adjoining Elmbridge Open Space. The harm to the character and appearance of the site and the wider area would be contrary to Policies DM5 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Paragraphs 131 and 135 of the NPPF (2023) and Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).\r",
    "The development results in a significant loss of communal amenity space within the site for residents of Perak Court and would inconvenience residents by increasing walking distances to the bin store. The proposals diminish the amenities and opportunities for social interaction for residents of Perak Court.  The development would also result in a loss of privacy to habitable room windows and the rear garden of No. 2 Elmbridge Avenue. The proposals conflict with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies D3 and D5B(2) of the London Plan (2021) and Paragraph 135 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "In the absence of any technical ecological assessments it has not been demonstrated that the development would not adversely impact protected species and their habitats within the adjoining Elmbridge Meadows Local Nature Reserve/Site of Importance for Nature Conservation, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6 and  DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017).",
    "Insufficient information, including details of suitable access and equipment for firefighting, has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021).",
    "The proposed flats would not  achieve the minimum 2.5m floor to ceiling height, would not have any private amenity space and would have an excessive travel distance to waste and recycling stores which results in a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and the Council's Recycling & Waste Technical Planning Guidance (April 2021).\r"
