    "The proposed single storey rear extension has not been consistently shown on the submitted drawings. In the absence of any cogent evidence to the contrary and given the proximity of the extension to the site boundary, the potential depth and height, alongwith the relatively narrow width of plot at adjoining No. 38, it is considered that the extension would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of No. 38 Willow Road by way of overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure, contrary to Paragraph 124 of the NPPF (2023), Policies D3 of the London Plan (2021) and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r"
