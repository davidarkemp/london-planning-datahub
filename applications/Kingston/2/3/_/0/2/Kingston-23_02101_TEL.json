    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter that would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset (the St Andrew's Square Conservation Area). The proposal would fail to preserve or enhance character and appearance of the Conservation Area. The benefits of the proposal would not outweigh the disbenefits of the proposal. The proposal would not accord with paragraphs 189 - 208 of the NPPF 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The LPA is not satisfied that the applicant has fully considered alternative sites or that the application site represents the least harmful option available in the area to meet the additional coverage and capacity requirements. As such, the proposal is contrary to paragraph 117 of the NPPF 2021."
