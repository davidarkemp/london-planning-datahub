The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design is likely to give rise to a significant loss of daylight/sunlight and the applicant has not demonstrated that any loss of daylight/sunlight to the neighbouring occupiers would not have a detrimental impact on the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013."
