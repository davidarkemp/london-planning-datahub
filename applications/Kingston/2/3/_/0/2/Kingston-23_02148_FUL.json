    "The proposal would result in the loss of employment land and premises and a retail employment use and the application is not supported by any sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that demonstrates there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses at the site and/or that a retail use is no longer viable on the site. As such the proposal would be in conflict with policies DM17 and DM19 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations would by virtue of their size, siting and design not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural design sympathetic to the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such the proposal would be in conflict with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 andPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that all units would have an internal floor to ceiling height of 2.5m for 75% of the habitable floorspace in particular the accommodation in the roof space and as such has not demonstrated the proposal would not be of a substandard level of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The applicant has not provided an analysis of daylight/sunlight for each of the units and therefore it has not fully demonstrated that the units would achieve a sufficient level of daylight/sunlight for future occupants and would not result in a sub standard form of accommodation. As such the proposal would not accord with Policies DM10, DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposal would be deficient in its provision of amenity space across the 3 units proposed and as such would conflict with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r",
    "The proposed development would result in mutual overlooking within the site between the units proposed and overlooking from neighbouring properties of habitable room windows that would result in a loss of privacy for future occupants of the units. As such the proposal would conflict with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed first floor rear built form and windows of the proposed 4 bed unit would by virtue of its size, siting and design and proximity to the boundary and window placement create an overbearing feature and result in a loss of privacy to the neighbouring occupiers in Elm Road and Albany Road. As such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would comply with the fire safety requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021",
    "The proposal does not provide off street parking and the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network. As such in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2023 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant has provided no cycle parking provision within the scheme. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies T5 of the London Plan and Policy DM8 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
