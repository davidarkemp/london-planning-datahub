    "The proposed roof extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property creating a visual intrusion in the streetscene and the private views of the site from neighbouring properties and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed development therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy 2012, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and the RBK Residential Design SPD 2013."
