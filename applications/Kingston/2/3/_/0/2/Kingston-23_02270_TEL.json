    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, causing harm to the non designated heritage asset (the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character). The benefits of the proposal would not outweigh the disbenefits of the proposal. The proposal would not accord with the NPPF 2023 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.\r",
    "The LPA is not satisfied that the applicant has fully considered alternative sites or that the application site represents the least harmful option available in the area to meet the additional coverage and capacity requirements. As such, the proposal is contrary to paragraph 117 of the NPPF 2023."
