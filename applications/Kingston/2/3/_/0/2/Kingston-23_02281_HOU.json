    "The proposed front boundary treatment by reason of its scale and height would be out of character with the streetscene and the surrounding area, including less than substantial harm to the non-designated heritage asset of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character within which the site falls and result in less than substantial harm to the setting of the adjacent Liverpool Road Conservation Area, a designated heritage asset. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy, Policy Guidance 44 of the Kingston Residential Design SPD 2013 and Paragraphs 202 and 203 of the NPPF, 2023."
