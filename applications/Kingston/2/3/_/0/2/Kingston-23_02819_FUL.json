    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI 7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, a delivery and service plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved plan.\r\rReason: To ensure proper delivery and service management in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Before the use hereby permitted commences a report shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority demonstrating that the recommended works as described in para 5.3 of the DAA Group Noise Impact Assessment: The Fountain, 120 Malden Road, New Malden, KT3 6DD Issue 01 dated 11th October 2023, submitted as part of this application have been undertaken. The appproved and implemented works shall be retained in perpetuity.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D14 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThese details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and the details are likely to affect the design of other elements of the scheme.",
    "The use to which this permission hereby relates shall be implemented and thereafter operated/maintained as such in accordance with the deposited fire startegy plan. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The Gym use use class E(d) to which this permission relates shall not open outside of the following hours:\r09.30 - 09.30pm Monday to Friday\r09.30 - 09.30pm on Saturdays\r09.30 - 09.30pm on Sundays and bank holidays\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
