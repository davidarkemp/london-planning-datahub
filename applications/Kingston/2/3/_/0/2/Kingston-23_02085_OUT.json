    "The proposed building, by reason of the building's combined height and siting in relation to the rear facing windows of the ground floor flat at No. 36 Tolworth Rise South, is considered to result in undue levels of overlooking and sense of enclosure to the occupiers of this neighbouring property, contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy and the NPPF (2021).",
    "By reason of the siting of the proposed building, and in the absence of a detailed daylight and sunlight assessment, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would avoid an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to the ground floor flat of No. 36 Tolworth Rise South. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy and the NPPF (2021).",
    "The proposal, by reason of inadequate GIA floorspace, poor outlook and privacy to the principal habitable rooms, poorly sited windows and lack of private amenity space, is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposed unit, would be served by adequate levels of daylight and sunlight, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "(The proposed level of off street parking falls short of the London Plan maximum parking standards and it has not been demonstrated through a Transport Statement and Parking Survey that the proposal would avoid an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions, highway safety and the surrounding highway network, contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2021), Policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
