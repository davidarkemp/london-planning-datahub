As such the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would not be severe.As such the proposal would not accord with the NPPF 2023 and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r",
