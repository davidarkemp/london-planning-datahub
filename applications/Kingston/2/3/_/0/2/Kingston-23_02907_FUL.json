    "The proposed development by virtue of its, size, siting and design would not be of an architectural style or subordinate addition to the host property and would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property, the group value of the buildings it sits alongside and the surrounding area causing harm to the non designated heritage asset Thames-Side Strategic Area of Special Character. As such the proposal would not accord with paras 189 - 208 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design and its proximity to neighbouring habitable room windows and amenity space would create a dominante feature that would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure and result in actual or perceived overlooking and a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of their existing living conditions. As such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted LDF Core Startegy April 2012. \r"
