    "By virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass and its siting as well as thejumbled mix of roof forms which are not characteristic to the area,  when considered cumulatively, the proposal would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. It would adversely affect the symmetry of the adjoining dwellings and the open character of the area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 34 and 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013)."
