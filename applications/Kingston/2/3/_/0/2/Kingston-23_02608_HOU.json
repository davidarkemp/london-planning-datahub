    "By reason of its uncharacteristic roof form, the proposed hip to gable roof extension would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, it would disturb the symmetry of the existing roof extensions at the adjoining properties  resulting in a jarring and incongruous appearance which would have an unacceptable impact on the existing  street scene. Furthermore, the proposed rear dormer roof extension due to its excessive scale, bulk and mass and contrived design would constitute a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Given the above the proposed development is in conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD."
