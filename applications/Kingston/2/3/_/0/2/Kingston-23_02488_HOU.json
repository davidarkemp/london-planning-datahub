    "The proposed development would be disproportionate in scale, incongruous and jarring when viewed within the street scene and from neighbouring properties and would create a terracing effect. The proposals would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider Strategic area of special character, causing harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and wider area. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2023)."
