    "The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its depth added to its height along the party wall boundary of 10 Hardman Road would create a dominant and overbearing feature that would create in turn an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers to the detriment of the existing living conditions of those neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013.",
    "The proposed extension would be likely to result in a loss of light to the neighbouring occupiers at 10 Hardman Road by reason of its depth added to the height of the proposed extension and its proximity to the boundary which would be detrimental to the neighbouring occupiers and the applicant has not submitted any evidence to the contrary. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 off the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD 2013."
