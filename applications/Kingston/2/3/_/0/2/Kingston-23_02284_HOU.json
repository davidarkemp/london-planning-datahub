The proposed first floor side extension would reduce the characteristic gaps between the properties and adversely impact the openness of the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the cumulative impact of the proposed side extensions would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r"
