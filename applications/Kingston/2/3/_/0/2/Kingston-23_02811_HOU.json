    "Due to its siting, scale, depth and height along the boundary the retrospective outbuilding is an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "By reason of height, depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of No. 15 Romney Road by reason of overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure, as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2023, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
