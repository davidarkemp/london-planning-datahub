The proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character, appearance and setting  of the host building  no26 ( a non designated heritage asset) and the immediate neighbouring property no24 Church Road (non designated assets) and would result in an less that substantial harm to the designated heritage asset of Old Malden Area B Conservation Area thereby conflicting with NPPF (2023), Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM10 and DM12 of the RBK LDF Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
