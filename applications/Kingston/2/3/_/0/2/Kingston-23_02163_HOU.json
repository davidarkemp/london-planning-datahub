    "The proposed roof extension by virtue of its size, siting and design and in particular the steepness of its roof pitch would create an incongruous and dominant addition to the host property that would not sit comfortably with the proportions of the existing built form of the host property, the adjoining semi-detached property and that of the surrounding properties. As a result it would be visually intrusive in the street scene detracting from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and the Residential Design SPD 2013."
