    "The proposed use is considered to fall within the London Plan definition of large-scale shared living. It has not been adequately demonstrated that the proposal would be designed to function and operate in accordance with the various requirements of Policy H16 of  London Plan 2021.",
    "It has not been adequately demonstrated that the proposal would provide an adequate standard of internal communal facilities such as kitchens and dining spaces and other communal amenity facilities in line with London Plan Policy H16.",
    "The applicant has failed to justify through the submission of a financial viability appraisal that the proposal cannot contribute towards affordable housing. The proposal would be contrary to Policy H16 of  London Plan 2021.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of its height, mass, bulk , design and architectural treatment would appear dominant, overbearing that would overwhelm the site and appear as a contrived and incongruous feature within the street scene. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF 2023, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "It has not been robustly demonstrated that the proposed use of the site as a large-scale living accommodation would be compatible with residential character of the area and not result in a significant loss of privacy, noise and disturbance for neighbouring residential properties particularly from the use of the amenity areas including the roof terrace. The proposal would result in significant increased overlooking into neighbouring properties and gardens. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2023) and Policy DM10 Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The drainage strategy does not demonstrably follow the drainage hierarchy of London Plan Policy SI 13 and no suitable justification has been provided for discounting infiltration. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF 2023 and Policy S1 13 of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The submitted EcIA does not conform to CIEEM guidance including the  omissions of local SINCs in the desk-based survey, conclusions on impacts on protected species (inc bats and badgers) and the absence of detail informing the BNG calculations. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF 2023, Policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy Dm6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to submit a robust Fire Statement that adequately addresses all  the requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). It has therefore  not been demonstrated that the proposed development would achieve the  highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan  (2021).",
    "No mechanism has been provided to preclude residents from applying for car parking permits within any such designated zone or to secure Car Club membership for residents. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF (2023), Policies T4 & T6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "No mechanism to secure the required net-zero carbon offsetting payment  has been submitted. The proposal would be contrary to Policy SI 2 of the  London Plan (2021) and Policy DM3 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy  (2012)."
