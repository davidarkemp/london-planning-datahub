    "The proposed extension and total enlargement would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed development would therefore not fall within the parameters of Class A.1 (j) (iii) and (ja) of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the proposed exterior materials would be similar in appearance to those used in the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. The works would not comply with Condition A.3 (a) of Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
