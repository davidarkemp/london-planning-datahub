    "Consultations\r6no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No comments received.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of existing conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe site comprises of a detached two-storey dwelling located in Tangmere Grove.  \r\rThe site does not comprise of a listed building, nor is it located within a conservation area or local area of special character. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rCouncil's Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for single-storey rear extensions (under Policy Guidance 33), as follows:\rDepth: \r-\tIf the neighbouring house is set at a lower level, the depth of the extension should be reduced. \r-\tIf the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r-\tIn all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain. (Rear extensions to houses with very small gardens will be assessed on their individual merits.) \r-\tExtensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth.\r\rHeight:\r-\tExtensions proposed with: \r-\ta flat roof should not exceed 3m in height; \r-\ta parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height; \r-\ta pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height; and, \r-\ta balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe design of the extension is simple with a flat roof and 3no. flat rooflights inset. The proposed rear extension would extend most of the width of the dwelling. The depth of the proposed rear extension would measure to 4m, to a height of 3.3m. \r\rWhilst officers recognise that the depth would not adhere to Council's guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, the scale in context of its plot and the relationship to neighbouring properties is considered to be acceptable in this particular instance. \r\rThe proposals are assessed as generally in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development, would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rThe proposal is considered in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be proportionate to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representations has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Flank wall to be constructed of fair faced brick work in pale colour. \rOfficer response: The above concerns will be addressed within the report.\r\rRelevant Plannign History\r23/00990/CPU Erection of single storey side/rear extension granted on 06.06.2023\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would project approximately 2.85m beyond the existing outrigger line and the infill element of the proposal would be approximately 6m deep. It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth which is up to 3.5m. However, given that the extension would be to the rear only and would not be visible within the streetscene it is considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective. With regards to the proposed materials - painted render, it would be similar to the existing one and therefore acceptable.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Based on the submitted information the proposed extension would fail the 45 degree rule in relation to the closest ground floor habitable opening at the adjoining property No 46 Mount Road resulting in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. \r\rFurthermore, due to the proposed depth of the infill extension of approximately 6m along the site boundary at a height of 3m, the proposal would appear overbearing and would result in an undue sense of enclosure in relation to No 46. Officers note the certificate of lawfulness granted for 3m extension ref no 23/00990/CPU, however the current proposal is considered to have a materially greater impact then the lawful development certificate given the significant increase in size proposed by the planning application proposal.\r\rWith regards to No 42 Mount Road, given the siting and scale of the proposal it is considered not to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans.

Roof alteration. \r\rThe applicant is reminded that implementing this development in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful.

    "Consultations\r6no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\r23/00444/HOU - Conversion of garage to habitable accommodation following a single storey front extension including new porch. Installation of new front door and side rooflight, and changes to fenestration. Refused planning permission, dated 20.04.2023 for the following reason:\r\r(1)\tDue to the excessive projection at the front, the proposed extension would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 38 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the conversion of the existing garage to habitable accommodation with changes to front and side fenestrations. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on Elgar Avenue.\r\rThe site is not subject to any particular land use designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r-\tThe Impact upon Highways; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals seek to convert the integral garage into a habitable space with associated change from existing garage door to a window of a similar appearance to the existing main windows within the front elevation of the property. This is considered to be an acceptable alteration which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling. \r\rTo the side elevation an existing door would be blocked up and a small high level window would be added.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe conversion of the garage and alterations to the fenestration would not cause any materially harmful impacts to neighbouring amenity.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space. \r\rDespite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space. Therefore, the proposals would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal is considered not to result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity. In addition adequate car parking space for the property would be retained to the frontage, to the satisfaction of the Council.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",

    "23/01332/HOU\r\rThe application site is located to the north of Berrylands and is currently occupied by a two storey detached residential dwelling with forecourt parking to the front and a rear garden. The site is located in a largely residential area and opposite Surbiton Racket and Fitness Club. \r\rThe existing building is not statutorily listed or a locally listed building and the site is not located within a Conservation Area. \r\rThe site is in flood zone 1.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 no. objections were received.\r-\tExcessive in size\r-\tConcern it will be converted to habitable accommodation\r-\tConcern over flouting planning process \r-\tA condition is included on the parent permission which restricts outbuildings without prior written approval of local planning authority \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r23/00148/FUL - Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Conditions 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission ref: 22/00420/FUL (Demolition of existing dwelling and erection of two storey replacement dwelling with rooms in loft space and new vehicle crossover) dated: 18/10/2022. Variation to consist of addition of single storey rear extension - Granted 20 Mar 2023\r\r22/00420/FUL - Demolition of existing dwelling and erection of two storey replacement dwelling with rooms in loft space and new vehicle crossover - Granted 18 Oct 2022. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Design and character \r- Neighbour amenity  \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign and character \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rA single storey outbuilding has been practically constructed in the rear garden of the property, measuring approximately 9.2m in width, 3.5m in depth and 2.4m in height. \r\rThrough planning application 22/00420/FUL, as varied by 23/00148/FUL, a replacement dwelling was granted planning permission. A condition was attached to this permission removing permitted development for outbuildings. \r\rThe intent of this condition was not to prohibit outbuildings but, given the scope and range of building sizes allowed through Class E of the GPDO, to require planning permission to be sought for any outbuildings to ensure they were of an appropriate scale taking into account the increased size of the replacement dwelling. \r\rThis application seeks to regularise the breach of planning control. In this case, the outbuilding is discretely sited at the rear of the garden and is not unreasonable in scale or height and a rear garden of over 200sqm would be retained. Its design is also considered subservient to, and in keeping with, that of the approved replacement dwelling. \r\rFor these reasons, the outbuilding is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\r\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe outbuilding is modest in scale and height and sited away from neighbour boundaries. It is therefore not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight for adjoining neighbours.\r\rIn summary, the proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. The plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey side/rear extension\r\rConsultation\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that several properties in the area have been extended in a similar fashion adn the extension would not be highly prominent within the street scene. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, the principal properties to consider are No. 14 Egmont Avenue and also the rears of the properties adjoining the site from Egmont Road. Due to the separation distance, coupled with the lack of windows at first floor level, no harm has been identified to the properties on Edmont Road. In relation to No. 14 Egmont Avenue, the proposed rear element would comply with BRE guidance in relation to the nearest habitable window. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: While no Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021), Officers consider that the proposal should be able to meet the requirements of Policy D12(A). Were the application otherwise acceptable, a Fire Strategy would be secured by way of a planning condition. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
