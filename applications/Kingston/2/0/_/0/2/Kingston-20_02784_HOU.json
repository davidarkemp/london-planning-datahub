    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The finished floor levels of the extension hereby approved shall be no lower than the finished floor levels in the existing dwellinghouse.\r\rReason: To mitigate against potential flood risk in compliance with Policy DM4 (Water Management and Flood Risk) of the 2012 Local Development Framework Core Strategy.",

    "Application Site\rThe development site is a two-storey semi-detached property on the South side of Durlston Road within a wholly residential area. The site is not located within a conservation area or subject to any Tree Preservation Orders (TPO'S)\r\rProposal\rErection of secure shelter for access path to garden at 74 Durlston Road.\r\rConsultation\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regard to character and appearance, officers note that the shelter/lean-to would not be visible from behind the existing front boundary treatment. Officers note this would match the existing storage of the neighbouring property at approximately 2.5m in height dropping to 2.3 metres as it extends towards the garden. Overall it is considered that the proposed development is likely to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and that there would\rbe no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to its set in from the boundary coupled with the existing situation on site, It is considered unlikely that\rthere would be any significant loss of daylight/sunlight to neighbouring properties. It is noted that the submitted 'Daylight Study' assesses the impact on the neighbouring windows using a 25 degree measurement as per Policy Guidance 18 of the Kingston Residential Design SPD (2013). Overall, it is considered that the proposed development is likely to be acceptable in regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
