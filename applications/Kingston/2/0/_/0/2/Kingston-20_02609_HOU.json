    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height, and proximity to the shared boundary with adjoining No. 12 Hereford Way, would result in an undue sense of enclosure to No. 12 Hereford Way, causing an unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight and limiting the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The details submitted for Condition 29 (Delivery and Service Management Plan) were assessed by the RBK Enviromental Health Officer and Thames Water Utilities; no objection was raised regarding the submitted information.",
    "Floor Plans and Elevations must be drawn to a specific scale. The submitted Proposed Floor Plans and Elevations state \"not to scale\". Please add a scale."
