    "The proposal by reason of its scale, bulk, height and mass would be visually incongruous and intrusive when viewed from Manorgate Road. It would therefore adversely affect the character and appearance of the area and the Wolverton Avenue Local Area of Special Character, contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "Condition 19 of planning permission 22/02111/FUL states:\r\"No above ground level development shall commence until a detailed hard and soft landscaping scheme (including details of the green roofs) shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall\rbe implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which\rdie during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only.\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\"\r\rThe submitted Drawing 1015-CRK-PL 108A outlines the various types of hard landscaping - tarmac car park, permeable paviours to entrances and concrete paving to amenity areas on the ground floor. Also submitted are details of the green roof proposed - Bauder XF301 Extensive green roof system - sedum roof. The 3 trees (T1) along the north eastern boundary are Hornbeam  with a Field Maple between the parking spaces (T2), with ornamental planting at their base.\r\rOfficer comment: The Tree and Landscape Officer confirms that the submitted landscape and planting and the details of a green roof system are satisfactory, and on this basis condition 19 can be discharged.\r\rIt is also noted that an objection has been received from a neighbouring occupier, concerned that development should not encroach on the access passage, and location of bins and potential for rats.  It is also noted that the refuse store is located internally within the building, and the plan indicates an access pathway is retained  to the east of the site. Rights of way are a private matter that cannot be considered under planning legislation.\r\rConclusion: \rThe details have been reviewed and officers are satisfied that submitted details meet the requirements for condition 19 of planning permission 22/02111/FUL.",
    "As of 1st May 2024, all applicants are required to submit either a 'householder checklist' in the case of householder applications, or, a 'validation checklist' in the case of all other planning applications (except for Non material amendments, prior approval applications, lawful development applications, discharge of condition(s) applications and application for works to protected trees), in accordance with the requirements of the new local validation list. The new local validation list and checklists can be obtained via the council's website- https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications. \r\rThe LPA will not conduct any validation checks until the correct checklist has been submitted. Upon receipt of a completed checklist, the application will be assigned to a validation officer to review.\r\rIf you need to make any changes to your application please try to do this via the Planning Portal website where possible. If that is not possible please send amended documents via the email address quoted in this letter. \r"
