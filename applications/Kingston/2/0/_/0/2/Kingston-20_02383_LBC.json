    "The works hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this consent.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 18 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the methods specified in \"Statement of Significance, Heritage Impact Assessment and Design & Access Statement\" authored by Paul Travis Conservation Ltd and dated Sept 2020.\r\rReason: To prevent harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, in accordance with policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the commencement of the development to which this permission relates, samples of all materials to be used in the repair works (including any bonding, mortar or fixings) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To prevent harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, in accordance with policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development to which this permission relates (including any works of demolition), the developer shall record those parts of the building which are likely to be disturbed or concealed in the course of the works. The recording shall be carried out by an archaeologist or archaeological organisation approved by the local planning authority and the record shall be submitted to the local and national Historic Environment Record.\r\rReason: To ensure that features of archaeological or architectural importance within a building are recorded before their destruction, alteration or concealment, in accordance with policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments to planning permission reference: 22/02905/FUL:\r-\tAll glass-reinforced concrete (GRC) cladding panels from Level 2 upwards on both buildings A & B are supplied, instead, in aluminium with a specialist Interpon D2525 stone-effect PPC paint finish. \r-\tThe colour and texture of this finish will be developed as a bespoke solution to match the preferred GRC product. \r-\tAluminium cladding elements will be fabricated from 3mm thick sheet material with a recycled content of >80%. \r-\tAs with the GRC cladding option, aluminium profiles will be supported by brackets fixed to unitized curtain wall frames.\r- All GRC profile shapes, dimensions and joint locations as DAA's exemplar design can be replicated in aluminium and all mechanical fixings will be concealed.\r\rOfficers consider the proposals would not result in a material harmful effect on the character and appearance of the buildings or original design intent. Officers are similarly satisfied that the proposed amendments would not give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the development from the streetscene. It is considered that the proposals remain of a good quality, robust and durable befitting of the development. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be non-material and it is recommended that the application be granted.\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: On balance whilst the proposed extensions and alterations to the existing dwellinghouse do not follow the guiding principles of the Council's Residential Design SPD the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. This is due to the presence of a number of similar alterations and extensions to neighbouring properties in Overdale Avenue. \r\rThe proposed outbuilding would be ancillary to the main dwellinghouse and would be a subordinate addition and of an archtectural style sympathtic to its surroundings. There is a Cypress Hedge to the rear of the site. It is considered that the proposed outbuilding would not have an adverse impact on neighbouring trees. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\rThe proposal would result in the loss of a garage. Off street parking would remain to the front of the dwellinghouse where there is an area of hardstanding which would accommodate sufficient off street parking for the dwellinghouse. However the garage could lead to the loss of secure cycle storage and a condition securing secure cycle storage elsewhere on the site is recommended so as to promote and secure sustainable forms of transport alternative to the motor vehicle.\r\rA condition is recommended to secure a Fire safety strategy for the development proposed in order for the proposal to comply with policy D12 of the London Plan.  \r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Conditions 6 (Nature Conservation) and 7 (Landscaping Scheme) of planning permission 23/00028/FUL are hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
