    "The proposal would result in the loss of an existing unit of accommodation, which would not be replaced at existing or higher densities. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.14 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy DM14 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace shopping unit and relates to the basement, ground floor and first floor. The site is located within Surbiton District Centre Inset Area.\r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in use with commercial premises, offices and residential use. \r\rProposal \rChange of use from commercial unit (Use Class E) to massage/tattoo parlour (Use Class Sui Generis).\r\rConsultations\r24 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rBorough Environmental Health Officer - no objections to the proposal, suggested limiting hours of construction required to implement the development would be added to the informative section. \r\rRelevant Planning History\r23/00364/CPU Change of use from Class B1 to a massage/tattoo parlour Class E refused on 19.04.2023\r\r99/07310/FUL Erection of single storey rear extension to existing office building (Class B1) granted on 29.02.2000\r\rThe key areas of assessment are;\r- The principle of development; and,\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways.\r- Fire Safety\r\rThe principle of development:\r\rPolicy DM17 states that the Council will protect, manage and enhance all employment land and premises in local centres so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods, services and employment. \r\rPolicy DM18 states that the Council will consider applications for new employment development (of an appropriate scale) in designated employment locations favourably.\r\rPolicy DM19 states that applications for change of use that would threaten the predominance of A1 uses (current Class E) will be resisted. It will also support local shops and resist their loss (particularly convenience shops) in Local Centres and outside designated centres.\r\rOfficer comment:\rOfficers note the available planning history that contains planning permissions relating to an office unit Class B1 (superseded use class).  \r\rThe existing commercial unit Use Class E was used as a men's suit hire shop Dapper since May 2012 and it was still in use in May 2019 (according to available images on Google maps). The application site is currently vacant as stated on the application form.\r\rOfficers consider it likely that the application site does fall under an E Use Class.\r\rThe proposal would provide a massage/tattoo parlour which would fall under Class Use Sui Generis. Whilst there are appear to be a few similar uses within Surbiton District Centre, Officers consider that it would not lead to a predominance of Sui Generis Use Classes or threaten the predominance of retail/E uses within the District Centre as a whole as 88% of the occupied units are in a use falling within Use Class E of the use Classes Order 1987. Officers consider that the proposed use would be appropriate within Surbiton District Centre. Furthermore, by bringing a vacant unit back into use it would enhance the vitality and viability of Brighton Road, providing employment floorspace and employment opportunities, according to Policies DM17 and DM19 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would not involve any external alterations to the shopfront (the proposed new advertisement is subject to a separate application). As such there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the property or the immediate surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes the following opening hours: Monday to Saturday 10am-9pm and closed on Sundays and Bank Holidays, which are considered to be appropriate for the nature of the proposed use (massage and tattoo parlour). \r\rGiven that the proposed use would not likely generate additional noise than a retail shop, Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of increased noise and disturbance. \r\rFurther, given that the floorspace of the building would remain the same, with no changes to the shopfront, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site is located within a PTAL Zone 3 adjacent to a PTAL Zone 4. It is noted that no car parking for staff and customers is proposed, however given that the site is adjacent to PTAL Zone 4 and that there are available on street car parking facilities, the lack of car parking provision would be acceptable in this case. \r\rThe London Plan would require a commercial space of this nature to provide 1 long stay cycle parking space and 1 short stay cycle parking space, and while the applicant has not provided details of the proposed cycle storage, officers consider that this could be secured via an appropriate condition in the event of an approval to ensure policy compliance. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
