    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive. Due to its excessive depth and proximity to the shared boundaries the proposed development would create an undue sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties which would be detrimental to the future living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopyed LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal consists of roof alterations to the existing single-storey rear extension from a pitched roof with an eave height of approximately 2.7m to a parapet roof with an eave height of approximately 3.4m. Although the overall height of the rear extension would increase, the proposal is considered small in scale and would not be visible in the streetscene. \r\rIn regard to the alteration to the fenestration, whilst it is acknowledged that the larger door would be a visible change in the streetscene, it would not cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of Cambridge Avenue or the host dwelling. Officers considered the alterations to the front, rear and side elevation to be small in scale. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed roof alteration, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The roof alteration of the single storey rear extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 3 Cambridge Avenue, as they benefit from an existing single storey rear extension that sits at a similar depth as the existing rear extension at No. 1.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide existing and proposed site plan as mention in the checklist drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The site plan should show all public rights of way crossing or adjoining the site and should also show access arrangements, all trees and hedges within the application site and on the boundary, including trees and hedges on neighbouring land.  The plan should be annotated with key measurements, including distances to boundaries. The plan(s) must be given a unique drawing number and be clearly labelled as Existing or Proposed Site Plan. The Site Plan must show the direction of North."
