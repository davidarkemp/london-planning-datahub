    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed vehicular crossover would not harm the health and longevity of the street tree which would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the quality of the public realm within Blakes Avenue and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The Committee encouraged the use of no gas throughout Austin House (not just in the new build which was the subject of the application). Additionally The Committee encourages the applicant to review the use of solar panels on the two-storey extension or other parts of the existing roof, to look to reduce the reliance on gas across the whole estate and to increase the carbon offset across the whole estate.",
