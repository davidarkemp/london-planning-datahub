    "Insufficient information has been provided with regards to drainage hierarchy, runoff rate and maintenance of the drainage system in order to prevent the increased risk of flooding. The submitted information would not comply with Policies 5.2 (Minimising Carbon Dioxide Emissions) and 5.3 (Sustainable Design & Construction) of the London Plan (July 2011) and Policy DM1 (Sustainable Design and Construction Standards) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Kingston Community Infrastructure Levy (KCIL).  We have calculated the amount of liability to be £199,069 for Mayoral CIL and £369,352 for Kingston CIL.\r\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.  \rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge. \rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk <mailto:mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk> or phone 0208 547 5002.",
