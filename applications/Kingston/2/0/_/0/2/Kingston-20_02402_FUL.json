Granted 10 Nov 1987\r28723 - Erection of 3 storey building containing bank, shops & offices. Granted 11 Oct 1985\r\rThe main considerations material to the determination of this application are as follows:\r- Principle of Development;\r- Character, Design and Heritage Assets;\r- Neighbouring Amenity;\r- Highways and Traffic Impacts;\r\rPrinciple of Development\r\rPolicy CS11 of the Core Strategy seeks to promote key employment sectors such as retail.\r\rPolicy CS12 seeks to enhance the vitality and viability of New Malden, Surbiton and Tolworth District Centres so that they complement the role of Kingston Town Centre and remain the focus for \"walk to\" services, shopping and other town centre uses of an appropriate scale for the size of the centre, e.g. business and employment, culture, community uses, entertainment, farmers and street markets, policing, leisure and housing (including affordable housing), and continue to provide employment opportunities\r\rPolicy DM17 of the Core Strategy seeks to protect employment land and premises in District Centres.\r\rPolicy DM 19 of the Core Strategy seeks to retain shopping frontages in the District Centres (as designated on the LDF Proposals Map) predominantly for retail use, so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods and services and employment opportunities of a suitable scale for the size of the centre and or catchment area. Applications for change of use that would threaten the predominance of A1 uses will be resisted.\r\rPolicy DM20 of the Core Strategy supports new retail development in designated centres.\r\rThe site is an existing bank located within Surbiton District Centre.  The proposal intends to split the existing unit into two separate retail units. Both a bank and retail use would fall within Class E of the Use Class Order and so planning permission would not be required for a change of use. Furthermore, a retail use in this location would be supported in line with Policy DM 19 of the RBK Core Strategy. \r\rThe proposal would not result in a loss of retail floorspace and will provide 2 no. new modern retail units which is supported in line with Policy CS12, DM19 and DM20 of the RBK Core Strategy. \r\rFor these reasons, the principle of development is accepted and in accordance with the above policy framework. \r\rCharacter, Design and Heritage Assets\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rLocal policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) require that proposals relate well to their surroundings, recognise distinctive local features, have regard to the historic environment and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.  \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rOnly minor alterations are proposed to the shop front on Victoria Road and this sits within, and complements, the existing frontage. This raises no design concerns and similarly is not considered to result in harm to the setting of the Surbiton Town Conservation Area.\r\rAdvertisement consent may be needed for the new signage.\r\rIn summary, the proposal only includes modest alterations that would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the area or Conservation Area. The proposal is therefore consistent with Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012). \r\rNeighbour Amenity \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM 10 of the Core Strategy requires development proposals to \"have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\".\r\rThe existing building includes offices and a gym at the upper floor levels. Given the modest nature and scale of the changes to the use and building itself, relationship to neighbours and given the site's district centre location, the proposal is not considered to result in any undue impact on the amenity of neighbouring occupiers in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy.\r \rHighways and Traffic Impact\r\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Core Strategy requires new development to provide cycle parking in accordance with minimum standards\r\rPolicy DM9 requires new developments to comply with car parking standards.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe site is located within a highly sustainable town centre location. The existing unit is served by 2 no. parking spaces to the rear of the building. The proposal intends to re-provide 1 space for each unit. \r\rThe London Plan requires car free development for retail uses in PTAL 5 areas. In this case, the level of parking provision is accepted on the basis that the parking spaces are existing and with no additional parking being provided. \r\rIt is also noted that the site is located within a CPZ which would prevent any overspill parking from the proposed use. \r\rGiven the site is located within a town centre, and the proposal is for retail uses, no restrictions on operational hours are deemed necessary. \r\rOn this basis, the proposal is not considered to result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network or parking conditions locally given the scale and nature of the proposed use.\r\rIn line with London Plan standards, the development should provide 2 x long stay spaces. It is accepted that there is no space on site for short stay cycle spaces and there is ample on-street cycle parking in the vicinity which could be utilised. \r\rDetails of refuse and recycling and cycle storage can be secured by way of condition.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rOverall the proposed development is considered in accordance with the development plan and, as such, it is recommended that planning permission is granted. \r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments to planning permission reference: 22/03694/FUL\r\rFor Condition 4, this application seeks to split the condition into the relevant phases of the development so that a separate Construction Management Plan can be submitted and approved for each relevant phase (i.e. demolition and construction).\r\rFor Condition 15, this application seeks to amend the trigger for the BREEAM Post Construction Certificate to be submitted from 6 months to 12 months due to current delays with receiving certification from the BRE.\r\rFor Condition 25, this application seeks to amend the condition trigger to allow enabling and demolition works to be carried out prior to discharge. Amending the trigger for Condition 25 to allow demolition and other enabling works to be carried out prior to discharge would not prejudice the original intent of the condition.\r\rFor Condition 28, it is proposed to allow greater flexibility in regard to the provision of Live Music, whilst still ensuring the development still encourages and promotes live music within any marketing material.\r\rOfficers agree with the application that:-\r\rThe proposed change would be inconsequential in terms of its scale (magnitude, degree etc.) in relation to the original approval;\rThe proposed change would not result in a detrimental impact either visually or in terms of amenity;\rThe interests of any third party or body who participated in or were informed of the original decision would not be disadvantaged in any way;\rThe amendment would not be contrary to any policy of the LPA; and\rThe description of development and red line boundary for the extant scheme would remain unchanged.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be non-material and it is recommended that the application be granted.\r",
