    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\r- RBK Core Strategy 2012;\r- Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r9 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for a single storey rear extension to the dwelling which would reside adjacent to the existing single storey rear extension.  \r\rIt would  project a depth of 5.8m  which would match the depth of the existing rear extension  and a width of 4.6m . The proposed extension would present a green sedum flat roof  with a height of  3m accommodating an opening rooflight.   Aluminium sliding doors are proposed on the side and rear elevations and the proposed walls would be painted render \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Consultations\r7no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Objection received from  one postal address. Comments summarised as follows\r-     Welcome  current propsal has addressed some of the objections previously raised. However, objection still raised due to over shadowing  to small rear garden due to extent of rear building line at ground beyond Domus building line\r-    the \"Street Scene\" drawing which compares the Prima Rosa building with the Domus building, the Domus roof shape appears taller than it actually is\r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer:   No comments received.\rComments raised by Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer on previous application 23/02453/FUL (of a similar nature) raised no objection subject to conditions requiring Construction Management Plan.  \rCycle Parking: According to the London Plan Policy (T5) the proposed development must provide a total of 2 cycle parking spaces for the proposed development. The applicant has provided provision for two secured cycle parking spaces in the garden residential. This has been indicated on the proposed site layout (AAL-23-127-P01). \rCar Parking: The London Plan Policy T6.1 stipulates that the proposed development can provide a maximum of 1.5 car parking spaces for 3+ bedrooms. The applicant will be providing two off-street parking spaces with electric charging points. The applicant has provided dedicated bins at the rear of the property (indicated in the site plan) located on the ground floor and their location is considered to be acceptable in highway terms. On the basis of the above, the proposal is considered acceptable subject to the following condition: - A Construction Management Plan (CMP) \r\rPlanning History\r23/02453/FUL  Demolition of existing dwelling and garage, and erection of replacement two-storey dwelling with\rrooms in the roof and 3nos. front roof lights, refused permission 27th October 2023 on the following grounds:\r1. The proposed development, due to its design, height, bulk and massing at roof level would be incongruent with the character of the surrounding streetscene and detract from the character of the area. The proposal fails to comply with Paragraph 130 of the NPPF, 2023 and policy D3 of the London Plan, 2023, policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r2. The proposed development, by reason of its height, depth and siting would result in overshadowing and appear overbearing and result in the loss of openness and outlook when viewed from the garden of neighbouring property (Domus, High Drive), resulting in material harm to the living conditions of their occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\r94/6014/FUL Erection of single storey rear extension, alteration to roof line and installation of 2 velux windows.Application Granted on 08 Mar 1995.\r\rNeighbouring Property Domus, High Drive, New Malden, KT3 3UG\r17/15145/FULDemolition of existing bungalow and detached garage and erection of two storey dwellinghouse with basement Application Granted on 11 Jan 2018.\r\r17/14682/FUL Demolition of existing dwelling and single garage. Erection of two storey dwellinghouse plus basement.Refuse on 25 Aug 2017. Refused on the following grounds: The proposed dwelling by reason of its design, height, scale, building line, width and roof form would be out of keeping with the surrounding properties and would be detrimental to the street scene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to The NPPF, London Plan Policies 7.4, and 7.6, Policies CS08 and DMIO of the Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames I-DF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the demolition of an existing dwelling and single garage (floor area 184.38sqm) and the erection of three storey 4bedroom dwellinghouse, incorporating accommodation within roof storey (floor area 333.43 sqm.)  \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the west side of High Drive. The site has no specific land allocation within the council's Core Policy. The Berg Estate Local Area of Special character is located to the  east and south of the site.\r\rThe application site forms part of a group of 3 remaining  (part 1 storey /part 2 storey) chalet style houses  with gable end.  The adjacent house (Domus) has relatively recently been redeveloped as a two storey dwelling. High Drive  generally comprises a variety of architectural styles and is predominantly characterised by  detached two storey family housing.  \r\rThere are no listed or locally listed buildings on site, or in close proximity, and the site is not within a conservation area.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1.\r\rThe site has a PTAL of 1b (poor); it is not located within a controlled parking zone. \r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- Principle\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The standard of accommodation;\r- The amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Parking and Highways;\r- Refuse and recycling;\r- Sustainability; \r- Flood Risk and Drainage; and \r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple\rThe application seeks to erect a three storey property, including accommodation within roof storey.\r\rPolicy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted 2012) states that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing, and seeks to ensure that a broad mix of accommodation options are available to residents and that a range of local housing needs are met.\r\rPolicies CS08 and DMI0 advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rPolicy DM13 (Housing Quality and Mix) states that in order to ensure that the housing delivered is of a high quality, the council would expect proposals for new residential design to accord with the principles of good design as set out in Policies CS08 - DM11 and the Residential Design SPD.\rThe character of the area is residential with the prevailing character of properties surrounding the proposal site on High Drive being predominantly large detached houses and bungalows.\r\rThe principle of a residential use in this location is already established by the existing dwellinghouse. The proposal seeks to replace the existing dwelling house with a 4 /5 bedroom  house, which is acceptable in principle in this location, subject to compliance with other development plan policies. \r\rCharacter and Appearance \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rPolicy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings.\r\rPolicy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rDevelopment in the area surrounding the site is mixed in terms of age and architectural style. The general pattern of development is two storey detached dwellings, with recessive roofs, predominantly  hipped roofs, and including gable features. \r\rThe western side of high drive nearby the application property is characterised by one /two storey detached chalet style properties built in a similar style to the application property. \rThe proposal seeks the construction of a  substantial three storey dwelling with accommodation within the roof to replace the modestly scaled house. The proposed house would have a ridge height of 8.3m and an eaves height of 5m.  Officers consider that the proposed roof form to be of excessive height and bulk,  and would appear top heavy in appearance due to its bulk, massing and design, with a steep pitch and large flat roof area. \r\rOverall it is concluded  that the  proposed replacement building would be of excessive scale and mass that would  be  incongruent with the character of the surrounding buildings. \rIt is noted that with the refused scheme for the adjacent building, the highest point of the roof of the proposed property was approximately 8.1 metres in height and the roof ridge would be approximately 6 metres in height to the eaves. The subsequent approved scheme  had a ridge height of 7.78m and an eaves  height of 5.7m.  \r\rIn terms of siting, the proposed property would have a similar degree of setback from the front edge of pavement  as both neighbouring properties and would retain a degree of separation from the boundaries  (969mm to the north and 1356m to the south with a pinch point of 990mm ). It would have a depth of approximately 17m metres, with the main two storey element 12.1m with the ground floor projecting a further 4.9metres  to the rear. The proposed property would match the materials of the adjacent house, red brick and slate tiles. \r\rOverall it is concluded that whilst the street is on a slight slope, the proposed building would not relate well to its context and would be incongruent within the streetscene by reason of its scale, bulk, incongruent roof form.\r  \rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2023  states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants, and provide  a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3  or more bedrooms.  \r\rThe proposed  four/five  bedroom dwelling would comply with the minimum standards set out by the London Plan and provides for family sized accommodation for which there is an identified need.    \r \rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows).  The proposal would significantly exceed minimum standards.\r\rFire Safety\rA Fire Strategy has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety, in accordance with Policy D12 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2023 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable \rlevels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe main two storey element of the proposed house  would align with the recently completed house to the north. At ground floor level it would extend a further  4.9 metres, to align with the rear building  line to the south, Conifers.  This ground floor element  would extend  2.5 m beyond the rear ground building line of the recently completed development to the north, Domus. This  shear fank wall  would be 3.37m in height, set less than 1 metre from the boundary. Whilst the proposal would not result in any material loss of light to habitable room windows, this increase in height and bulk along the boundary,  is considered excessive and would result in overshadowing  of the garden and would cause an uncomfortable sense of enclosure and overbearingness to the relatively small garden to the neighbouring property.\r\rAlthough of significantly increased height and mass, the proposed house would not result in any material loss of daylight, sunlight or enclosure to the neighbouring house to the south Conifers.\r\rOverall, Officers consider that the above impacts would amount to material harm to the living conditions of the occupiers of Domus, High Drive due to the depth,  height and siting, of the of the proposed development. In these respects, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. This is afforded significant weighting against the proposals in the overall assessment.\r\rParking and Highways\r\rCar Parking: Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. The maximum parking standard for the new dwelling proposed is 1.5 space.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe existing property has two front car parking spaces and the proposed site plans details the location of 2 car parking spaces. RBK's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has raised no objections to the proposal. Therefore the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of its highways impacts.\r\rCycle Parking: Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2, ensuring that a minimum of two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided for the proposed three bedroom house. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards.  Cycle parking for 2no. cycles are shown at the rear  of the proposed building. \r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house. \r\rThe application has proposed to locate the refuse and recycling bins in a bin store at the side of the property. This is considered to be acceptable as it would mitigate any increase in street clutter. \r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2023 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency, which could be secured by way of condition.\r\rDrainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to incorporate sustainable drainage systems unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.\rThe application form states that the proposed development would incorporate a sustainable drainage system but no details of this system have been provided. It is considered that details of the system could be secured by a suitably worded condition.\r\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. \rThe development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 3, for which the charge is £85 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5 year housing supply. \r \rThe proposed development would provide  a replacement family dwelling,  it does not provide additional housing.  This is therefore neutral in the assessment\rThe proposed development, due to the height, design, bulk and massing  is considered  to detract  from the character of the area. This is afforded moderate weight against the proposal.\rIn terms of impact upon neighbouring amenity, the proposals are considered to result in harm to the occupiers of the neighbouring  property to the north  in terms of impact upon outlook and sense of overbearing and visual dominance as a result of the proposed siting and scale of the proposed development. Officers assign moderate  weighting against the proposals in the overall planning balance exercise in this regard.\rThere is appropriate parking, cycle and refuse/recycling storage to serve the proposed development. This is neutral in the assessment\rOverall, it is concluded that the proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and it is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the provision of the replacement dwelling house in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. The proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\rIt is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be Granted",
    "The site involves the boundaries of Leighton House on Oak Hill Road. The site is located within Oakhill Conservation Area.\r\rConsultations\r34 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r- Heritage Officer / Conservation Architect - Objection\r- Surbiton CAAC - No Objection\r- RBK Tree & Landscape Officer - No Objection\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on esignated & non-designated heritage assets.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Tree & Landscape.\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Heritage\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant proposes to demolish and replace an existing wall, located just off Oak Hill Road, on a pedestrian route. It has an approximate staggered height between 1.1m to 1.2m which is to be replaces with matching brickwork. The applicant also proposes to replace another brick wall which is being held up from falling with timber supports with a \"temporary\" feather edged fence. The proposed fence would have a height of approximately 1.8m. It has not been indicated within the submission for how long the \"temporary\" fence is proposed for.\r\rThe Council's Heritage Officer / Conservation Architect objects to the scheme for the following reasons:\r\r- In the first instance, for health and safety for residents and the general public, barriers should be put up around the leaning walls, to limit access in proximity to the wall. A qualified structural engineer should calculate the adequate propping required to maintain the temporary stability of the wall, and the design a long-term solution.\r- No heritage statement has been provided to explain the impact of the proposal on the significance of Oakhill conservation area. The walls look to be remnants of the historic boundary walls of the plot of no. 4 Oakhill Grove (the dwelling demolished for the construction of Leighton House). No other historic boundary walls remain in the immediate vicinity.\r- The need for the wholesale demolition of these parts has not been evidenced\r\rWall 2:\r- The proposed 'like-for-like' replacement of the boundary wall with no. 5 Oak Hill is accepted in principle.\r- More detail should be provided on the elevation drawing, to illustrate the brick setting out.\r- Material palette and specification should be provided.\r\rWall 1:\r- The historic boundary wall makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. Even though it only exists as a remnant, the replacement with a timber fence have a harmful impact on the significance of the conservation area, particularly as there is no indication of a future long-term solution. - The existing planting including the laurel shrubs and ivy is likely to be compromising the structural integrity of the wall, and this should be removed to enable an examination of the wall structure, so that a suitable repair or replacement scheme can be designed by a qualified structural engineer.'\r\rOverall, given the lack of material specification for the boundary treatment along 5 Oak Hill Road and the replacement of an existing brick wall with a timber fence for the boundary along Leighton House, it is considered that the proposal would result in a loss of historic fabric which would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Oakhill Conservation Area and would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rTrees and Landscape\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted an Arboricultural Report, a Tree Protection Plan and a Tree Survey Plan. The council's Tree and Landscape officer has assessed the details and has raised no objection to the proposed boundary treatment. Therefore, the proposed boundary treatment would safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. The Council's Tree and Landscape officer would also be a consultee on any subsequent planning applications.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rThe proposals would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Oakhill Conservation Area and would fail to preserve its character and appearance. In accordance with Paragraph 208 of the NPPF (2023) the identified harm must be weighed against any public benefits of the proposal. It is indicated that one of the walls is being propped up and that it may pose a safety risk: if this is the case the proposals would provide some benefit to residents at Leighton House and adjoining properties. However, as the Council's Heritage Officer has noted it is unclear whether the removal of the wall is necessary. If its removal is necessary, it is unclear why a lower quality replacement in the form of timber fencing is necessary. Within this context, it is considered that the limited benefits of the proposal would not outweigh the identified less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
