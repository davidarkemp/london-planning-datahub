    "The Council considers the amendments to be material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment is refused.",
    "Consultations\r43no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Two valid representations (received from different names persons/different addresses) received objecting to the proposals with concerns summarised as follows:\r-\tCar parking supply insufficient to serve the proposed development\r-\tUnacceptable/incompatible use \r-\tNoise\r\rOfficer comment: Duly noted. Please refer to assessment section for consideration on relevant comments to be taken into account by Officers as material considerations. Officers must determine the proposals on the basis of the plans submitted. Whilst those concerns regarding the end use of the development as a HMO are noted, such use has not been applied for and officers must assess as a residential dwelling (Use Class C3). Those concerns raised regarding the noise from the residents is not a matter for planning, but is instead a civil matter. \r\rPlanning History\r23/00696/FUL - Sub-division of the existing family house into 2nos self-contained residential units. Conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of a single storey front porch. Alteration to fenestration. Refused planning permission, dated 14 August 2023 for the following reasons:\r\r(1)\tThe proposal due to its design, provides a poor quality of accommodation for future residents due to the substandard size of the internal accommodation necessary for a 1-bed, 2-person unit. As such the proposal fails to comply with Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13 Housing Quality and Mix of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\r(2)\tThe proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13 Housing Quality and Mix of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012, owing to its failure to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height.\r\r\r(3)\tThe size of the proposed external amenity space for both the newly proposed unit and the existing dwellinghouse cannot be verified from the information submitted as part of the planning application. When measured from the scale provided on the plans, the external amenity areas would fall significantly below local minimum space standards for outdoor amenity space. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012, and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.\r\r19/01470/LDE - Change of Use of Dwellinghouse (Use Class C3) to House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) (Use Class Sui Generis) (Retrospective Application). Refused, dated 11.09.2019.\r\r06/14223/FUL - Erection of first floor side extension including associated extensions to roof and formation of 2 x sunpipes to rear roof slope. Granted planning permission, dated 05.05.2006.\r01/06369/FUL - Erection of a part single storey, part two storey side extension and single storey rear extension. Granted planning permission, dated 25.10.2001.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the Subdivision of the existing family house into 2nos self-contained residential units. Conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of a single storey front porch. Alteration to fenestration.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the southern side of Kenley Road, wrapping around the corner with Orme Road. The site is occupied by a two-storey, double fronted semi-detached dwellinghouse with integral garage. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance consisting mainly of semi-detached dwellings. \r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area or local area of special character, and the buildings and curtilage are not statutory or locally listed, nor in proximity to any heritage assets.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of accommodation;\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Transportation;\r- Refuse and recycling;\r- Sustainability; \r- Fire Safety; and \r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\r\rThe site is in an established residential area and its use for residential purposes is well established. The principle of creating a new residential unit within an established residential area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2023 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the new dwelling to be 1bedroom, 1person (studio) size arranged on one floor (the pre-existing dwelling would become a 4-bedroom, 8-person dwellinghouse across two storeys). \r\rAccording to the standards, a studio sized dwelling arranged over one floor should have a minimum GIA of 37sqm (where a shower room is shown as in this instance). The proposed dwelling would provide approximately 40sqm internal floorspace and, so, would slightly exceed the minimum floorspace standards for a studio unit.\r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for storage is 1sqm. The proposed dwelling shows built in storage in excess of this requirement. \r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\r\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rThe proposed bed space would also serve as the living space and would measure approximately 27sqm and would be compliant with the above floor space standards.\r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has provided annotation elevations to demonstrate that the proposed accommodation would meet the internal space standard requirements with particular regard to floor to ceilings - that is, 2.6m at ground floor and 2.5m at first floor.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed new dwelling would be dual aspect with windows provided to the front (north) and rear (south) elevations. Officers consider that the proposed dwelling would be afforded sufficient natural light, good outlook and ventilation for the size of dwelling.\r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have 50m2 of private outdoor space (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third).\r\rThe garden area at the rear of the existing plot will be subdivided to provide each dwelling with its own private amenity space.\r\rWhen scaling off the proposed site plan, the donor property (No. 9) is shown to have approximately 112sqm of rear private garden, whilst the newly proposed unit is shown to be given a private garden area of approximately 43sqm. \r\rOverall\rThe overall floor area of the proposed unit meets minimum GIA standards and floor to ceiling heights have been annotated to the submitted elevations demonstrating compliance with London Plan in this regard. These matters, therefore, address the previous areas of concern raised by officers under the recently refused application. Officers have measured the garden areas with the amenity space provided for the larger pre-existing donor property to be larger of the two spaces, in excess of minimum standards. However, the proposed studio would be afforded private amenity space below the Council's minimum standards. Given the proposed size of the unit and its likely occupancy by a single person, this matter is afforded limited weighting against the proposals.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe new dwelling will be created from the sub-division of the existing dwellinghouse and the subdivision of the existing plot.\r\rThe external appearance of both the existing dwelling (i.e. No 9) and the newly proposed dwelling (No. 9a) will largely remain unchanged to what currently exists and, as such, would not harm the character and appearance of the site and the surrounding area. The proposed front porch would be an acceptable addition to the front elevation; the rear elevation would be unaltered from that as existing.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the prevailing character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2023 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1.\r \rThe proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision or privacy of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2023 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\rAccess\rThe vehicular access to the site would be from that as existing and not require changes from that as existing. \r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 3, which represents a moderate level of accessibility by means of public transport. Policy 6.1 within Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021 requires the proposed development to have a maximum of 0.75 car parking spaces per 1-bed dwelling and a maximum of 1 car parking space per 3+bed dwelling.\rThe proposed development would be in accordance with the maximum car parking standards set out in Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards. Development proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for minimum of 2no. cycle parking spaces per dwelling. Cycle storage is not indicated on the proposed plans, however officers acknowledge that provision could be made to the front or rear gardens and details of the enclosures could be secured by an appropriately worded condition.\r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rWhere containers need to be permanently stored to the front of a property, they should be housed in dedicated storage structures, which should be sited sensitively and where appropriate, well screened and appropriately landscaped so as to preserve and enhance the character of the street scene. In general, waste stores, typically containers, should not be sited to project forward of the established building line. A dedicated waste store should be constructed of materials appropriate to its context, particularly where the development site is in a sensitive location, for example a conservation area.\r\rThe plans show the provision of waste and recycling bins for the dwellings to the frontage area. Details of the design and materiality of the refuse/recycling enclosure would be secured by way of condition.\r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2023 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy SI2 of the London Plan 2021 requires all new major developments to be zero carbon. However, it does not set any requirements for minor developments.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. \r\rThe development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 3, for which the charge is £85 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rSignificant weight is given in the assessment of the proposals providing for one net additional residential dwellinghouse. \rOfficers find that the proposed development would provide good quality living accommodation for future occupiers of the property. The overall floor area of the proposed studio unit would comply with GIA standards. The applicant has demonstrated floor to ceiling heights across the proposed development and these comply with the London Plan. \r\rWhen officers measure from the scale given on the plans, the garden areas serving the donor property (No. 9) would be significantly above the Council's minimum standards for private amenity areas. However, the garden space to serve the proposed studio unit would be below the Council's minimum standards. Given the proposed size of the new unit and its likely occupancy and the slight deficit in the garden area when measured against policy expectations (i.e. less than 10sqm deficit), this is afforded limited weighting against the proposals. \r\rThe proposals have been assessed as acceptable in terms of impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and area, impact to neighbouring amenity and car parking. Whilst cycle and storage is not explicitly indicated on the plans, officers acknowledge that there would be sufficient space either to the front of the building or contained to the rear to accommodate and further details could be secured by way of condition. These matters are given neutral weighting.\r\rIt is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission (that is, the deficit in the private amenity space) would not significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the provision of a new residential unit in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rIt is, therefore, recommended that the application be granted.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
