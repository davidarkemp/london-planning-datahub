    "The proposed development would result in the net loss of approximately 44sqm of Class A1 employment floorspace and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed residential use would not prejudice the continued operation and viability of the site for employment purposes, contrary to Policies DM17 and DM19 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent evidence, that the proposed dwelling would receive adequate levels of daylight and sunlight, that sufficient private amenity space would be provided, and that the proposed dwelling would benefit from sufficient outlook and levels of privacy, contrary to Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and the London Plan Housing SPG (2016).",
    "The proposed light well would be a discordant feature which would detract from the balanced and well-proportioned appearance of the shopfront and would be an incongruous feature within the streetscape. The proposal would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by the public benefits of the proposal, contrary to Policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policies 3.5 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "No mechanism to preclude residents of the proposed dwelling from applying for on street residents parking permits (including visitor permits) and for permits to park in Council-owned car parks in the area has been submitted.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within St Andrews Square Conservation Area. The significance of the St Andrews Square Conservation Area is derived from the area of Victorian housing dating from the 1860s - 1880s, in Gothic and Classical styles, including a garden square unique to South West London. It forms a later phase of the Surbiton \"New Town\" begun in 1838 by Thomas Pooley. \r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey side extension with associated changes to fenestration\r\rConsultation\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified and one letter of objection has been received stating;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rThe points raised will be considered as part of the assessment.\r\rSurbiton CAAC: No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the St Andrews Square Conservation Area; and\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side extension would be in general compliance with Policy guidance 35 of the residential design SPD. It has been set far back from the front elevation and set in from the boundary so guttering does not overhang adjoining land.\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to amenity the principal property to be considered is No. 6 Cottage Grove. Officers note that due to the seperation distace between the two properties there is already a loss of light with regards to the 25 degree rule. Its is considered that the proposed side extension would not increase the loss of light any further than the installation of a new boundary treatment would. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the St Andrews Square Conservation Area. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the St Andrews Square Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located on Westbury Road.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single-storey rear extension\r\rRelevant planning history:\r02/14337/FUL- Erection of single storey side extension and alterations to garage to form a granny annex- GRANTED 24.10.2002.\r\rConsultations\r7x properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed conversion of the garage into habitable room and the front porch extension are considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and immediate surrounding area. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth which are in this case up to 3.5m. However, considering the size of the plot and the existing extension at the neighbouring property the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of its scale, mass and bulk and the proposed design. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the modest flat roof height of the proposed ground floor extension, the proposed addition to the existing ground floor extension would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r20 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received by neighbouring properties relating to:\r\r- Excessive height/bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rThe concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor extension would generally comply with the guidance of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 34. It would respect the pitched roof form of the host dwelling and this form of development is not incongruous in the immediate vicinity of Bonner Hill Road, as several dwellings in the area have two-storey rear outriggers/extensions. However, the adjoining neighbour does not benefit from this type of extension, as such the construction of this first floor extension would include a large blank wall on the boundary and would appear odd to the pair of semi-detached dwellings and in the wider area. \r\rTherefore, it is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and the proposed extension is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Policy Guidance 34, of the Residential Design SPD state:\r- On narrow width properties - particularly terraced properties, two storey rear extensions are unlikely to be appropriate as they often result in an unreasonable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook for adjoining properties.\r- Adequate daylighting and sunlighting of neighbouring properties should be maintained using the 45 and 25 degree principles\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light. Officers acknowledge the additional information provided as to No. 32 Bonner Hill Roads' future development plans, however, officers can not take into account theoretical schemes in order to determine this application. Considering the proposed development without the addition of No. 32 Bonner Hill Road's future plans, the proposal would have an overbearing appearance, undue sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of light.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
