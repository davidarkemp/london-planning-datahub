    "The proposed erection of rear dormer to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises semi-detached building and the proposed development relates to the ground floor maisonette.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Flood Risk.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a total pitched roof height of 2.9m and a modest depth of 3m, which falls within the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33. Additionally, it would not be visible from the street and would not occupy more than 50% of the existing garden space. \r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45  Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD. Given the siting of the development in relation to neighbouring properties/habitable room windows, it is considered that the development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
