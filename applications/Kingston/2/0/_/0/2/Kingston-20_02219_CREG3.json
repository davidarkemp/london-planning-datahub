In relation to the loading/unloading provisions, the applicant has provided tracking to show vehicles attempting deliveries. However, this fails to mention any traffic or pedestrian management which will be required. It also fails to mention how the deliveries will be transferred to site from the\rdelivery vehicles. In addition to these details RBK Highways require the applicant to provide evidence that TfL have authorised the temporary relocation of the Taxi rank which is to be used as a loading area as well as any parking suspensions that may be required. The document contradicts itself in that in one section it mentions they will not be storing any materials on site and in another it mentions that there will be designated storage area. A site layout will greatly help in demonstrating the allocated areas. Although the applicant has given a description of their proposed construction vehicles traffic route,\ra routing map should be provided to gain a better description and understanding of the information, which they have listed on page 10 of the plan. The routing steps provided by the applicant do seem to be missing some information. The route, described, approaches the site from the south, however the tracking information shown earlier shows vehicles approaching from the north. Approaching the site from the south means that the vehicle is on the opposite side of the carriageway to the site/proposed suspended taxi bay. There is no description of how the delivery vehicle will approach the suspended bays as shown in the tracking information. The plan has not provided any information with respect to statutory undertaker connections. The plan should mention whether this will be required for the development site and if so, the contractor\r(or relevant utility company) will have to apply for a Section 50 Street Works Licence, which will authorise them to place their apparatus within the public highway and carry out statutory undertaker connections to relevant utilities;\r",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r19 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey side and rear extension. Installation of 1no front and 1 no rear roof light and 1no rooflight in outrigger. Internal alterations. \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey side and rear extension. Installation of 1 no front and 1no rear roof light in outrigger. Internal alterations.  demolish an existing garage and the erection of a single storey side extension to match the size of existing. \r\rThe existing outrigger projects a depth of 6.782m and width 3.4m garage projects a depth of 4.8m and width 2.6m. It has a single aspect pitch roof with an eaves height of 1.22m and  maximum pitch height  of 2.176m. The rear elevation presents a single window. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project a depth of 2m off the existing outrigger and a width of 3.5m . It would present a single aspect slate tiled  roof with an eaves height of 1.43m and maximum pitch height of 1.72m.   The proposed roof would accommodate 2 rooflights. The proposed rear elevation wall would present timber frame bifold windows and the proposed side elevation of this rear extension would present  glazed doors.\r\rThe proposed side extension would present a depth of 6.49m and width of 1.96m.  It would present a  single aspect roof with an eaves height of 1.418m and maximum pitch height of 1.609m. The proposed roof would  be glazed and a  timber frame picture window would  be presented on the rear elevation. No fenestration is proposed on the side elevation. \r\rIn terms of proposed finishes and materials, both single storey extensions would be constructed in yellow London Stock bricks to match existing.   \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side and rear  extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rConsultations\r32 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rSurbiton  Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection. No material impact on the Conservation Area.\r\rRBK Heritage and Conservation Lead - No heritage statement has been provided with the application, to comply with NPPF paragraph 200. The site lies within the plot of no 34 Grove Road (locally listed), which sits within Cadogan Road Conservation Area in Surbiton.\r\rHeritage Impacts: The proposal seeks to subdivide the plot of no 34 Grove Road by introducing a new dwelling in the backyard. There is no precedent of this within the conservation area - which is generally characterised by large detached and semi detached villas in substantial garden plots. The proposed development would harm the prevailing pattern and form of development and would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Cadogan Road Conservation Area. This would cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the conservation area. The proposal would also have adverse impacts on the significance of no. 34 Grove Road - it would impact the garden setting of the house with the creation of a hard boundary, and having multiple windows look out directly onto this.\r\rWhile permission was given in 2014 for the erection of an outbuilding, this was an ancillary structure to the main house of no 34, not a separate dwelling. The erection of a dwelling would necessitate a boundary to the site, in this proposal to be treated with fencing. This physically subdivides the plot and effectively eliminates half of the garden to no. 34. The proposal, while still of a single storey, would extend further forward, leaving a narrow gap between it and the main house. The form and appearance of the proposed dwelling has not been designed as an 'outbuilding' with consideration of how it should relate to the main house.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of an existing outbuilding and erection of a 1no bed single storey dwellinghouse.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a ground floor flat. \r\rThe application site is within a Cadogan Road Conservation Area and is within the curtilage of a locally listed building (Building of Townscape Merit).  \r\rPlanning History\r\r16/12726/NMA -  Variation of condition 3 (Sole use of outbuilding) of planning permission 14/13251 to read the outbuilding to be occupied solely for purposes ancillary to the occupation and enjoyment of the application property (Flat 1b Grove Road). Granted 10.08.16 .\r\r16/12272/LDP  - The use of the detached outbuilding by the applicant to administrate an internet based taxi business between the hours of 9am and 5pm weekdays only with no visiting members of the public or other employees. Granted  01.09.16 \r\r14/13251/FUL -  Erection o single storey ancillary outbuilding for purposes of home working following demolition of existing out building (application site address Flat 1b, 34 Grove Road).Granted  02.02.16\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r- Standards of Accommodation \r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Housing Delivery \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal seeks planning permission for the demolition of an existing outbuilding and erection of a 1 bed single storey dwellinghouse with  outside enclosed private amenity space and refuse and cycle storage provision within the proposed curtilage.\r\rThe existing outbuilding  is located in the rear garden of Flat 1a, 34 Grove Road and is  utilised as a garage. It projects a depth of 8.01m and width of 3.3m. It has a parapet height of 2.8m and flat roof height of 2.38m.  An open sided canopy carport is positioned in front of the building. \r\rThe  application site presents a site area of 77.8 sqm with the proposed dwelling occupying 50.76 sqm (GEA) and associated  outdoor private amenity space 16.27 sqm which would be enclosed by fencing. \r\rThe  proposed single storey dwelling would be 'L shaped'  and present an overall depth of 10.82m and maximum width of 5.44m, with the front elevation presenting a width of 3.29m.  It would have a maximum proposed flat roof height of  3m. Fenestration would be presented on the  east elevation and  set back front elevation.  Both the  proposed dwelling and associated outdoor private amenity space would be accessed via a gate on the fenced front elevation.It would be constructed in brick clad with zinc details reliefs in the facades.   Refuse and cycle storage would be positioned in front of the proposed dwelling. \r\rPlanning permission 14/13251/FUL was originally  granted approval for the erection of a single storey outbuilding for the purposes of home working and was later subject to  S96a NMA application  (ref 16/12726/NMA) establishing  planning approval for the outbuilding to be occupied solely for purposes ancillary to the occupation and enjoyment of the application property (Flat 1b Grove Road).   At the time there were other examples of outbuildings in the rear gardens of surrounding properties and  it was considered the proposed outbuilding would  not be out of character with the immediate surrounding properties and area. \r\rHowever, Officers consider the proposed dwellinghouse together with the associated outdoor private amenity space would result in a change in  both the overall character and appearance of the  rear garden  as well as the curtilage of the existing dwelling.  Policy Guidance 8 Garden Development  in the Residential Design SPD advises where new residential development on garden land which is out of character with the existing form of development and  urban grain will be resisted. Comprehensive development that creates a sense of place in themselves will be considered subject to criteria. In this instance, it is considered that the proposal does not incorporate existing landscape features nor harmonise with the character and setting of the area.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site  together with  its immediate surroundings and wider area, it is considered the proposed single storey dwellinghouse, would be unacceptable  in terms of scale, form, massing, space and design. It is considered it would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers note the proposed single storey dwelling and associated outdoor private amenity space has been designed to be enclosed and thereby would result in the subdivision of the rear garden plot. In addition, it is also considered that the proposal would present a built form which would have an overbearing appearance within the rear garden  and thereby altering the direct outlook  when viewed by existing occupiers of the flats within no 34 Grove Road and potentially from other neighbouring properties at higher levels.\r\rIn addition, the proposal would also result in the loss of private outdoor amenity space associated with existing Flat 1a, no 34 Grove Road. \r\rOverall,  it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of privacy.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. \r\rLondon Plan Guidance (LPG) Housing Design Standards (June 2023)  provides a set of standards that relate to housing design.\r\rFor no1 bedroom single storey dwelling, LPG Housing Design Standards recommends a minimum gross internal area and storage of  37 - 39 sqm. The proposal presents 39 sqm (GIA). In terms of private outside space, LPG Housing Standards recommends a minimum of 5 sqm of step free private outside space for homes with one to two bedspeces with a minimum depth and width of 1.5sqm. The proposal would provide 16.27 sqm.\r\rPolicy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rTo conclude, the proposal would comply with the London Plan Guidance Housing Design Standards. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 200 to 214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 205 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rThe site is located within the Cadogan Road Conservation Area. It is considered the proposed development would harm the prevailing pattern and form of development and would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Cadogan Road Conservation Area. It would result in less than substantial harm to the designated heritage asset of Cadogan Road Conservation Area. In addition, it is considered the proposal  would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of no 34 Grove Road as  a non-designated heritage asset including its curtilage.\r\rParagraph 202 of the NPPF (2023) advises that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use. In this instance, there would be no public benefits to the proposal which would outweigh the identified harm outside of those short term benefits associated with the construction of the  single storey 1no bedroom dwellinghouse. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form, and noting the above assessment, it is considered that the proposed dwellinghouse would have an adverse impact on the  character and appearance of the area and would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of Cadogan Road Conservation Area and to the locally listed building of no 34 Grove Road.\r\rHousing Delivery\rThe NPPF (2023) directs that housing applications should be considered in the context of the presumption in favour of sustainable development. It further states that planning should deliver a wide choice of high quality homes, widen opportunities for home ownership and create sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities. It further states that planning should encourage the effective use of land in meeting the need for homes and to make as much use as possible of previously developed or 'brownfield' land, provided that it is not  of high environmental value.\r\rPolicy H1 (increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets  ten year targets for new housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20  - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) directs that the Council, with partners, will seek to meet and exceed the Borough' annual housing target as set out in the London Plan, by taking full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing and, in particular maximise the delivery of affordable housing. It continues by stating that new housing should be delivered in the most sustainable location.\r\rGiven the Local Planning Authority are unable to demonstrate a 5 year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted  unless (i) the application of policies in the NPPF that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.\r\rIt is noted that policies in relation to 'designated heritage assets' are listed under footnote 7, linked to paragraph 11 (d) (i) of the NPPF (2023). Where designated heritage assets related issues were to provide a clear reason for refusing the planning application the so called 'tilted balance' would be engaged. \r\rAs cited above in this report, Paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2023) advises that where a development proposed will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public  benefits of the proposal including where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use. In this instance, there would be no public benefits to the proposal which would outweigh the identified harm outside of the minor benefit associated  with the construction of the single storey 1no bedroom dwellinghouse. Therefore,  the 'tilted balance' in favour of supporting the proposal would be  disengaged  on the basis that  the proposal would lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset  would warrant the justification that planning permission is refused. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension, demolition of first floor side dormer roof extension and erection of first floor side and rear extension. Conversion of garage to habitable room. Changes to front and side fenestrations.\r\rIt is noted that permission for the single storey rear extension was granted under permission 22/02908/HOU dated 16.11.2022 and that there are no proposed changes to this extension even though it has been oncluded as part of this application.\r\rConsultation\r28 neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r- Loss of light\r- Loss of privacy\r- Harm to leafy green character of the area\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. 'Cat-slide' roofs are distinct features found in many streets throughout the Borough. In many cases this feature\rhas been lost or eroded through first floor side extensions. 'cat-slide' roofs on the majority of properties represent a very distinctive character. As such, the retention of those features is important. The proposed side exntension would result in the total loss of this important feature. It is also noted that the roposed extension would fail to comply with policy guidance 36 of the residentail design SPD as the proposed extension has not been set down from the original ridge height or set back from the front elevation. \rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that thenumber of windows in the side elevation facing No. 2 Sylvan garden has increased. Should permission be granted a condition would be applied that any side facing windows at first floor or above be obscured glazed and non opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed in order to ensure privacy for the neighbouring property is maintained. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site is a commercial unit and is located in the designated Kingston Town Centre and the Kingston Old Town Conservation a designated heritage asset. The building is also a statutorily listed Grade II building. \r\rDetails of the Listing are as follows \r\rLocation\rStatutory Address:\r15 and 16 Market Place, Kingston upon Thames, KT1 1JP\r\rCounty:\rGreater London Authority\rDistrict:\rKingston upon Thames (London Borough)\rParish:\rNon Civil Parish\rNational Grid Reference:\rTQ 17879 69257\rSummary\rShop 1909, for Boots the Chemists by their architect M V Treleaven; extended 1929 by Percy J Bartlett. Sculpted figures probably by Gilbert Searle & Son.\r\rReasons for Designation\rNos.15 and 16 Market Place, formerly Boots the Chemists, designed by their architect M V Treleaven, and extended 1929 by Percy J Bartlett, are listed at Grade II for the following principal reasons:\r\r* Architectural interest: a handsome early C20 shop facade, typical of Boots house style in its Jacobean Revival manner and depiction of local events of importance, in this case the crowning of the Saxon kings in Kingston;\r\r* Fixtures and fittings: the exterior is adorned with statuary and memorial cartouches while the impressive stained glass stair window also commemorates the crowning of the Saxon kings;\r\r* Group value: it stands prominently at the head of the historic Market Square and its rich diversity of buildings, adjacent to the Grade I listed parish church and Grade II* listed Market House.\r\rHistory\rKingston upon Thames, historically in Surrey, was an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period, while there is evidence of Saxon settlement and of activity dating from the prehistoric period and of Roman occupation. It is close to the important historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park, Richmond and Richmond Park. The old core of the town, around All Saints Church (C14 and C15, on an earlier site) and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is 'the best preserved of its type in outer London' (Pevsner and Cherry, London: South, 1983 p. 307). Kingston thrived first as an agricultural and market town and on its historic industries of malting, brewing and tanning, salmon fishing and timber exporting, before expanding rapidly as a suburb after the arrival of the railway in the 1860s. In the later C19 it become a centre of local government, and in the early C20 became an important shopping and commercial centre. Its rich diversity of buildings and structures from all periods reflect the multi-facetted development of the town. \r\rThe shop occupies two plots at the head of the historic Market Place, and is a replacement, or at least a re-fronting of its predecessor which was built in 1880. It was built by Boots, the Chemists, in 1909 by their architect M V Treleaven, although the design of the façade has also been attributed to Dr William Finney, antiquarian and seven times mayor of Kingston. An inscribed cartouche records that the ancient title of Royal Borough was conferred on the town by King George V in 1927. Perhaps in consequence, the right hand bay was added in 1929 by the architect Percy J Bartlett, echoing the original theme. The originally symmetrical shop front was rearranged to place the new entrance centrally in the enlarged building, beneath a new fascia.\r\rThe shop is one of approximately 16 black and white mock timber framed stores built by Boots between 1903 and 1914, as it were in a house style. Most of them were designed by A N Bromley, though M V Treleaven may have developed the original concept and was certain responsible for two of the early stores (Kings Lynn, 1903 and Winchester, 1905). Typically they commemorate locally important historic figures or events, for example in Derby including Florence Nightingale and in Bury St Edmunds, Canute. In Kingston the shop commemorates the crowning of the Saxon kings. The sculpted figures of the monarchs are probably by Gilbert Searle & Son.\r\rDetails\rShop 1909, for Boots the Chemists by their architect M V Treleaven; extended 1929 by Percy J Bartlett. Sculpted figures probably by Gilbert Searle & Son.\r\rMATERIALS: brick and timber frame, the façade in stucco, with applied timber framing, stone dressings and statuary. Plain tile roofs.\r\rPLAN: purpose-built shop in three bays and four storeys. The original shop occupied the narrower central and left hand bays of the current building and had a symmetrical shop front with a central entrance. When the building was extended by a bay to the right the ground floor shop front was redesigned to create a central entrance. The upper floors of the new wing echo the original design which was adapted slightly to accommodate the extension.\r\rEXTERIOR: is in three gabled bays with first and second floor oriel windows and smaller canted bay windows on the upper floor. Windows have moulded timber cross casements with diamond leaded lights beneath bracketed cornices. Below the second floor windows are coats of arms and insignia. The gables are timber framed with ornate bargeboards and finials. Between each bay is a vertical panel enriched with sculpted figures beneath cusped canopies and with low relief cartouches and heraldic emblems. To the left the figures depict Edward the Elder and Henry; framing the central bay are Edward III and Elizabeth and to the right Althelstan and John.\r\rAt first floor level an inscribed panel records that NEAR THIS SPOT WERE CROWNED THE FOLLOWING KINGS / CROWNED AD / EDWARD the Elder 902 / ATHELSTAN 924 / EDMUND 940 / EDRED 946 / EDWY 955 / EDWARD the Martyr 975 / ETHELRED 979\r\rAdjacent to it a moulded panel is inscribed THE / ROYAL BOROUGH/ OF / KINGSTON UPON / THAMES / In 1927 / THE ANCIENT TITLE / OF / ROYAL BOROUGH / WAS / CONFIRMED / TO KINGSTON BY / KING GEORGE V The shop front, has slender glazing bars above a panelled stall riser and a plain fascia ornamented with squirrels in relief. Above it is a continuous foliate frieze enriched with shields.\r\rINTERIOR: an open well stair at the rear of the building has square newels and a rectilinear balustrade. It is lit by a large window enriched with stained glass which commemorates the crowning of the Saxon kings in Kingston, flanked by civic emblems and shields. Elsewhere stained glass panels commemorate past monarchs and civic dignitaries.\r\rNeighbour notification - no response received  \r\rKTCAAC - object on grounds of the method of illumination and positioning. \r\rRelevant History\r19/02031/ADV - Display of non illuminated fascia signage and new hanging sign.

The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity \r\rThe signage would be located on the front of the building. The site fronts the Market Place. \r\rThe building occupies a prominent position in townscape. The fascia signage would consist of internally illuminated individual large aluminium letters above the shop entrance. The awnings would have bold large lettering displayed on them. It is considered that the signage proposed would be not be sympathetic to the host property and would by virtue of its design and illumination be an incongruous addition to the host porperty that would be visually intursive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property. It is considered that the fascia sign and the signage on the awnings would create visual clutter as a result of their design. It is considered that the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the area which forms part of the designated heritage asset, the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and would detract from the special architectural integrity of the statutorily listed building causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage assets.  \r \rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would not accord with sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 195 - 214 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of rear and side dormer roof extensions with installation of front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration to first floor side fenestration.\r\rConsultation\r15 Neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Privacy\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. When designing a roof extension it is important to ensure that the addition of a dormer window complements the original design of the house (particularly the roof form). In many cases, it should be possible to design dormer windows so that they allow the conversion of a loft space, but do not dominate the form of the existing roof.\r\rThis is particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area.\r\rOfficers note that there are no other examples of this type of development within the surrounding streetscene. It is also noted that the site faces two locally listed buildings of townscape merit (non-designated heritage assets) and although this side of the road falls outside of the Cadogan Road Conservation Area, any works to the property would require the impact of this development on this heritage asset.\r\rWith regards to the proposed rear dormer, it is noted that the proposed dormer would also not comply with Policy Guidance 39 of the Residentail design SPD which requires the proposed dormers to be designed so that they are set down from the\rridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm, set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm and are designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area and match or line-up with any original windows below.\r\rIt is also noted that the proposed roof extension would not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) as flats do not benefit from permitted\rdevelopment rights.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would cause harm to the character and appearance of the existing site and the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner.

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r5 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a two storey rear infill extension with internal alterations.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises terrace  dwelling.  \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a two storey rear infill extension with internal alterations.  to demolish an existing garage and the erection of a single storey side extension to match the size of existing. \r\rThe existing rear elevation wall at ground floor level is slightly stepped in terms of the established building line. At first floor level, the  dwelling presents an external void space   with an existing window  on the rear elevation.\r\rThe proposal seeks to remove part of the external kitchen wall on the rear elevation  to be reconstructed  and be in alignment  with the retained  existing rear elevation wall.  A new rear patio door would be presented.  At first floor level, the proposal seeks to infill the existing void space creating additional floorspace and present a single window on the new rear elevation wall which would be in alignment with the existing built form. A flat roof is proposed for the infill and a parapet wall and box gutter installed  adjoining no 22 Cleveland Road. \r\rIn terms of proposed materials and finishes,  the walls would have a render finish and the upvc window installed at first floor level.  Officers note the neighbouring gutter is to be removed and fixed into a new gutter and downpipe.  \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the forest floor infill and alterations to the rear elevation wall, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rOverall the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the characters or appearance of the areas as a result of the proposals. \r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing garage and erection of single storey side and rear extension with internal alterations. Changes to fenestrations.\r\rConsultations\r13 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Highways; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey side extension would not be set back from the front elevation, however it would follow the existing front building line. Given the proposed roof design, its siting (the application site is located on a corner plot) and the proposed materials is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would replace the existing one and it would be of similar depth of approximately 2.4m. Due to the proposed design and materials it is considered to appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character\rwhich is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the existing garage due to its size (approximately 5.3m x 2.3m) is not suitable for car parking purposes. The applicant has declared on the application form that there are no existing or proposed on site car parking facilities. It is noted that the application site is not located within the controlled parking zone. As such, it is considered that in this case, there would be no significant impact on the local highway network as a result of the proposal. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space or the proposed garage/gym to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

However, considering its eaves height of approximately 3m, the proposed design and its siting, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed extension would not be visible within the street view, therefore there will be no impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

It would present a flat roof with an eaves height of 2.8m accommodating a single rooflight.  In terms of proposed materials and finishes the walls would be rendered, french double doors on the rear elevation and the flat roof  would be covered in mineral felt.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the depth of the proposed  single storey extension would not comply with the Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD which recommends a total depth of 3.5m for terrace dwellings. In the context of the application site  being an end of terrace,  the single storey rear extension is considered acceptable . \r\rThe application also seeks approval for a first floor rear extension which would project a depth of 3m,  width of 5.56m and  be positioned within the built footprint of the ground floor extension.

The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer Comment: The approved scheme comprises the following materials: light timber cladding applied horizontally and vertically to provide visually interesting appearance, spray coated aluminium windows and spray coated aluminium and timber doors and green roofs. \r\rOffices raise concerns about the proposed sample of cladding, it has not been demonstrated that in connection with the proposed windows it would not appear too dark, it is also unclear how it would provide the required visual effect when applied horizontally and vertically. Furthermore the submitted 'Mood Board' shows Figure 1-2 Siberian Larch Stained Grey with Fire Proofing, it is unclear where it would be applied.\r\rWith regards to the proposed windows shown on the 'Mood Board', while the proposed aluminium windows would be supported in principle, the exact details of the proposed windows including colour/materiality/full manufacturer details must be provided. \r\rThe introduction of zinc cladding at this stage would not be supported as the approved drawings show light timber cladding. \r\rManufacturer details for proposed doors (all types), green roof and balconies are required. \r\rWith regards to the details of the proposed porch, they are unlikely to be supported as the original design was for very slim and fine canopies, an alternative should be provided for the porch canopy as well as the canopies over balconies. \r\rOverall, the submitted details are considered to be inadequate and insufficient to discharge Condition 4. The applicant should provide details for specific products (including material/colour/full manufacturer details) and indicate on elevation drawings where these materials would be applied. \r\rCondition 5 (construction management plan) of planning permission 22/01233/FUL states:\rNo development shall take place (including any works of demolition) until a construction management plan or construction method statement has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved plan/statement shall be adhered to throughout the construction period. The statement shall provide for:\r\ri) How the proposed development will be built;\rii) Hours of working (which shall be limited to 08.00 to 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 to 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays);\riii) The procedure for loading/unloading materials;\riv) The route to and away from site for muck away and vehicles with materials;\rv) The protocol for managing deliveries to one vehicle at a time on sites with restricted access or space;\rvi) The protocol for managing vehicles that need to wait for access to the site; \rvii) Whether any reversing manoeuvres are required onto or off the public highway into the site and whether a banksman will be provided;\rviii) Temporary site access;\rix) Signing system for works traffic;\rx) Whether site access warning signs will be required in adjacent roads;\rxi) Whether it is anticipated that statutory undertaker connections will be required into the site;\rxii) The storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles;\rxiii) The potential for impacts from dust and emissions during the demolition and/or construction phase upon local air quality and surrounding residents;\rxiv) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works;\rxv) The location of all ancillary site buildings;\rxvi) The means of enclosure of the site, its erection and maintenance;\rxvii) Wheel washing equipment;\rxviii) The parking of vehicles of site operatives and visitors;\rxix) Meeting the requirements of the Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile Machinery (where relevant plant or vehicles are being used); and\rxx) The method of recycling and disposing of waste resulting from the demolition and/or construction phases\r\rDeliveries/collections to and from the site shall use a route that is agreed with the highway authority and the agreed route shall be signed accordingly.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS7, DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis condition must be a pre-commencement condition in order to be effective.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that the RBK's Environmental Health Officer raised no objections with regards to information submitted for Condition 5. \r\rThe RBK's Highway Engineer offered the following comments: (...) The submitted CMP for the proposed development covers the key requirements to discharge Condition 5 of the planning application consent and is considered acceptable. \r\rA few details need to be addressed. The plan was titled Construction Traffic Management Plan instead of \"Construction Management Plan and made references to the Ashford Borough Council in para. 1.3 and Surrey County Council in para 7.2, instead of RBK. These anomalies should be corrected in the plan by the applicant.\r\rThe applicant is advised to amend the submitted information as instructed above. \r\rCondition 12 (detailed drainage design) of planning permission 22/01233/FUL states:\rPrior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), a final detailed drainage design, including drawings, supporting calculations, SuDS Statement and Drainage Assessment Form shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components must also be submitted to demonstrate how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The system shall be implemented and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r \rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021, the Sustainable Design and Construction SPG 2014, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems 2015 and policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer Comment: The RBK's Flood Risk Officer objects to the submitted information in relation to condition 12:\rThe proposals include the demolition of existing buildings and erection of 6 x terrace houses with associated parking, amenity space, individual sheds, cycle stores and refuse/recycling facilities.\r\rThe Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) provided by the Environment Agency shows that the site lies in an area of very low risk of surface water flooding (meaning there is less than 0.1% likelihood of flooding occurring in a given year). An online version of this mapping data is available to view through the Environment Agency's Long term flood risk information mapping.\r\rThe applicant was required to provide a final detailed drainage design, including drawings, supporting calculations, SuDS Statement, a Drainage Assessment Form and a detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components.\r\rFor the discharge of this condition, the applicant has provided a management plan to confirm the maintenance tasks, frequency and maintenance owner of the proposed drainage system to be LH Developments Ltd.\r\rA drainage layout has been provided to show the locations and connectivity of the drainage system. The layout as required shows the pipe numbers, gradient and pipe sizes and the connectivity until the point of discharge. However, the invert levels of the final discharge point need to be clarified as different datum references are being used. It is stated in the submitted drainage layout that \"Contractor to confirm IL of existing run, prior to start of any works''. This needs to be confirmed to demonstrate the viability of the scheme, as all drawings need to be marked as final.\r\rInsufficient information regarding a surface water runoff scheme has been submitted. A drainage strategy compliant with the drainage hierarchy with supporting calculations has not been provided as required by the condition. Drainage calculations to demonstrate that the proposed drainage system can contain up to the 1 in 30 storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event can be safely contained on site should be provided to demonstrate that the site aligns with industry standards. These calculations must include details of critical storm durations and demonstrate how the proposed system as a whole will function during different storm events. Drainage calculations should include all areas that contribute to the drainage system, including soft landscaping areas that contribute to the drainage system.\r\rThe LLFA does not recommend the discharge of condition 12. We do not recommend the\rdischarge of this condition because more information is required to support the discharge of this condition. The invert level of the proposed discharge point needs to be clarified and confirmed and all drawings need to be marked as final. Finally, drainage calculations should be provided to support the drainage strategy.\r\rAdditional and revised information is required to discharge Condition 12.\r\rCondition 15 (arboricultural method statement) of planning permission 22/01233/FUL states:\rPrior to commencement of the development (including any works of demolition), a detailed arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of conservatory and erection of single storey rear and first floor side extensions\r\rConsultation\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension has been set in from the front elevation and boundary and down from the original roof ridge in line with Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential design SPD. Officers also note that a number of properties within the area have been extended to side at first floor in the same manner as the proposed. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that No. 437 Ewell Road benefits from a single storey rear extension. Due to the existing situation between No. 437 Ewell Road and No. 439 Ewell, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site is a commercial unit located on the north side of Market Place in the designated Kingston Town Centre and the Kingston Old Town Conservation a designated heritage asset. The building is also a statutorily listed Grade II building. \r\rListing detail \rLocation\rStatutory Address:\r15 and 16 Market Place, Kingston upon Thames, KT1 1JP\rThe building or site itself may lie within the boundary of more than one authority.\r\rCounty:\rGreater London Authority\rDistrict:\rKingston upon Thames (London Borough)\rParish:\rNon Civil Parish\rNational Grid Reference:\rTQ 17879 69257\rSummary\rShop 1909, for Boots the Chemists by their architect M V Treleaven; extended 1929 by Percy J Bartlett. Sculpted figures probably by Gilbert Searle & Son.\r\rReasons for Designation\rNos.15 and 16 Market Place, formerly Boots the Chemists, designed by their architect M V Treleaven, and extended 1929 by Percy J Bartlett, are listed at Grade II for the following principal reasons:\r\r* Architectural interest: a handsome early C20 shop facade, typical of Boots house style in its Jacobean Revival manner and depiction of local events of importance, in this case the crowning of the Saxon kings in Kingston;\r\r* Fixtures and fittings: the exterior is adorned with statuary and memorial cartouches while the impressive stained glass stair window also commemorates the crowning of the Saxon kings;\r\r* Group value: it stands prominently at the head of the historic Market Square and its rich diversity of buildings, adjacent to the Grade I listed parish church and Grade II* listed Market House.\r\rHistory\rKingston upon Thames, historically in Surrey, was an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period, while there is evidence of Saxon settlement and of activity dating from the prehistoric period and of Roman occupation. It is close to the important historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park, Richmond and Richmond Park. The old core of the town, around All Saints Church (C14 and C15, on an earlier site) and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is 'the best preserved of its type in outer London' (Pevsner and Cherry, London: South, 1983 p. 307). Kingston thrived first as an agricultural and market town and on its historic industries of malting, brewing and tanning, salmon fishing and timber exporting, before expanding rapidly as a suburb after the arrival of the railway in the 1860s. In the later C19 it become a centre of local government, and in the early C20 became an important shopping and commercial centre. Its rich diversity of buildings and structures from all periods reflect the multi-facetted development of the town. \r\rThe shop occupies two plots at the head of the historic Market Place, and is a replacement, or at least a re-fronting of its predecessor which was built in 1880. It was built by Boots, the Chemists, in 1909 by their architect M V Treleaven, although the design of the façade has also been attributed to Dr William Finney, antiquarian and seven times mayor of Kingston. An inscribed cartouche records that the ancient title of Royal Borough was conferred on the town by King George V in 1927. Perhaps in consequence, the right hand bay was added in 1929 by the architect Percy J Bartlett, echoing the original theme. The originally symmetrical shop front was rearranged to place the new entrance centrally in the enlarged building, beneath a new fascia.\r\rThe shop is one of approximately 16 black and white mock timber framed stores built by Boots between 1903 and 1914, as it were in a house style. Most of them were designed by A N Bromley, though M V Treleaven may have developed the original concept and was certain responsible for two of the early stores (Kings Lynn, 1903 and Winchester, 1905). Typically they commemorate locally important historic figures or events, for example in Derby including Florence Nightingale and in Bury St Edmunds, Canute. In Kingston the shop commemorates the crowning of the Saxon kings. The sculpted figures of the monarchs are probably by Gilbert Searle & Son.\r\rDetails\rShop 1909, for Boots the Chemists by their architect M V Treleaven; extended 1929 by Percy J Bartlett. Sculpted figures probably by Gilbert Searle & Son.\r\rMATERIALS: brick and timber frame, the façade in stucco, with applied timber framing, stone dressings and statuary. Plain tile roofs.\r\rPLAN: purpose-built shop in three bays and four storeys. The original shop occupied the narrower central and left hand bays of the current building and had a symmetrical shop front with a central entrance. When the building was extended by a bay to the right the ground floor shop front was redesigned to create a central entrance. The upper floors of the new wing echo the original design which was adapted slightly to accommodate the extension.\r\rEXTERIOR: is in three gabled bays with first and second floor oriel windows and smaller canted bay windows on the upper floor. Windows have moulded timber cross casements with diamond leaded lights beneath bracketed cornices. Below the second floor windows are coats of arms and insignia. The gables are timber framed with ornate bargeboards and finials. Between each bay is a vertical panel enriched with sculpted figures beneath cusped canopies and with low relief cartouches and heraldic emblems. To the left the figures depict Edward the Elder and Henry; framing the central bay are Edward III and Elizabeth and to the right Althelstan and John.\r\rAt first floor level an inscribed panel records that NEAR THIS SPOT WERE CROWNED THE FOLLOWING KINGS / CROWNED AD / EDWARD the Elder 902 / ATHELSTAN 924 / EDMUND 940 / EDRED 946 / EDWY 955 / EDWARD the Martyr 975 / ETHELRED 979\r\rAdjacent to it a moulded panel is inscribed THE / ROYAL BOROUGH/ OF / KINGSTON UPON / THAMES / In 1927 / THE ANCIENT TITLE / OF / ROYAL BOROUGH / WAS / CONFIRMED / TO KINGSTON BY / KING GEORGE V The shop front, has slender glazing bars above a panelled stall riser and a plain fascia ornamented with squirrels in relief. Above it is a continuous foliate frieze enriched with shields.\r\rINTERIOR: an open well stair at the rear of the building has square newels and a rectilinear balustrade. It is lit by a large window enriched with stained glass which commemorates the crowning of the Saxon kings in Kingston, flanked by civic emblems and shields. Elsewhere stained glass panels commemorate past monarchs and civic dignitaries.\r\rNeighbour notification - no response received  \r\rKTCAAC - object on grounds of siting and method of illumination. \r\rRelevant History\r16/12227/ADV - Display of externally illuminated fascia letters and internal window graphics - Granted 10.05.2016\r\r16/12241/LBC - Display of externally illuminated fascia letters and internal window graphics. - Granted 10.05.2016\r\rProposal \rDisplay of 2 x non-illuminated fascia signs and 1 x non-illuminated projecting sign\r\rA separate listed building application has been submitted in tandem, reference 24/00452/LBC\r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity \r\rThe signage would be located on the front and rear of the building. The site fronts Thames Street on the edge of the Market Place and at the rear faces onto the Kingston riverside and towpath. \r\rThe building occupies a prominent position in both the street and riverscape. The signage consisting of mounted individual non illuminated lettering is considered to be of a style and material finish that is not of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property.  It is considered that the signage proposed would be out of keeping with the type of signage elsewhere in the conservation area. The acrylic finish is considered to be unsympathetic to the existing external finishes of the building and the signage would be visually intrusive and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property. Overall it is considered that the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the area which forms part of the designated heritage asset, the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and would detract from the special architectural integrity of the statutorily listed building causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage assets.  \r\rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would not accord with sections 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 195 - 214 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r",

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non material amendment to planning permission ref. no 23/03289/FUL to change of material on side elevation at loft level from slate to brick to match existing.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the changes are considered to be non-material.",
