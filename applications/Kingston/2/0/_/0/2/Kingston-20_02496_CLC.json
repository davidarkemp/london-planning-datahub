    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located approximately 14m away from the Grade II listed building Malden Green Farmhouse.  \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of shed and erection of two storey rear extension. Erection of new shed to front of site. Associated landscaping works.\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \rThe Council's Heritage and Conservation Officer - objects to the proposal. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on designated Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey rear extension would measure approximately 5.3m in depth and have a  total height of approximately 6.2m. It would feature a cantilever extension to the side that would be visible from the front and would include a single storey rear extension finished with a flat roof. The contemporary design of the proposed extension and introduction of modern materials (zinc for the main roof) are noted.\r\rWith regards to the proposed mass and bulk of the extension, Policy Guidance 34 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that the two storey rear extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between the boundaries and adjacent dwelling. In this case the proposed extension would be set along the north-west boundary and would retain small separation distances to the other common boundaries. While it is noted that the proposed single storey rear element of the proposal was designed to minimise the scale of the extension, the proposed extension would still appear as a dominant addition that is not in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.  \r\rFurthermore, due to the proposed roof design that is not in-keeping with the existing roof forms of the dwelling and the introduction of a new material (zinc) for the roof, the proposed mass and bulk would be much more emphasised by such design choices, especially when viewed from Lower Green Gardens. \r\rWhile use of contemporary design  and modern materials can be a positive aspect of a design, it can also be visually jarring and harmful if it does not relate well to the character of the surrounding area like in this case.\r\rIt is noted that the applications site is located approximately 14m away from the Grade II listed building, Malden Green Farmhouse. The character and appearance of the application site, which is distinctively different from the other adjoining properties and clearly relates to Malden Green Farmhouse and forms its setting. \r\rThe existing materials on the host dwelling and the adjoining properties, especially at Malden Green Mews are similar and traditional. Those properties are located close to Malden Green Farm and form an 'open plan' area and setting of the listed building. \r\rIt has not been demonstrated that the proposed contemporary  design of the extension, the proposed roof form and zinc roof as well as introduction of contrasting cladding would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed erection of a garden shed to the front is considered to be acceptable from the character and appearance perspective.\r\rWith regards to the proposed installation of the solar panels to the rear, limited information has been submitted with regards to their appearance and level of protrusion from the roof slope. Given the proposed roof design and the proposed roof material, addition of solar panels could add and emphasise  the proposed mass and bulk of the extension that would be directly visible within Lower Green Gardens. \r\rThe proposed installation of an electric charging point and alterations to fenestration to the front elevation are considered to be acceptable.\r\rImpact on designated Heritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 199 of NPPF 2021 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r\rParagraph 194 states that In determining applications, local planning authorities should require an applicant to describe the significance of any heritage assets affected, including any contribution made by their setting. The level of detail should be proportionate to the assets' importance and no more than is sufficient to understand the potential impact of the\rproposal on their significance. As a minimum the relevant historic environment record should have been consulted and the heritage assets assessed using appropriate expertise where necessary. \r\rParagraph 195 of NPPF states that local planning authorities should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset that may be affected by a proposal (including by development affecting the setting of a heritage asset) taking account of the available evidence and any necessary expertise. They should take this into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise any conflict between the heritage asset's conservation and any aspect of the proposal.\r\rParagraph 202 of NPPF 2021 states that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rThe Malden Green Farmhouse is a Grade 2 listed building with the following details in the List Entry: \r\r\"C17 and earlier, with later alterations. 2 storeys. L shaped. Brick, stuccoed. Gable to road with wide end chimney with off sets. One gable end. Tile roof. Windows altered (now segment headed C18). Good closed string staircase and internal beams\" \r\rThe application site forms part of the setting of Malden Green Farmhouse, and together originally formed part of Malden Green Farm, hence its distinctive character and appearance. Its existing form, design and materiality is in a clear relationship with Malden Green Farmhouse, with its original use as an agricultural building, and therefore contributes to its historic and architectural significance\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed extension due to its siting would not be directly visible when viewing the primary southeastern elevations of Malden Green Farmhouse directly from the access approach off Malden Road, however it still forms part of the  setting visible in the round, including public vantage points: Malden Green Mews and Lower Green Gardens.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension due to its massing, scale and materials is not considered to appear as a subordinate or sensitive feature to the setting of the listed building that would preserve or enhance its significance.\r\rAs per Paragraph 202 of the NPPF, 2021, there would be no mitigating public benefits associated with the proposal with only limited, private benefits afforded from the proposed  extension.\r\rThe Council's Heritage and Conservation Officer has raised objections to the overall design (primarily, the scale, massing and appearance) of the extension which is considered inappropriate and affecting the setting of the listed building in a way that is harmful to its significance. \r\rHaving regard to the above,  it is considered, that the scale, massing and appearance of the proposed two storey rear extension and the introduction of zinc roof and contrasting cladding that would emphasise the shape and form of the extension, would detract from the setting of the designated Grade-II listed building,  Malden Green Farmhouse and would result in less than substantial harm to its significance. As such the proposal is not considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. No public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm. As such, the proposal is contrary to Paragraphs 195 - 202 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8 and  DM12 of the Core Strategy 2012 .\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed openings above the ground floor level to the side, north-east, elevation would be obscure glazed and non openable below 1.7m from the floor level details of which would be secured via conditions to ensure no adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers at the adjoining properties on Lower Green Gardens. \r\rThe proposed window to the side, north- west elevation at the first floor, given its size and siting is not considered to result in an undue overlooking in relation to the properties at Malden Green Mews.  \r\rThe window to the first floor at the rear elevation, due to its siting, would not directly overlook the adjoining playground. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on the trees\rIt is noted that the existing trees within the application site are not subject to Tree \rPreservation Order and they are not situated within a conservation area.\r\rThe proposal would include removal of several 'category C' trees and appropriate replanting as per submitted Arboricultural Report, Tree Constraints Plan and Impact Assessment.\r\rThe Council's Tree Officer raised no objections to the proposal.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
