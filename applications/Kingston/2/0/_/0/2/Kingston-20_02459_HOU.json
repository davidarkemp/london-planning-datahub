    "The proposed part single part two storey side extension, by reason of its siting, massing and inadequate separation distance from the shared boundary, would fail to be a subordinate and proportionate addition to the main dwelling and would unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in an incongruous appearance from the street and unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
