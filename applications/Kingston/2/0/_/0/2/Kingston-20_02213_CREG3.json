    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached, locally listed dwelling located within the Claremont Road Conservation Area.  The trees situated with the application site are protected.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing outbuilding garage, erection of part two store/part single storey side and rear extension. Fenestration alteration. Erection of a timber gate, boundary wall and landscaping.\r\rConsultations\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Areas advisory Committee - no objections subject to the matching materials. \r\rTree Officer - no objections to the proposal\r\rRepresentations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inappropriate design/layout; the proposal alterations to the original building would be harmful to the building's original features. \r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed within this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Highways\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The current application is a resubmission of approved scheme ref 20/01474/HOU for 'Erection of part single and part two storey side and rear extensions (following demolition of rear extensions and garage); replacement windows and erection of new boundary walls and gates to front' granted on 04.09.2020.\r\rOfficers note the concerns received within the written representations regarding the potential loss of the original house features (such as blind window and the original windows), however, considering the proposed design and high quality materials, it is considered that the proposed alterations would appear sympathetic to the design of the existing house.\r\rWhile the proposed depth of the two storey side extension would exceed half of the width of the original house, given the sitting of the proposal, the set down from the existing roof ridge, significant setback from the front elevation and irregular shape of the plot, the proposal would appear as a subordinate addition to the host dwelling. As it would not be readily visible from Adelaide Road, it would not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site comprises a locally listed building and is located within the Claremont Road Conservation Area.  The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as 'Part of the original Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley. Development started in 1838, and centred around the landscaped Claremont Crescent Gardens'. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal is sympathetic to the design of the existing building insofar as it appears to replicate many of the architectural features of the existing dwelling and boundary treatments. However, it is acknowledged that the extensions would somewhat upset the balance of the property and its adjoining semi-detached neighbour, they would be relatively well hidden by the boundary wall and vegetation at the front of the site and would be set far enough back from the front wall of the property that they would clearly read as subordinate extensions and, in officers view, would not affect the ability to appreciate the significance of the existing part of the property. \r\rThe above assessment is heavily reliant on suitable detailed design, particularly regarding the quality of facing materials used and the arrangement of the windows, which should be secured by conditions. Subject to these conditions, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in harm to the significance of either the Claremont Road Conservation Area or the locally listed application property.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rA relevant condition would be added for any new windows above the ground floor level in the south-eastern elevation to be obscure glazed and non openable below 1.7 when measured from the floor level. \r\rHighways\r\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rThe proposed alterations to the boundary treatments would involve the widening of the gateway, which would improve visibility, whilst making no changes to the crossover itself. Therefore the proposal would comply with Policies DM9 and DM10.\r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe applicant has submitted the Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan demonstrating that the existing trees would not be adversely affected as a result of the proposal. As such this aspect of the proposal is considered to be acceptable subject to a condition securing compliance of the proposal with the submitted arboricultural information. \r\rIt is noted that the Council's Tree Officer raised no objections to the proposal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within The Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear, first floor rear and rear roof extensions. Erection of 1no. rear and 2nos. side dormer roof extensions and installation of 1no. rear rooflight. Window replacement and alterations to the front and rear fenestrations.\r\rIt is noted that this application follows previously approved application 23/02817/HOU dated 06.12.2023 for the erection of single storey rear, first floor rear and rear roof extensions. Erection of 1no. rear and 2nos. side dormer roof extensions and installation of 1no. rear rooflight. Window replacement and alterations to the front and rear fenestrations. \r\rThere is no change to the description but an amendment to the proposed fenestration to be used. The applicant would use the same windows as approved but the colour proposed would now be black to match the colour of the windows approved to the rear of the property.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The replacement of windows would be Timber-effect uPVC black windows in Georgian style with astragal bars to match windows to the rear. Officers note that black windows have also been approved at the neighbouring property Elmwood so is becoming a feature within the area. No harm has therefore been identified by the change in colour. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and therefore, no adverse impacts on The Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the existing siting of the property in relation to its adjoining neighbours no harm has been identified in relation to loss of daylight or sunlight. It has also been demonstrated that the proposed extensions would comply with BRE Guidance. In relation to loss of privacy, officers note the introduction of further windows to the southern flank elevation. Should permission be granted obscured glazing and opening restrictions would be secured by condition. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment:  The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner.

    "\r\r--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r11 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. 1no  letters of representation were received in support of the proposal.\r\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  cladding of rear and part ground floor side elevations, garage outbuilding and inward face of garden walls in grey brick slips.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises  detached dwelling. \r\rThe application site  resides within Woodside Road/ Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety \r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for cladding of the rear and part ground floor side elevations of the existing dwelling, garage outbuilding and inward face of garden walls in grey brickslips. \r\rThe  existing walls of the dwelling  and garage outbuilding are white rendered.  The proposal seeks to clad both the rear and part ground floor side elevations of the  existing dwelling  as well as the front elevation and side elevations of the existing summerhouse  in  Petersen Tegl D98 grey brick slips. In addition, it is proposed that the inward face of the garden walls will also be clad in Petersen Tegl D98 brick slips. Officers have been presented with a physical sample of Petersen Tegl brick slip.  \r\rThe proposed cladding would be visible  above the existing white render site boundary wall and therefore visible from the  streetscene,  primarily from Eastbury Road. Based on the  proposed scale  of the cladding together with the  neutral colour of the brick, it is considered that the proposal would be complimentary  in the context of the  existing  modern buildings on the application site together nor in terms of the immediate surroundings.  Therefore, it is considered that the proposal would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 195 to 208 of the NPPF (December 2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application site falls within  Woodside Road/ Eastbury Road  Local Area of Special Character,  a non designated heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would  not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would harm the significance of the  Woodside Road/ Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners.

It is considered they would be in keeping with the existing lighting columns on site and due to their proximity to the boundary would have a reduced height in comparison to the existing light columns so as to minimise their visual impact and would be absorbed into the back drop of the site and existing lighting columns.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers note the application is supported by a lighting assessment.  The LED illumination would reduce light spillage on the site to the surrounding area and the illuminance levels are considered acceptable in that they would not cause demonstrable light pollution and would not cause undue harm to the existing living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rOther matters \rThe application is supported by a Bat survey. It is considered that the proposal would not result in harm to the local or wider bat population as a result of the proposal subject to suitable control of lighting by conditions. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would result in the longer provision of sporting activity a community benefit and it is considered that the proposal would be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r2 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of garage and single storey rear extension and erection of a two storey side and single storey rear extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r23/03434/HOU - Demolition of garage and rear extension and erection of single storey rear/side extension. Granted 06.03.24\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to demolish an existing garage and rear extensions and the erection of a two storey side and single storey rear extension.\r\rThe dwelling presents an existing single storey rear extension which projects a depth of approximately 3m. Overall, the proposed rear extension would project a depth of 6m resulting in a new rear building line which would be in alignment with the existing rear extension at neighbouring no 82 Tolworth Rise South. The proposed rear extension would have a parapet flat roof with a height of 3m. The proposed rear elevation would present a single window and patio doors.  Considering the size of the plot, the proposed rear extension is deemed acceptable.\r\rThe existing building line of the garage projects forward of the porch. The proposed two storey side extension would be positioned to present a new front building line  at ground level which would be in alignment with the porch.  At first floor level, the proposed side extension would be set back by 1m from the existing front elevation of the dwelling and be positioned within the built footprint of the proposed ground floor side  extension to the extent of the rear elevation of the original dwelling. The proposed rear elevation of the side extension at first floor level would present a single window. \r\rPolicy Guidance 36 in the Residential Design SPD recommends that two storey side and first floor side extensions  should normally be set  back by at least 500mm from the front of the house. In this instance, at ground floor level the proposed side extension is not set back from the front wall of the original house, however Officers note there are similar examples to the proposed arrangement along Tolworth South Rise and therefore would be considered acceptable. However, the set back of the proposed first floor extension would be compliant with the Policy Guidance.\r\rThe proposed side elevation facing towards no 78 Tolworth South Road at ground level would present two obscured upvc windows and a single door. No fenestration is proposed at first floor level. \r\rOfficers also note the introduction of a single aspect pitch tiled roof at ground level.  The proposed  hipped roof would present a roof line set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm and the line of the roof's eaves run with that of the original dwelling . It is considered that the proposed roof of the side extension is considered to reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form. \r\rThe width of the shared alleyway between nos 80 and 78 would remain the same. Beyond this point, an infill side extension is proposed extending to the existing rear wall of the dwelling followed by the proposed rear extension. The separation distance between the new building and the shared site boundary with neighbouring no78 would be reduced to measure 0.38m.\r\rIn terms of proposed materials and finishes these include rendered walls and tiled roof  to match existing and introduction of upvc windows to match existing.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy plans  in terms of proposed block plan and site plan together with a Planning Fire Safety Strategy Plan for first floor level.These have been accompanied by a Reasonable Exception Statement .  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \rNo response received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would not follow the guiding principles of the LPA's Residential Design SPD. However in this instance in the context of the site and its surroundings it is considered that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would not have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\rIt is noted that the proposal is supported by a fire safety statement however it is considered that this does not fully address each criteria of Policy D12 of the London Plan. A condition is recommended to require the submission of a detailed fire safety strategy that addresses in full the criteria of Policy D12 of the London Plan to ensure that the proposed development would indeed comply with the policy. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of existing garage into habitable space, erection of single storey front, side and rear extension\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on Parking; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to character and appearance, officers note that the pair of semi detached properties are already unbalanced due to the first floor side extension at No. 31 Dickarage Road. It is also noted that there are a number of garage conversions and various front porches within the streetscene. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building, extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth but If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased. \r\rIt is noted that No. 31 benefits from a single storey rear extension and there are also examples of larger rear extensions along the road. Although No. 35 Dickerage Road does currently benefit from a rear extension it does not extend to the same depth across the full width of the rear.  From the planning history on this site it is clear that the windows nearest No. 33 Dickerage Road at ground floor level services the kitchen which is considered a non habitable room. The applicant has also demonstrated on the submitted plans that the proposed extension to the rear of No .33 Dickerage would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to this window.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. Access to the rear garden will be maintained so a condition requiring provision of cycle storage will not be required.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of existing garage into habitable space. Erection of single storey rear, side and front extensions and part first floor/part two storey side extension.\r\rIt is noted that this application follows a previously approved application 23/01991/HOU dated 21.11.2023 for the conversion of existing garage into habitable space, erection of single storey front, side and rear extension. The new application also proposes a part first floor/part two storey side extension \r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on Parking; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to character and appearance, officers note that the pair of semi detached properties are already unbalanced due to the first floor side extension at No. 31 Dickarage Road. The proposed first floor side extension would re-balance the pair of semi detached dwellings whilst maintaing the charater of the catslide roof. It is also noted that there are a number of garage conversions and various front porches within the streetscene. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

From the planning history on this site it is clear that the windows nearest No. 33 Dickerage Road at ground floor level services the kitchen which is considered a non habitable room. The applicant has also demonstrated on the submitted plans that the proposed extension to the rear of No .33 Dickerage would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to this window. With regards to the proposed 1st floor rear extension, officers note this would infil the area between the existing first floor outrigger and the new first floor side extension. As no further depth has been added to the existing outrigger it is considered there would not be a greater loss of light to the rear first floor windows of No. 33 Dickerage Road. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear/side extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rThe application site is within a  Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character and within Flood Zone 2 & 3.\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Flood Risk\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks the erection of a single storey rear/ side extension. \r\rThe existing dwelling presents a part two storey/ part single storey outrigger which measures a depth of 6.545m from the rear elevation of the original dwelling and a width of 2.447m. The existing storey element  presents a single aspect pitch tiled roof with a parapet height of 3.658m and eaves height of 2.362m. It is proposed that the proposed roof would be a green roof and accommodate 3 roof lights. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear and side extension would project a maximum depth of 7.7m  and a width of 4.699m. It would  exceed the width of the original dwelling and be positioned hard against the shared boundary with no 77 Portland Road. It would present a flat roof eaves height of 3m The parapet feature between no73 and No75 Portland Road would remain in place.\r\rThe proposed side elevation  of the extension facing towards no 77  would present a flank wall  and the rear elevation would present aluminium sliding doors.  The proposed extension itself would be constructed from London Stock brickwork. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side and rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property  to consider in relation to amenity  is the immediate neighbouring property at no 77 Portland Road. \r\rThe proposed side elevation of the extension would present a flank wall. Even though the separation distance between the neighbouring properties would be reduced, adequate separation distance remains in situ.   \r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 195 to 208 of the NPPF (December 2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application site falls within  Grove Lane  Local Area of Special Character,  a non designated heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would  not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would harm the significance of the   Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character. \r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2/3. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rAddition to the existing extension to make total rear extension of 5.5m from the rear wall of the original property  and a maximum total height of 3.00m from NSL\r\rConsultations\r3 properties were notified of the proposal. One representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Increased sense of enclosure \r\rThe above concerns will be addressed within this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site benefits from a staggered rear extension that is approximately 2.8m deep along the common boundary with No 70.\r\rThe proposed single storey, full width rear extension would be of a total depth of approximately 5.55m and total height of approximately 3m. The proposed separation distance to the common boundary with No 70 would be similar to the existing, approximately 10cm. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth up to 3.5m for semi detached properties. However, it is noted that the proposed depth is not uncharacteristic to the area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note objections raised within the written representations that the proposal may significantly reduce the level of daylight received by the adjoining property, appear as an overbearing and increase sense of enclosure. \r\rGiven the proposed height of the extension and its siting, it would pass the 45 degree rule in elevation view and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the closest habitable, ground floor window at No 70. \r\rHowever as the proposal would be set along the boundary with No 70, which shows its original, staggered layout, it is considered that the proposal due to its excessive scale and siting it would appear as an overbearing and it would create a sense of enclosure in relation to the nearest, principle window at the ground floor level at this adjoining property. \r\rIt is noted that properties benefit from relatively narrow gardens and no mature vegetation along the boundaries to mitigate any impacts. \r\rGiven the above, it is considered that the proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth and siting, would appear as an overbearing when viewed from No 70 Grand Avenue and it would increase a sense of enclosure, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for occupants at No 70. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of two storey side and part two storey/part single storey rear extension. Erection of single storey front porch and first floor front bay window extension.\r\rIt is noted that the same proposal was submitted and approved under application 07/12660/FUL dated 11/07/2007 but was not built out at the time so has been resubmitted now.\r \rConsultation\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Privacy\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that no harm was identifed when the previous application was approved and Officers conclude that the current application would have the same impact. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. To ensure consistancy the same conditions applied with the previos permission will also apply with this permission.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, no harm has been identified subject to the same conditions being applied.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the lack of detail supplied is insufficent. However, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

However, the submitted drawings demonstrate that the piggyback extension would not align with Policy Guidance 40, of the Residential Design SPD. The extension would not maintain 4m or more from the front elevation of the dwelling and it would increase the ridge height by approximately 1.5m, instead of 1.3m, stated in Policy Guidance 40. Therefore, the proposed development would appear overly prominent in the streetscene. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, spacing and design.

However, Officers note the successful application 23/02814/PAEXT for an approximately 6m  deep extension, which is considered a 'fallback' position in this case. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension, due to its width, the proposed design and its siting is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed alterations to the front elevation and conversion of the garage into habitable room are considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposal due to its siting and scale would pass the 45 degree rule and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the adjoining properties. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on South Lane. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rBiodiversity\rWhile Officers note that the proposed development due to its scale has been exempt from biodiversity gain requirements, as per received comments, the application site is situated within an area when swifts (classified as endangered species) occur. \r\rTherefore, a relevant condition would be added for installation of swift bricks or swift boxes at roof level, to promote swift conservation in their area.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a detached family dwelling, pool house and an outbuilding. The site falls within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and is covered by a group Tree Preservation Order.\r\rProposal \rErection of roof extension with side dormer, reduction in roof height, associated changes to fenestrations and restoration of roof apex. (Retrospective)\r\rConsultations\rConservation Areas Advisory Committee - objections to the proposed uPVC windows \r\rRepresentations\r12 properties were notified of the proposal. Two representations have been received with comments summarised as follows:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Privacy\r\rThe above concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alterations to the existing front roof dormer comprising reduction of its height, restoration of the original roof ridge and roof eaves, minimising the width of the top white PVC fascia and replacement of the windows (to be similar in style to the existing windows) are considered acceptable and in-keepin of the host building and the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers note concerns raised within the written representation about the unacceptable  appearance and poor quality of the design. However, it is considered that the proposed alterations that would reduce the overall bulk of the dormer, minimise the appearance of white PVC fascia and improve the style and quality of proposed windows would result in a proportionate and more adequate addition to the host building. \r\rThe proposal would not be visible with Coombe Lane West, therefore there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rIt should be noted that the proposed outbuilding must remain ancillary to the host dwelling and cannot be used as a separate unit of accommodation. Any change of use would require a separate planning application. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site falls within  Coombe Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as The estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed and is considered to be a neutral feature.\r\rAs the proposal would not be visible from the public vantage points and due to its modest scale, the proposed design and materials, it is considered that it would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding, therefore the proposed development would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rOfficers note objections received from a Conservation Area Advisory Committee regarding the proposed windows, however considering that the proposed type, design and material would be of similar appearance to the existing windows, it is considered that this element of the proposal would not result in any harm to the host building and the conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the Coombe Hill Conservation Area or to Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Concerns have been raised that the proposed windows would overlook the habitable windows at the adjoining property. \r\rThe separation distance between the proposed dormer and the rear elevation at No 152 would be approximately 25.50m, in line with Policy Guidance 31 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, that recommends the distances no less than 21m. \r\rHowever, during the site visit the Officer noted that windows would directly face the habitable windows at the first floor in rear elevation at No 152. Therefore a relevant condition would be added for the proposed windows to be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m from the internal floor level. \r\rDue to the separation distance and the proposed design, it is considered that the proposal would not appear as an overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties. Given its siting it would not impact the levels of dayligh recived by the adjoing properties. \r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe applicant submitted an Arbicortual Report to demonstrate no adverse impact on the protected trees. Given that the proposal is limited to the roofline only, it is considered that there would be no significant impact on the existing trees as a result of the proposal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r\rOne objection received. The objection is summarised as follows\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rRelevant history \r\r23/01494/HOU - Erection of single storey rear, front, first floor side and front porch extension. Roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3 nos front roof lights. Refused Appeal Dismissed\r\rProposal \rThe application is a revision of planning application 23/01494/HOU.  The differences are \r- removal of side dormer \r- reduction in depth of single storey rear extension by 500mm along shared side boundary on side of No.57\r- reduction in height of single storey rear extension by 500mm along shared side boundary on side of No.57\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe application is a revision of planning application 23/01494/HOU. The proposal does not follow the guiding principles of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The scheme has been revised to remove the side dormer and reduce the depth and height of the single storey rear extension on the side boundary. This is in response to the Inspector raising these concerns in upholding the LPA's decision. \r\rIt is considered on balance given the range of different extensions of scale and design in the surrounding area, the revisions made to the scheme and the Inspectors commentary in their decision in regards to planning application 23/01494/HOU it is in this instance considered that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal is a revision of planning application 23/01494/HOU. The revisions reduce the depth and height of the single storey rear extension.  It is considered that the proposed development on balance given the reduction in height and depth of the extension by 500mm along shared side boundary on side of No.57 would not result in a loss of daylight/sunlight or outlook that would cause demonstrable harm to the existing living conditions of the existing neighbouring occupiers. It is considered that the proposal would not result in an increase of overlooking of the neighbouring properties or result in a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers. Overall on balance it is considered tha tthe proposal would not cause demonstrable harm to the residential amenities of neighbouring occupiers\r\rOther matters \rA condition is recommended to require the submission of a fire safety strategy to ensure the proposed development would comply with policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r",
