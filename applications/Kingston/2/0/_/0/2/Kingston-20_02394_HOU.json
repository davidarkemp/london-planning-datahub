    "Due to the inadequate separation distance at first floor level and proximity to the shared boundary with No. 8 Orme Road the proposed development would erode the characteristic gaps between semi-detached properties on the street and potentially lead to a terracing effect.  It would also unbalance the symmetry between the application site and No. 12 orme Road, thereby resulting in an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area, contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and paragraph 127 of the NPPF (2019).",
