    "The proposed erection of a rear dormer roof extension (incorporating a Juliet balcony) and the installation of 2no. rooflights to the front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes a first-floor side extension that would have a set down from the ridge of the roof by approximately 150mm, set back from the front of the dwelling by approximately 250mm and would not have a set in from the boundary facing the highway. Officers acknowledge that this would not respect the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD. The two-storey side aspect of the proposals would not be acceptable in conjunction with the first floor side extension. In combination, they would appear disproportionate or and not subordinate and are highly prominent within the street scene due to the corner plot location and position forward of the established building line along Station Road.Â \r\rThe proposed ground floor rear extension would have a depth of approximately 3.5 and a total flat roof height of approximately 2.7m. Whilst officers acknowledge that the flat roof would not respect the pitched roof form of the host dwelling, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host building.\r\rIn regards to the proposed front porch, officers consider it would not significantly affect the character and appearance of the original dwelling or the street generally. Although it would not respect the features of the adjoining property No.22 Station Road, the proposal would respect the pitched roof form of the existing roof and would appear subordinate. Given that this aspect of the development could be constructed under permitted development, this fallback position is given substantial weight in this matter.\r\rOverall, the proposed first floor side and two storey rear extensions would not appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, would appear excessive in scale, and would sit uncomfortably with the host property and surrounding properties and within the street scene.\r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
