    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the visibility splays shall be provided as shown on the approved plans. They shall be permanently retained free from any obstruction to visibility higher than 1.0m above ground level.\r\rReason: In the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the vehicular crossover as shown on the approved plans shall be provided and shall be permanently retained for the purpose of vehicular access and kept free from obstruction thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure proper vehicular access to the site in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "All plans and documents are now accepted, but please make a final amendment to the Application Form Proposal Description as this form will be in the public domain and conflicts with the plans. We have added reference to the demolition of the conservatory in this letter for clarification - if you agree, please amend the description in the Form to: \"Demolition of rear conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension measuring 4.5 metres in depth\"",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character and Food risk Zones 2 and 3.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of garage and erection of two storey side and single storey rear extensions with internal alterations\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Highways\r- Flood Risk\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the existing street scene and the characteristic gaps between these types of properties on the east side of Elmbridge Avenue. The proposed two storey side extension due to its size, siting (no set back from the front elevation, contrary to Policy Guidance 36) and insufficient separation distance would appear dominant and it would reduce the relative openness which is characteristic of the area and the contribution that the Hogsmill Open Space to the rear makes towards the relatively verdant character of Elmbridge Avenue. As such, the proposed side extension would result in an unacceptable impact on the existing street and the host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be approximately 4.5m deep and 3.7m high (when measured from the rear elevation), Officers note difference in ground levels. \r\rWhile the proposed depth of the single storey rear extension would be in-keeping with the surrounding area, the proposed height of 3.7m is contrary to Policy Guidance 33. \r\rWith regards to the proposed roof terrace, it is considered not to be a characteristic feature to the area and therefore not in keeping with the host dwelling and the adjoining properties. \r\rAs such, the proposed two storey side extension by virtue of its size, siting and insufficient set-back from the site boundary with No. 162 Elmbridge Avenue would appear as an overbearing and it would unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rWith regards to the proposed roof terrace, due to its scale and siting it would create a prominent and incongruous feature within the Elmbridge Avenue street scene and it would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character. The proposal would not accord with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an adverse impact to the host property and have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would result in harm to the significance of the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has indicated on the drawing that the proposed single storey rear extension would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the adjoining property No 158 and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. However, considering the difference in ground levels and due to the excessive height of the proposed single storey rear extension, it is considered that it would appear as an overbearing when viewed from the neighbouring property No 158.\r\rWith regards to No 162, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the habitable openings at No 162.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed top roof terrace area, due to its siting and scale, would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or an undue overlooking in relation to the neighbouring properties.\r\rOverall, the excessive height and mass of the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as an overbearing and it would be unneighbourly when viewed from to the adjoining property, No 158 Elmbridge Avenue. Furthermore, the proposed top roof terrace would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or an undue overlooking in relation to the neighbouring properties. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 and 3. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling. A relevant condition would be attached to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development. \r\rHighways\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Elmbridge Avenue.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
