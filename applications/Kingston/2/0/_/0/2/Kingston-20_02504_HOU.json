    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, and proximity to the shared boundary, would result in an undue sense of enclosure in relation to neighbouring property, No. 198 Canbury Park Road, causing an unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight and limiting the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "There is an installation of new front gate in the proposed ground floor plan\rPlease provide all Proposed Elevations to show position of proposed gate at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
