    "It has not been demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that the proposed erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with the installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion complies with B.2(a) (materials) of Class B and C.1(b) (rooflights) of Class C, Part 1, Schedule 2, of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises  part (approximately  half) of an early- mid nineteenth century coach house that is located in the car park that serves flats on the north eastern side of Kingswood Cose.  The building is vacant. \rThe building is not listed, but the boundary with the Oakhill Conservation Area runs to the rear of the application site.. \rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 4\rThe site falls within Flood Risk Zone 1 (low risk).\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for works associated with the conversion of  part of a former coach house into a  one bedroom 2 person dwelling over ground and first floor, incorporating gable end roof extension with side dormer and five roof lights.\r\rRelevant History \rIn 1982 the Council refused the application (26294) to convert the coach house into a one bedroom dwelling. Reasons:\r(a) The development of this small building in the manner proposed would result in a cramped development, having unsatisfactory environmental conditions for the occupiers thereof and little amenity space;\r(b) The distance between the proposed dwelling and the flats in Kingswood Close would be only about 11.6 metres and consequently it is likely that there would be overlooking problems which could be detrimental to the amenities of the occupiers of\rthe flats in the buildings opposite.\r\rThis decision was upheld by the Planning Inspectorate who suggested that the most appropriate use would be the adaption of the building as three garages.\r\rIn 2002 the Council refused an application (02/07054/FUL) for the conversion of the Coach House into a two bedroom dwelling. The reason being that 'the proposed dwellinghouse would provide sub-standard and cramped residential accommodation with unsatisfactory environmental conditions for the occupiers, by virtue of its location surrounded by garages and a garage forecourt, its poor outlook from proposed windows, and lack of outdoor amenity space. The proposal would therefore be contrary to UDP policies H5, BE12 & STR2.\r\rIn 2009 the council refused an application for the  conversion of the coach house into a one bedroom house (09/16242/FUL). The reasons for refusal were:\r1) The proposed conversion of the Coach House to a dwellinghouse, by reason\rof the position of the windows, would result in an overbearing and material loss of privacy for residents of the flats on the northern side of Kingswood Close and of the development itself. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies H1 & BE12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Unitary Development Plan First Alteration.\r2) The proposed dwellinghouse, by reason of its location surrounded by garages\rand access road, its restricted outlook and lack of outdoor amenity space, would provide an unsatisfactory residential environment detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy H 1, BE 12 & RES3 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Unitary Development Plan First Alteration and policy 4B.1 of the London Plan.\r3) The proposal is located adjacent to existing garages and the access road providing access to them. The scheme includes a semi-private frontage of approximately 900mm. Given the relationship of the building to its surroundings, and the nature of the area, which is effectively a car par, the attendant environmental conditions, with levels of noise from vehicular movement, engines, car doors slamming and garage doors opening, would result in a harsh environment detrimental to the living conditions of future occupiers. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy H 1, BE 12 & RES3 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Unitary Development Plan First Alteration and policy 4B.1 of the London Plan.\r\rThis decision was upheld at appeal\r\rConsultation\r9 Neighbouring occupiers were notified and two objections received (from same postal address). The proposal has also been advertised by site and press notice.\rSummarised grounds of objection:\rloss of privacy, \radditional noise and disturbance, \rparking congestion\rStructural considerations\rAccess to garages and communal space\r\rEnvironmental Health Officer: no objection subject to conditions.\rMetropolitan Police Secure by Design Office: Due to crime in the local area, crime and personal safety of its residents and property therein must be key in the design and long term management of this development. Several concerns identified with this proposal:\r-There are no windows or 'active rooms' overlooking all sides of the property. This is required in order to maximise natural surveillance and deter crime. I also advise against using obscured glass in this development as those outside the property need to be aware they can been seen. \r- The rear half of the building appears to be used as vehicle garages accessed off Oak Hill Road. I am concerned as it is unknown what is stored in these garages, how they are maintained, and how the dividing wall is constructed. If there is a fire or a vehicle inside 'fails' how would the structure protect any residents inside. \r- The access to the rear of this building via Oak Hill road shows signs of graffiti and fly tipping. This shows a lack of maintenance, care and ASB. While recorded crime is shown as being low it is well known that most 'low level' crime is significantly under reported and this area shows sign of ASB. \r- Excessive permeability. There is the access road to the rear, hidden away from the road and the alley way at the end of Kingwood Close makes this area vulnerable as there are multiple place to evade capture or observation and conceal.\r - There is no discernible defensive space around the property. \r- There is no designated footpath to the property. This may cause conflict between vehicles that use the garage space and cause danger to the occupier. \r- I recommend a luxe lighting plan throughout the development. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Housing delivery\r- Quality and standard  of accommodation\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r- The design of the proposed development, including heritage; and,\r- Highways and Parking\r\rHousing Delivery\rPolicy CS10 of the Core Strategy (2012) sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan.  Policy H1 of the London Plan 2021 sets a target for the Borough of 9,640 net housing completions within the next ten years, equating to 964 net completions per annum. \r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the principle of the development is considered to be acceptable subject to the further considerations set out below.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \rPolicy D10 requires that Development proposals should:\rh. ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space \rj. incorporate the principles of safe design to reduce the risk and fear of crime, e.g. natural surveillance, appropriate levels of lighting \rk. have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\r\rFor flats, Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD requires 10sqm of amenity space per dwelling + 1sqm per additional occupant, and 50sqm of amenity space per new house (including conversions).  \rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) is clear in relation to private amenity space that private amenity space should be in accordance with local standards, even if they are higher than the minimum requirements of the London Plan (2021).\rPolicy D12 of the London Plan requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal is to provide one x one bedroom 2 person dwelling across two floors. The London Plan  Policy D6 requires a unit of this nature across 2 floors to have a minimum floor area of  58 sqm. The proposal has a floor area of 59sqm across two floors, and satisfies this requirement, with an appropriately sized bedroom. \rCeiling Height: Policy D6  requires all dwellings to have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London. The submitted sections indicate that all  floors would not satisfy this standard, with floor to ceiling heights of 2.1m at ground level and 2.3 metre at first floor. Also elements at first floor level would have restricted heights due to the angled roof form. The section indicates a minimum ceiling height of 1.2m within parts of the ensuite bathroom. The proposal fails to provide an appropriate floor to ceiling height.\r\rLight and outlook: No daylight assessment has been submitted. Notwithstanding, the plans indicate that all habitable rooms would be served by windows and or roof lights, providing reasonable access to light. However,  the main living space at ground level  would have poor outlook, with windows and doors opening onto a narrow strip of amenity space, shown as approximately 900mm in width, which is enclosed by a high obscure glazed privacy screen (approximately 1.5 in height).  The ground floor is single aspect and there is no other source of outlook. \r\rAmenity Space: The dwelling would be served by a small private external area of 3.4 sqm , which as noted above is 900mm wide.  As the dwelling house provides only one bedroom, it is considered that the appropriate amenity space standard would be 10sqm. In accordance with London Plan standards, this should have a minimum width of 1.5m. The proposal fails to provide appropriately sized amenity space, it is heavily enclosed by the obscure glazed screen. The proposal fails to comply with policy requirements in this respect. \r\rNoise: This dwelling fronts the existing access road and car park that serves garages associated with the flats of Kingswood Close to the south of the Coach House. This car park is comprised of 20 garages. Even though the proposed front elevation would be set back 900mm from the access road, it remains the case  as concluded by the Planning Inspector in the most recent appeal decision (09/16242/FUL)  that unacceptable noise levels would arrive from, for example, vehicle movements, engines, car doors slamming, garage doors opening close to the proposed dwelling. Whilst ambient noise levels in this area are quiet and vehicle movements infrequent, this would only serve to emphasis such sudden noises\r\rAccess to the proposed dwelling  would be from the rear car park.  Residents would  be required to walk through the car park to reach their front  door, there would be no  pavement  or dedicated access route to the front door. This location in the rear car park  is away from main traffic and footfall and is poorly lit at night and residents may feel vulnerable returning to their home.  It is noted that there is little to no natural surveillance at this site.  \rAs noted by the Secure by Design Officer, there is concern that this proposed development due to this backland location, as it lacks natural surveillance, it lacks defensible space and the  area shows signs of ASB. \r\rThe access arrangements, including the route through the car park is poor, and this carries significant weight against the proposal.\r\r\rFire Safety: The applicant has not considered Fire Safety. Had the development otherwise been acceptable, further details could have been secured through conditions.\r\rDesign and Heritage\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal  includes a gable end roof extension and would result in the loss of the  pyramidal roof form on one part of this former coach house building.  The proposed roof extension including dormer are of sympathetic form and design, and it is considered that the extensions would  not significantly detract from the appearance of the host building in this backland location. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r                                                                                           \rThe boundary of the Oak Hill Conservation Area runs through the centre of the former coach house. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: \"A Regency and early Victorian linear housing development made up of two separate areas Oakhill Conservation Area (A) which runs along the old turnpike road of Ewell Road and Oakhill Conservation Area (B) which is made up of five large properties in Langley Road. The area around Ewell Road was later converted to a commercial centre, together with an area of substantial Victorian houses and The Wood open space to the west\".\r\r\r\rAssessment of Significance and Impact:\rIt is noted that no heritage assessment has been provided. The rear elevation has not been provided, nor full  flank elevations or 3D visuals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that the proposed extension would have very limited visibility from within the Oakhill Conservation Area, and there would be no harmful impact to the setting of the conservation area.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As noted above, similar previous proposals have been refused on grounds of loss of privacy to 13,15 and 17 Kingswood Close   due to the short separation distance (approximately 11.5m)  between the building and neighbouring  existing flats.  The current proposal provides for a 1.5 m high obscure glazed privacy screen in front of the windows and doors, which officers consider would provide an acceptable mitigation to prevent any undue loss of privacy. \r\rThe increase in bulk  proposed is modest, with no overall increase in height. As such it would not significantly impact on light or outlook to these neighbouring properties.\r\rOverall, it is concluded that with the mitigation measures  proposed,  the development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParking and Highways\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. The maximum parking standard for the new dwelling proposed is 1 space.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\rThis development is car-free and there is no on-site car parking. No objection is raised to the principle of car free development as the site is within the Controlled Parking Zone. Based on the scale and type of development, and as a result of the car-free nature of the proposals, it is not anticipated that the proposals will result in a material impact on the operation of the local highway network.\r\rIf the proposal were found to be acceptable it would be appropriate to ensure  that the development were car capped to prevent eligibility to a residents car parking permit scheme, no such undertaking has been submitted with this proposal. \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2, ensuring that a minimum of one long-stay cycle parking spaces is provided for the proposed one bedroom house. The proposal provides an appropriate cycle store \r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house. The proposal provides an adequate refuse/recycling storage area. \r\r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 requires that applications for planning permission must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. As set out above, because the Council is unable to demonstrate a 5 year supply of deliverable housing sites at present, the policies which are most important for determining the application are out of date and therefore paragraph 11(d) of the Framework applies in this case. This means granting permission for the proposal unless:\ri. the application of policies in the Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provide a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or\rii. any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies of the Framework taken as a whole.\r\rThe proposal will provide 1 no. additional residential dwelling which is accepted as making a modest  but positive contribution to the Council's housing target which carries weight in favour of the proposal. However, the weight to be afforded is significantly tempered by the poor quality of the proposed  residential accommodation. The proposed development would have poor access arrangements via a car park; limited ceiling height; poor outlook; and  insufficient and poor quality private amenity space. For these reasons, the proposal is considered to represent a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policies DM10 and DM13  of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013). \r\rThe proposed development  is car free and provides no off site parking, which is appropriate in this accessible location, subject to a legal agreement to preclude future occupiers of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits. However, no mechanism is in place to ensure that residents of the development would not be entitled to  a resident parking permit.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the net provision of one additional dwelling, when assessed against the policies of the development plan  and the NPPF as a whole. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.\r",
