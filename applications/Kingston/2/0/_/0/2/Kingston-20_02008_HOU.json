    "The proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and design of the proposed dormer and roof light, would create an incongruous feature within the roofscape and the Bellevue Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. It would also result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area which not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located to west of Malden Road, New Malden. \rThe site is not subject to any land use designations. \r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections were received from the same property.\ro\tLoss of privacy \ro\tLoss of light\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Design and character \r- Neighbour amenity  \r- Trees\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign and Character\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rA single storey rear extension is proposed that extends approximately 3m beyond the existing rear extension to the property and 3.1m in height. It is set in from the neighbour boundary by approximately 1m. The proposed extension is modest in scale and designed appropriately in relation to the existing building.\r\rA full width first storey extension is proposed that extends approximately 2.9m beyond the rear elevation of the building and no further than the existing first floor dormer extension which extends only part of the width of the property.  This extension has an overall height of approximately 6.2m and has a part-flat, part-hipped roof. The eaves match that of the existing building and its general design complements the existing building. Overall, the proposed extensions is also considered proportionate in scale and appropriate in design to the main dwelling. \r\rA modest porch extension is proposed which is modest in scale and of an appropriate design that complements the existing building. \r\rFor these reasons, the proposal is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed single storey extension extends approx. 3m beyond the existing ground floor extension but is set in from the neighbour boundary with 267 Malden Road by 1m and is not considered unreasonable in height. It will therefore not be overbearing for this neighbour or result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight.\r\rWith regard to the first floor extension, this extends no further than the existing first floor extension and is set well in from the neighbour boundary. It will therefore not result in a significant difference or appearance in relation to the existing first floor extension. The plans indicate that the proposal will not interrupt the 45 degree line in relation to the nearest habitable window (noting that a bathroom window does not serve a habitable room).  It will therefore not be overbearing for this neighbour or result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight.\r\rWith regard to 263 Malden Road, the ground floor extension extends only marginally beyond the existing ground floor extension to this neighbour. The first floor extension extends further towards 263 Malden Road and will enclose a first floor rear window to this neighbour. However, this is a non-habitable room and, on this basis, the proposal is not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight. \r\rThe proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for either neighbour given the existing site context. \r\rIn summary, the proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).\r\rTrees\r\rThere is a tree protected by a TPO at the back of the garden to the property. This is a significant distance from the proposed extension and so would not be affected.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rThe representation that has been received has been taken into account, however, for the reasons highlighted above, overall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
