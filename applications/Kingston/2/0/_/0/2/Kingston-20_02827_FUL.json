The new shopfront is considered not out of character and to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed erection of a piggyback roof extension and rear roof extension would follow the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 40 by being set back from the front elevation of the house by at least 4m; having materials and detailing that would complement the original house; not increasing the height of the eaves and ridge by more than 1.3m and respecting the roof design of the main dwelling. Additionally, officers note that similar piggyback extensions can be seen in the immediate vicinity, therefore, they are not incongruous near Arlington Road. \r\rThe applicant proposes to demolish the existing conservatory and erect a single-storey rear/side extension that would have a depth of approximately 3.2m and a parapet roof height of approximately 3.1m. The extension would maintain approximately 700mm from the boundary shared with neighbouring property No.48 Arlington Road. The proposed single-storey extension would fall in line with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe proposed first-floor extension to the rear would extend a further 1m, and the applicant intends to retain a pitched roof that would better suit the host dwelling roof. The extension would not be highly visible or incongruous when viewed from Arlington Road and would appear modest in scale and subordinate to the host dwelling. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would not be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The applicant has submitted drawings demonstrating the BRE 45-degree rule, and officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension using the BRE 45-degree rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The proposed rear extension would not breach the 45-degree rule on both plan and elevation, as both neighbouring properties benefit from wide floor-to-ceiling glass doors/windows.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge that the first floor extension would further surpass the neighbours' rear walls, it would not significantly affect the amenities of No.44 and No.48. \r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
