    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting, design and external finishes would create an incongruous addition to the host properties that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from neighbouring gardens.  The proposed development would also detract from the character and appearance of the host properties and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
