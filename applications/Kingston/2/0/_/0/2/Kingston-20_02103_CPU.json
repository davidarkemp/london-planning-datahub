    "The proposed erection of a rear dormer roof extension and the installation of 3 no. rooflights to the front roofslope and alterations to the soil and vent pipe falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, a Strategic Area of Special Character and the dwelling is identified as a Locally Listed Building (both non-designated heritage assets).\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals; 1 objection has been received by neighbouring properties relating to privacy. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- Trees and Landscape\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rTwo Storey Side Extension/Floor Extension -\rOfficers note that the proposed development would be visible within the streetscene, however, the proposal would not significantly detract from the host dwelling or surrounding area, as the houses on Traps Lane vary in design and size, therefore would not be an odd addition to the wider area. Additionally, the proposed side extension includes a pitched roof which would be consistent with the existing pitched roof element of the host dwelling and it would be set back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm, in respect of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD.\r\rSingle Storey Side/Rear Extension -\rThe proposed side/rear extension would have a total height of 4.9m falling outside the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33, however, the dwelling sits on a spacious plot, with a reasonable distance to the shared boundaries and would have a depth of 4.5m from the existing rear wall which follows the Residential Design guidance for detached dwellings. The extension would not be highly visible within the street scene.\r\rOverall, the proposed extensions are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officer acknowledge the objection raised in relation to a loss of privacy to properties on the west side of Traps Lane, however, the proposed development would still maintain the 21m distance between the facing windows of habitable rooms, in accordance with the Residential Desing SPD, Policy Guidance 16. Furthermore, the additional windows would be situated on the front elevation of the dwelling facing towards the road which is a common relationship for properties along Traps Lane. Within the context of existing development in the area and the position of the public highway and footpaths it is not considered that the additional fenestration on the front elevation would give rise to any significant loss of privacy to neighbours when compared to the existing situation.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, although the proposed development would not accord with the Residential Design SPD guidance, the development is considered to be of an acceptable character and design, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character or the Locally Listed Building.\r \rTrees and Landscape\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer Comment: The neighbouring property to the north/north-east, The Conifers is subject to an area Tree Preservation Order (TPO). The proposed development is in close proximity to the boundary that the Root Protection Areas (RPAs) of protected trees and could be impactful. The applicant has submitted an Arboricultural Impact Assessment in relation to this TPO and no objection was raised by RBK Tree and Landscape officer.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
