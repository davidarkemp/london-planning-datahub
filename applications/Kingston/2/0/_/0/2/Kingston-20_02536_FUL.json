    "The proposed development, by reason of the size of bedroom 3 within the four bedroom unit, as well as the unit's gross internal area, would offer substandard and cramped accommodation, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for future occupants of the development. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed parking spaces could be accessed independently, whilst allowing vehicles to park perpendicular to the road and enter and exit the spaces in a forward gear. It follows that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019, Policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS7 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r6 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received in support or in objection. \r\rPlanning History\r\r23/02916/CPU Erection of a hip to gable roof extension. Granted 15.11.23 \r23/02347/CPU Erection of hip to gable roof extension. Refused 28.08.23\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission  for the demolition of single storey rear extension, erection of single storey rear and first floor side extension and rear dormer roof extension with Juliet balcony,  installation of 3nos front rooflights and 2nos side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Changes to fenestrations.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises a two storey, semi detached dwellinghouse. \r\rThe surrounding properties consist of predominantly semi detached dwellinghouses. \r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment :   The application seeks the for the demolition of an existing single storey rear extension measuring a depth of 3.71m and 2.89m wide to be replaced by a single storey rear extension measuring a depth of approximately 4m and a width  of approximately  8.5m. The proposed roof of single storey extension would present 2 roof forms - a single aspect pitch roof slope with an eaves roof height  2.89m  and to the pitch  3.87m  and a lower gradient  single aspect  pitch roof  grading down towards neighbouring property. The proposed extension would accommodate 2 rooflights and the rear elevation would present large windows.  No windows are proposed on the side elevation of the proposed single storey rear extension. \r\rWhile the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD,  Officers consider that it would not appear a disproportionate addition to the host dwellinghouse, and given that similar extensions  are in the immediate vicinity, it is considered that it would not appear to be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area. \r\rAt ground floor, the conversion of the garage into a habitable room is proposed and subsequently alterations would be proposed to the frontage of the dwellinghouse with the introduction of an additional  bay window.  Officers note the position of the proposed bay window follows the existing building line and is aligned with the existing bay window. The proposed tile roof form above the bay window is considered acceptable. Officers consider this proposed alteration  would be proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwellinghouse  would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.  In addition proposed changes to door and fenestrations are noted for the ground floor side elevation which are deemed acceptable. \r\rOfficers note that the removal of the existing side extension towards the rear of the property would restore the side access would be regained from the street into the garden. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed first floor side extension  would be retained within the proposed footprint of the ground floor and would result in the loss of an existing side dormer which serves an existing bedroom  and existing roofslope. The proposed extension would enlarge an existing bedroom at the front of the dwelling and introduce a bathroom and en suite towards the rear.  A single window is proposed on this side elevation to serve the bathroom and a single window would be introduced on the rear elevation to serve the en suite.  Officers consider that the proposed roof for the first floor side extension reflects and relates well to the main house and its  existing and proposed roof form.\r\rWhilst not strictly complying  with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD , in terms of set back,  it would be appropriately set in from the boundary and would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling. Given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity, Officers consider that the proposed development would appear an appropriate addition to the host dwelling and in keeping with the surrounding area. Officers are also cognizant of the the fallback position afforded by application 23/02916/CP \r\rGiven that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would comply with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, officers consider that it would appear an appropriate and proportionate addition to the host property and would appear in keeping with the surrounding area.  \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, height, massing and design, It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rOfficers note that the proposed single storey rear extension would not extend beyond  the  rear building line of  nos 77 and 73 Arundel Road.  The same can be said with regard to the front building line.  It is noted an adequate  separate distance  would be maintained between No73 and No 75.  \r\rFenestration alterations  are proposed on the side elevation at ground, first floor and roof. These changes would not be considered  to have an adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties.  \r\rOverall, given the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves the conversion of the  existing garage space. Based on the existing floor plans, it does not appear to be of a size capable of fitting a modern car. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
