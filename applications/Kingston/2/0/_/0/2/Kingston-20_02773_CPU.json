    "The application site relates to a semi-detached property to the west of Robin Hood Way, Kingston Vale.\r\rThe site lies within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability).\r\r22 neighbouring properties have been notified. 2 objections were received making the following comments.\r-\tDrawings are inaccurate\r-\tSignificant additional height\r-\tOverbearing\r-\tLoss of daylight \r-\tNot permitted development\r-\tBoundary encroachment \rOfficer note: The submitted plans for the previously approved applications show the extension extending to the neighbour boundary and the building, as built, does not appear in any way different.\r\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r21/00919/HOU - Vehicle crossover and new front gate. Granted 02 Aug 2021\r\r20/01293/FUL - Variation of Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission ref: 18/14880/FUL (Erection of single storey rear extension. Erection of first floor side extension to provide self contained two storey dwelling) dated 08/11/2018 consisting of the erection of an enclosed single storey front porch. Granted 03 Aug 2020\r\r18/14880/FUL - Erection of single storey rear extension. Erection of first floor side extension to provide self contained two storey dwelling. Granted 31 Oct 2019\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign and Heritage \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rFire Strategy\r\rDesign and Heritage\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rLocal policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) require that proposals relate well to their surroundings, recognise distinctive local features, have regard to the historic environment and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.  \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rThis is a retrospective application for a single storey rear extension initially approved through 18/14880/FUL and subsequently varied through 20/01293/FUL. The rear extension has not been built in accordance with the approved plans.\r\rThe overall height of the extension appears to be the same with the main changes being an increase to the eaves height and the inclusion of an upstand. \r\rThere appear to be some inaccuracies on the drawings with the height of the extension differing on the rear and side elevations. It is therefore not possible to make a definitive assessment or to accept these drawings for the purposes of this retrospective application.\r\rNotwithstanding, photos have been submitted and drawings of the extension have also been submitted by an architect (by a third party) which show the plans submitted are broadly accurate. Based on these drawings and information, it can be estimated that the extension is now approximately 3.1m to the eaves (increased from approximately 2.7m) and that the height at the shared  boundary with 123 Robin Hood Way will be higher due to the upstand (approximately 3.3m). The building has a shallower pitched roof, and varies modestly in height, but is otherwise the same as previously approved. Notwithstanding the inaccuracy with the plans, which prevents a full and definitive assessment, it can reasonably be concluded that these modest changes would not change the overall assessment of the design and impact on the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNotwithstanding, in the absence of accurate drawings, a full assessment cannot be made and the application shall be refused on this basis. \r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: \rThe site is adjoined by No. 123 Robin Hood Way to the south and 119 Robin Hood Way to the north.  \r\rAs referred to above, the drawings submitted are not wholly accurate and so a full and definitive assessment on the impact on neighbour amenity cannot be made. \r\rNotwithstanding, photos have been submitted which show the extension in situ against the boundary with 123 Robin Hood Way and drawings of the extension have also been submitted by an architect (on behalf of a third party). Based on these drawings and information, the height on the boundary with 123 Robin Hood Way will be approximately 3.3m (increased from approximately 2.7m). Whilst a full assessment cannot be made, based on the submitted plans and photos submitted by the third party, which show that the extension extends only approximately 2.6m in depth beyond the existing extension to this neighbour, this modest increase in height is not considered overbearing for this neighbour. \r\rWith regard to daylight and sunlight, the neighbouring No. 123 Robin Hood Way has a ground floor extension with large patio doors. In such cases, in line with the Council's Residential Design SPD guidance, the midpoint of the pitched roof would be used for the purposes of the 45 degree assessment with the measurement taken at 1.6m above ground level. Whilst a definitive assessment cannot be made, it can reasonably be concluded that the drawings submitted by the third party are reasonably accurate (as they use the drawings to undertake their own assessment) and, based on these calculations, the 45 degree line would not be interrupted and so the proposal would not result in an undue loss of daylight to this neighbour. Given the siting and relative height of the proposed extension above this rooflight, officers consider the modest additional height will have a negligible impact on the neighbours rooflights (in terms of daylight and sunlight and visual impact).\r\rWith regard to 119 Robin Hood Way, the extension is set away from the boundary with this neighbour and the modest increase in height is unlikely to be considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight to this neighbour.\r\rNotwithstanding, in the absence of accurate drawings, a full assessment cannot be made and the application shall be refused on this basis. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy in line with the requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan. Had this development been otherwise acceptable, a condition could have been applied for further details, to align with the above policy. \r\rOverall, in the absence of accurate drawings, it cannot be concluded that the development is in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for refusal.",
