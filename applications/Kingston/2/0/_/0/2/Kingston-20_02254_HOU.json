    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order (2015) (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) within the north-west (side) elevation unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level in the south-east (side) elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Please provide Existing Roof Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions. The plans must show the direction of North. A scale bar is encouraged.",
