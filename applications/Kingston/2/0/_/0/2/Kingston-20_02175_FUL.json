    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing rear extension and erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would project approximately 2m beyond the rear line of the host dwelling that shows staggered rear elevation. The proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.5m and the total height would be similar to the existing one - approximately 4m. \r\rGiven the proposed scale, mass and bulk and the size of the plot, it is considered that the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would not be visible within Beech Grove, as such there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is noted that No 17 Beech Grove benefits from a rear extension, while No 13 shows the original house layout. \r\rGiven the modest eaves height of the proposal and its depth, it is considered that it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to both adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight. While the maximum height of 4m could cause some overshadowing to and overbearing to the rear garden of No. 13, it would be for a depth of 2m which is, on balance, considered to be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of part two storey/part single storey side and rear wrap around extension. Internal alteration.\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the refused scheme ref no 23/00511/HOU for erection of part two storey/part single storey side and rear extension, roof extension with rear dormer and Juliet balcony and installation of 3nos front and 1no rear roof lights to facilitate loft conversion due to the following reason:\r\rGiven the prominent position of the host dwelling, it is considered that the proposed flat roof form over the two storey side and rear extension would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the proposed extensions would result in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the application property and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe proposed pitched roof form over the two storey side and rear extension is considered to relate well to the host dwelling and the surrounding area, as such the applicant has successfully addressed the previous reason for refusal. \r\rThe scale, mass and bulk of the proposed extensions is similar to the previous scheme.\r\rThe proposed part single part two storey side extension would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 5.5m. It would abut the common boundary and it would be approximately 1m wide.  Given its modest scale and the proposed design, this element of the proposal is considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe proposed part single part two storey rear extension would be approximately 4m deep. The two storey element would be set along the common boundary, it is noted that it would be adjacent to the vehicular access road that serves the adjoining maisonettes. Due to the proposed scale, design and the separation distances, this element of the proposal is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension element of the proposal would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth (which is up to 3.5m). However, considering its modest height (approximately 2.9m)  the proposed design and its siting, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposal would fail the 45 degree test in relation to the ground floor patio door at No 65 Tolworth Road, however considering that it is not the only habitable opening to the kitchen/dining area to this property, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. It has been demonstrated that the proposed second floor rear extension would pass the 45 degree test in relation to the habitable openings on the first floor at No 65.  \r\rWith regards to the adjoining maisonettes Nos 59 and 61 Tolworth Road, the proposal would not significantly change the existing situation due to sufficient separation distance. It is noted that the existing openings on the side elevation at the adjoining maisonettes are not classified as 'habitable' openings. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting, design and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The application seeks to obtain a Certificate of Lawfulness for an existing residential C3 use (self contained unit and amenity space). The application is made under section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and is relying on the use being in existence for 4 or more years in line with the time limits set for lawful development/uses under section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) \r\rAssessment \r\rThe onus of proof in a LDC application is firmly on the applicant. While the LPA should always co-operate with an applicant seeking information they may hold about the planning status of land, by making records readily available, they need not go to great lengths to show that the use, operations, or failure to comply with a condition, specified in the application, is, or is not, lawful. While LPAs are statutorily required to maintain the planning register, this is not a complete record of the planning status of all land in their area. In many cases, the applicant for a certificate will be best placed to produce information about the present, and any previous, activities taking place on the land, including a copy of any planning permission he may hold. Some information, especially about the history of any unauthorised activity on the land, will be particularly within the applicant's knowledge.\r\rThe application is said to relate to 456A Ewell Road and the site location plan shows the site edged in red. The planning statement states this site to be in three parts a light industrial unit marked as unit 1, a self contained residential unit marked as unit 2 and a yard with sheds marked as unit 3 said to be in residential use either separately or ancillary to unit 2. 456 A Ewell Road would appear to be as evidenced in the supporting planning statement a site consisting of a mix of uses (lawful or unlawful) and it is unclear as to whether there is one or more planning unit within the red line. It would appear that the red line of the site includes uses outside of the scope of the certificate notably the part marked unit 1 as shown on the plan within the submitted planning statement. It is considered that there is sufficient ambiguity to question whether the site has been correctly identified and whether the site location plan is correct.\r\rThe application form and the planning statement state that the application relates to the elements of the site marked as unit 2 and unit 3. \r\rIt is acknowledged that their is a body of evidence presented by the applicant that points towards a residential use being in existence at what is stated as being unit 2 in the supporting planning statement. However this is somewhat ad-hoc, varied in time periods and not presented in away that appears there has been a continuous use going back 4 years from the date of which the certificate application has been submitted. \r\rIn regards to the residential use of the part of the site marked out as unit 3 the evidence presented is even less convincing. This amounts to a photograph or two of persons occupying the space with this giving no clear indication as to what their presence on the grounds relates to or how the area relates to unit 2.   \r\r456 A Ewell Road would appear to be as evidenced in the supporting planning statement a site consisting of a mix of uses and it is unclear as to whether these are one or more planning unit. It would appear that the red line of the site includes uses outside of the scope of the certificate notably the part marked unit 1 as shown on the plan within the submitted planning statement. \r\rOfficers are not satisfied that the applicant has clearly demonstrated, on the balance of probability, that the claim is lawful, and that the use sought, residential use C3 (self contained unit and amenity space), is lawful. \r\rAs such the LPA would require a fuller detailed submission to address its concerns. The fact that a LDC may be refused because the onus of proof is not discharged by the applicant does not preclude the submission of a further application if better evidence is subsequently available. A refusal to issue a LDC is therefore not necessarily conclusive that something is not lawful: it may merely mean that, so far, insufficient evidence has been presented to satisfy the LPA that the use, operation or activity is lawful. \r\rIt is concluded at this stage the information submitted to date is insufficient to allow the LPA to issue a certificate.",
    "It is considered that there is sufficient ambiguity to question whether the site has been correctly identified and whether the site location plan is correct. The applicant in any future submission should address this point and demonstrate why they consider the site identified in red to be one planning unit.",
    "The proposed rear extension appears to connect to the existing outbuilding/garage. If the proposed extension is being joined to a previous enlargement, it will not be permitted development if the size of the total enlargement (being the proposed enlargement together with any previous enlargement) exceeds these limitations. Therefore, compliance under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (ja) has not been demonstrated",

    "Officer comment: An enclosed timber refuse store is proposed along the boundary of the site that would house 1no. 1100 ltr. bin, 2no. 360 ltr. bins, 4no. 240 ltr. bins, 1no. 660 ltr. bin. This is sufficient amount of the refuse storage for the number and size of units, as per the Council's Recycling and Waste Technical Planning Guidance.\r\rThe applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed and are hereby approved, subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 9 (Bin and Recycle Facilities) of planning permission 22/00597/FUL, which states:\r\rNo part of the development shall be occupied until details of bin storage and recycling facilities have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.

    "Condition 4 (Waste and Recycle Facilities) of planning permission 23/01157/FUL states: \r\rNotwithstanding the submitted plans, prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer response: It is understood that there are 4 small units within the building. A refuse area is proposed, concealed behind the raised boundary wall. This would have a door that opens into the site. Within the store, 4 small 140l refuse bins are proposed, 2 large recycling bins and space for 6 no. smaller recycling boxes. The overall level of refuse storage exceeds the requirements for communal storage set out in the Council's Recycling and Waste Technical Planning Guidance and is considered acceptable.",
    "The application seeks to obtain a Certificate of Lawfulness for an existing C3 residential unit and ancillary amenity space. The application is made under section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and is relying on the use being in existence for 4 or more years in line with the time limits set for lawful development/uses under section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) \r\rAssessment \r\rThe onus of proof in a LDC application is firmly on the applicant.

Some information, especially about the history of any unauthorised activity on the land, will be particularly within the applicant's knowledge.\r\rThe application is supported by a site location plan which edges the site in red. The site, it is stated within the supporting documentation, is in mixed use. Within the red line there are uses outside the scope of uses the applicant seeks a certificate for. The supporting planning statement states that the site is divided into what the applicant calls three units. Unit 1 a light industrial unit. Unit 2 a self contained residential unit. Unit 3 amenity space with sheds ancillary to unit 2. The submission raises ambiguity as to whether there is one or more planning unit on the site and whether the red line has been correctly drawn. \r\rThe certificate seeks to establish the lawful use of what the applicant calls unit 2 and unit 3 on the plan contained within their planning statement submitted in support of the application. The inference from the application is that both unit 2 and 3 have a lawful use by way of having been in use for a period of 4 or more years. It is acknowledged that there is a body of evidence that has been submitted that would suggest that there has been a residential use at unit 2. However the evidence is ad-hoc with gaps in the time period therefore not specifically demonstrating a continuous residential use for a period of 4 or more years dating back from the day of the submission of the application. \r\rIn regards to unit 3 the evidence is limited essentially to a couple of photographs showing persons occupying the space on one particular day. There is no compelling evidence that allows officers to conclude that the space is linked to unit 2 or in itself has been used for a period of 4 or more years immediately prior to the submission of the certificate for a residential use.  \r\rOfficers are not satisfied that the applicant has clearly demonstrated, on the balance of probability, that the claim is lawful, and that the use sought, a C3 residential unit and ancillary amenity space, is lawful. \r\rAs such the LPA would require a fuller detailed submission to address its concerns. The fact that a LDC may be refused because the onus of proof is not discharged by the applicant does not preclude the submission of a further application if better evidence is subsequently available.
