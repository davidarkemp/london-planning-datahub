    "Any replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased, shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\r\rAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\r\rThe applicant is advised that the following will be a suitable replacement:\r\r(a) [Dawn Redwood (Metasequoia glyptostroboides)]",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side extension would be modest in scale, with a pitched roof that would be appropriately set down from the ridge of the roofslope, and in from the front elevation at first floor levels. While the proposed roof form would not strictly match the gable roof form, given the modest scale, officers consider that the proposed extension would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would meet the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed solar panels would be flush with the rear roof slope and therefore would have limited impact on the appearance of the host property or surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development and siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rWhile the proposed extension would propose openings to the side elevation at first floor level, officers note that the dwelling does not have any immediate neighbours to the north and that the proposal would largely replicate the existing levels of glazing in the existing north elevation, and as such it is considered that the proposed development would not result in loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would demolish the internal garage, however, while the existing garage would be substantial in depth, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would not be wide enough to comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision. Despite the fact that the proposed development would not result in any loss or gain of off-street parking on site, the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling can accommodate on-site car parking.\r\rOfficers note that proposal would retain a smaller garage, and while it would not be appropriate for parking cars, it would be appropriate in accommodating on-site cycle parking in accordance with the standards set out in Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Proposal Description - This has been amended for clarity. Please confirm if you agree, or amend if you disagree with the following description:  \"Demolition of outbuildings and erection of single storey rear extension, part single storey/part two storey side extension, and hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony and installation of 2nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\""
