    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows or rooflights in the side elevations (and situated on the first floor) shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The flat roof(s) of the extensions hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Malvern Road.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/02530/HOU - Erection of single-storey rear and first floor rear extensions, 2no side dormer roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion, associated changes to fenestration - refused on 28.09.2022.\r23/00009/HOU - Loft conversion incorporating increase in ridge height and 4 no. dormers - refused on 09 Mar 2023\r\rProposal \rLoft conversion incorporating increase in ridge height and 4 no. dormers and 2nos. side rooflights \rThe proposal seeks to address the reason for the subsequent second planning refusal of application 23/00009/HOU, namely the failure of the side dormers to conform to the 45 degree rule. The previously proposed rear dormer on the side of No41 has now been reduced in size. All other aspects of the proposal  including street scene, set back distance of dormers, height, remain the same as in the previous application 23/00009/HOU.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no response received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The current scheme is a revised proposal that relates to the refused planning applications 22/02530/HOU and 23/0009/HOU  for  erection of single-storey rear and first floor rear extensions, 2no side dormer roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion and associated changes to fenestration.\r\rThe proposed roof extension would result in increased eaves height and the total height of the building of approximately 8.4m, which would be approximately 0.8m  higher that the existing roof line at the adjoining property No 45 Malvern Road. It is noted that the proposed height of the eaves would be similar to No 41 Malvern Road. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed dormer would be set down 500 from the ridge height and set up from the eaves by 500mm. It would strongly resemble the adjoining semi-detached dormer extensions and therefore is considered acceptable. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  The previous application was refused  on grounds of adverse amenity impact, as the proposed side dormers  failed the 45 test in relation to the closest first floor rear habitable room window at No. 41 Malvern Road. It is advised that the  failure of the front dormer on that side was due to an error in the original survey of No 41. The first floor habitable window was misplaced towards the front of the property by a considerable margin , thereby causing the proposed front dormer of No 43 to have a considerable impact on loss of light to that window in the 45 degree elevation plane. The first floor habitable window of No41 has now been re surveyed and accurately positioned, and the revised drawings indicate that the proposed front dormer no longer has any impact regarding loss of light.\rThe proposed rear dormer has been reduced in size, and officer conclude that the reduced mass of the dormer would not significantly impact on light or outlook to the neighbouring property \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.  Side dormers ae shown fitted with obscure glazing , and a  condition for obscured glazing has been added to prevent substantial loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment:  The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan subject to planning condition.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
