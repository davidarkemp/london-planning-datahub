    "The proposed erection of a rear dormer roof extension with the installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed single storey rear extensions would have a maximum flat roof height of 3m and depths ranging between 2.5m and 1.3m which would comply with the residential design SPD. The extensions would appear subordinate and proportionate to the host building and would not be visible in the streetscene. \r\rThe 2.5m deep single storey extension would also allow the 700mm extension of the existing terrace, as shown on the proposed drawings, however, this would also not be visible in the street scene or be in plain sight to neighbouring properties. Therefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD states that a balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character or other adjacent heritage assests. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
