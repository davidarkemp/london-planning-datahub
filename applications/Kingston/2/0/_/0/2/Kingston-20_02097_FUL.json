    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rConversion of garage into habitable space, erection of part two storey/part single storey rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front rooflights. Fenestration alteration and internal modifications.\r\rConsultations\r13 properties were notified of the proposal.  \r- Three representations have been received from one address objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Right to light\r\rAny matters controlled under non-planning laws such as right to light are not material planning consideration and they cannot be included within the assessment. The other concerns will be addressed with this report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed hip to gable roof extension due to its prominent position and excessive scale would appear dominant and disproportionate in relation to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The resulting roof form would have an awkward appearance. The proposed rear dormers would appear contrived and cramped. It is noted that the proposed dormers would not be set down by a minimum of 500mm as recommended Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe proposed part single part two storey rear extension would be set along the east boundary and approximately 0.98m to the west boundary. Policy guidance 34 states that two storey rear extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling. In this case given the excessive scale of the proposed roof extensions, together with the proposed scale, mass and bulk of the proposed part single part two storey rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed conversion of the garage is acceptable from character and appearance perspective. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised within written representations regarding the adverse impact of the proposal in relation to the adjoining properties. \r\rThe proposal would pass the 25 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at the ground and first floor levels in the rear elevation of the properties Nos 173, 171 and 169 Wolsey Drive and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties.  \r\rWith regards to the adjoining property No 28 Fernhill Gardens, the proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at the ground and first floor levels at this property.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposal in relation to Nos 169-175 Wolsey Gardens and separation distance between 22m- 19.8m, it is considered that the proposal would not appear as overbearing. \r\rThe proposed rear extension would project approximately 2.5m beyond the existing rear building line at No 28, given the separation distance and the proposed design, it is considered that the proposal would not appear as overbearing when viewed from the rear garden of this adjoining property. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\r\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a terrace of maisonettes, at first floor level. \r\r27 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to the Excessive height or bulk of buildings, Loss of light/Sunlight and Privacy. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r23/01524/FUL - Erection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 3nos front rooflights to convert into 2 flats. Installation of solar panels. Refused on 19.10.2023\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The standard of accommodation provided;\r- The impact upon the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact upon the residential amenity of neighbouring residents;\r- Fire Safety Assessment;\r\rAccommodation Provided   \rPolicy DM 14 of the Core Stagey states that the Council will resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types) and, in particular, dwellings which are suitable for family accommodation. To protect existing family units that meet an identified need, the Council will, where necessary, limit the conversion of family units into houses in multiple occupation.\r\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted a planning application ref: 23/01524/FUL, which was refused for the following reasons:\r\r- The proposal would result in the loss of an existing 3 bedroom family dwelling, for which the Borough has a significant need, without adequate replacement, contrary to Policy DM 14 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).  \r\r- Given the inadequate floor to ceiling heights and lack of private amenity space, the overall standard of accommodation is considered to be poor, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy and the Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe proposed development will not include the conversion into 2 separate units but rather remain as a 3 bedroom family dwelling, as the applicant has omitted this aspect of the proposal. As a result, the concern raised previously of the failure to meet the floor-to-ceiling heights of 2.5m over 75% of the GIA has also been erased. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The previously refused application was also refused for the following reason:\r\rThe proposal, by reason of the combined height, width, depth and overall scale of the rear dormer, and lack of set down from the roof ridge, is considered a visually intrusive and incongruous form of development that is incompatible with the surrounding area, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rWhilst the applicant has not amended the width of the proposed dormer (5.1m), the height has been reduced to approximately 2.4m and the depth to 2.4m, reducing its bulky appearance. The extension is set 500mm up from the eaves and in from the sides of the building, in line with the guidance set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD. Officers acknowledge that the dormer still has a set down from the ridge of 250mm and as previously acknowledged, it is accepted that it would not be possible to set any further down whilst achieving satisfactory floor-to-ceiling heights and that there are other dormers nearby with similar set downs, notably on the neighbouring 102 Gilders Road.\r\rAdditionally, it would not be visible from Gilders Road and therefore would not result in any impact on the existing Gilders Road street scene. Alterations to the front roof slope are considered acceptable within the street scene.\r\rGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the siting of the dormer, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an overbearing effect. The proposed dormer would result in a slight increase in overlooking and loss of privacy to a small car parking area. However, this area is already overlooked by the existing maisonettes and any increase in overlooking and loss of privacy, would not be significant.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of an existing garage and the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises  a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to demolish an existing garage and the erection of a single storey  rear extension.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension would project a depth of 3.2m  and extend the full width of the house at 6.3m. Officers note that the proposed extension would extend to be in alignment with the neighbouring single storey extension at no 121 Grand Avenue.\r\rIt would have a single mono pitch roof  with an eaves height 2.56m and full height of 3.3m where the extension adjoins the existing rear extension. Officers note that the  single mono pitch roof of the existing extension would be remodelled to present a flat roof .\r\rThe proposed materials and finishes would be render, tiles and UPVC doors and windows to match existing. No new fenestration would be introduced on the proposed side elevation facing toward neighbouring no 117 Grand Avenue.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rOverall the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the characters or appearance of the areas as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r",

No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey side and first floor side extensions. Internal alterations including the conversion of the garage to a habitable room. ALterations to fenestrations. Alterations to front garden landscaping.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a detached dwelling. \rThe site resides within the Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to construct a ground floor side extension to the east of the existing garage with its purpose to accommodate bins, store and cycle storage. The proposed depth of the  side extension would be 6.45m. The  width of the proposed rear elevation would be 2.08m and the width of the proposed front elevation  would be  2.178m. It would present a flat roof with a proposed eaves height 2.61m. To accommodate the proposal, alterations would be made to the existing landscaping in this vicinity.\r\rBoth of these proposed elevations would have single  painted timber boarded gate or door.  The proposed extension would be constructed in brick work to match existing and finishes in cladding to match existing. No windows are proposed on the eastern elevation. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed first floor extension would be retained within the existing footprint of the existing ground floor garage below. It would have a single pitch sloping roof with a proposed front elevation  eaves height of  4.26m  and a proposed rear elevation eaves height of 3m.  New fenestration would be introduced on both the proposed front and rear elevations. No fenestration is to be introduced on the eastern flank wall.  THe proposed first floor extension would be constructed in brick work to match existing and proposed cladding would match existing.  \r\rThe conversion of the existing integral garage to  a habitable space consisting of an office and guest bedroom would result in the loss of the existing garage door to be replaced by  white powder coated metal framed double glazed sliding doors. Landscaping is to be introduced in front of this elevation.\r\rOfficers note obscured glazing is to be installed on the first floor west elevation of the dwelling house. Other fenestration alterations are proposed throughout the property and are deemed acceptable.\r\rOverall the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the characters or appearance of the areas as a result of the proposals. \r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves  the conversion of the integral garage  into a habitable space. It is noted that the  area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans explicitly show replacement cycle parking to be accommodated in the proposed ground floor side extension. This would be compliant with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.  \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\rNo response received. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would not fully accord with the LPA's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD. However a number of similar extensions have been built on the road and those surrounding. In the context of the site and its surroundings in this instance the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \rSCAAC objection. Object to the use of sash horns. \r\rOfficer comment: The matters raised are addressed in the officers assessment. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 189 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal involves the replacement of the existing windows with timber framed windows. The sash windows would have sash horns. It is noted that the window to the front of the property at upper ground floor level to be replaced has existing sash horns as does the end property in the terrace at the upper ground floor No.65 Maple Road. Whilst the Conservation Area Advisory Committee comments are acknowledged that the lack of sash horns can point to the age of a property it is considered that the precedent for sash horns has already been set and forms part of the current character and appearance of the conservation area. \r\rIn this instance in the context of the site and its surroundings and through the evolution of time the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development or cause harm to the designated heritage asset the St Andrew's Square Conservation Area as the overall character and appearance of the Consrvation Area would be preserved and the proposal would not erode its existing character and appearance.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners.
