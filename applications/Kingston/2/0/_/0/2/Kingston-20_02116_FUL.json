    "The application seeks to replace the light heads of the existing floodlights.

It is considered that the proposal would not consitute development as per the definition of section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located within the Tolworth, Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to:\r- Excessive height or bulks of buildings- Fumes- Loss of light/sunlight- Noise- Privacy\rOfficers acknowledge the objections regarding noise, however, officers would not expect noise levels from a development of this scale to be unacceptable to neighbouring properties. Additionally, concerns raised regarding the fumes are not considered material planning considerations, therefore will not be included in the assessment of this application. All other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst officers acknowledge the proposed roof aims to respect the host dwellinghouse roof form by mimicking the pitched roof and would maintain distance from the roof ridge. The proposed depth (3.8m) and flat/pitched roof height (3.4m) of the ground floor in combination with the proposed first floor extension would appear bulky in the immediate vicinity of Red Lion Road and would not generally respect the guidance of the Residential Design SPD. \rPolicy Guidance 33 (single storey rear extensions) of the Residential Design SPD states:\r\r- Extensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth.- a flat roof should not exceed 3m in height.\r- a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height.\rPolicy Guidance 34 (two-storey rear extensions) of the Residential Design SPD states:\r\r- Two storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling.\r- Extensions proposed on the boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted.\r\rConsidering the above, the proposed development would be incongruous and unacceptable in the vicinity of Red Lion Road. Officers consider that the proposed extension would have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rAlthough officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight or daylight, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property No. 93 Red Lion Road by reason of overbearing appearance.\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would not generally be in keeping with the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would result in any harm to the Tolworth, Area of Archaeological Significance.\rHistoric England (Archaeology) was not consulted on this proposal as the proposal would not fall within the following categories:\r\r- Major planning applications over 0.5 hectares whether in an APA or not\r- Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping requests and Environmental Statements\r- Applications supported by an archaeological desk-based assessment\r- Minor planning applications in any APA (tiers 1 to 3)\r- Domestic basement applications in APA tiers 1 and 2 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers consult GLAAS on any domestic basement in an APA.\r- Householder and equivalent-scale very minor applications in APA tier 1 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers do not consult GLAAS on householder or equivalent applications unless within 50m of a scheduled monument.\r- Proposed substantial demolition or major alterations to historic buildings\r- Submission of details in relation to archaeological conditions\r- Appeals on applications for which an archaeological issue has previously been identified\r\rAs such, no comment would be required from Historic England (Archaeology).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of neighbouring property No. 55 & 59 Kingshill Avenue, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located on the east side of Minerva Road. \rThe site falls within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area and Flood Zone 2. \r\rProposal \rRaising roof height, erection of 'piggyback' roof extension with rear Juliet balcony and installation of 8no. side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rRepresentations\r9 properties were notified of the proposal. \rThree representations have been received with comments summarised as follows:\r\rInappropriate design/layout\rLoss of privacy as a result of the proposed door and Juliet balcony \r\rOfficer response: Officers note objections in relation to the proposed rear extension which is subject to a separate application (23/00303/CPU) and therefore cannot be included within this assessment. \rThe listed above concerns will be addressed with  the report. \r\rConsultations\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objections to the proposal subject to a brick finish and materials for fenestration to be in keeping with the Victorian architecture of the building. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area; and,\r- Fire Safety; and,\r- Flood Risk.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed 'piggyback' extension would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 4m and the proposed increase in eaves height would be approximately 1.3m, in accordance with Policy Guidance 40 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe application site is located on the narrow plot, therefore the proposed roof extension would not be highly visible within the street view. It is noted that the adjoining properties Nos 24 and 26 Minerva Road benefit from similar roof extensions. As such it is considered that there would be no significant impact to the existing street scene. \r\rThe submitted drawings suggest that the proposed wall would be made of brick that would be similar to the existing one and the proposed roof tiles would match the existing ones.\r\rIt is noted that the Kingston Town CAAC raised no objections to the proposal subject to a brick finish and materials for fenestration to be in keeping with the Victorian architecture of the building. \r\rAs no detailed information was submitted in terms of the proposed fenestration materials, this issue could be resolved via condition.\r\rThe proposed sliding doors and Juliet balcony is considered acceptable from the design point of view and in-keeping with the host dwelling.\r\rIt is noted that the submitted Design and Access Statement incorrectly states 'The walls will be rendered to match the existing'. Officers assessment is based on the submitted plans and photographs of the application site. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The main dwellings to consider when assessing the impacts on neighbouring amenity are the adjoining properties to the side: Nos 20 and 24 Minerva Road and properties to the rear of the application site Nos 49A and 49B and 51 Albert Road. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its scale, siting and nature (roof extension) would not result in loss of daylight/sunlight or an overbearing effect in relation to all the adjoining properties.\r\rOfficers note concerns about loss of privacy raised in written representation in relation to the proposed sliding door and Juliet balcony. \r\rIt is noted that the separation distance between the rear elevation of the host dwelling to the rear building line of No 49 and 51 are over 21.2m, in accordance with Policy Guidance 31 Separation Distances, where the distance of minimum of 21m between habitable windows is recommended. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the size of the proposed door and Juliet balcony is greater than a regular window, however it would not result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or an undue overlooking that is materially different to a regular size window. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area can be summarised as: an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre comprising houses of various sizes and designs dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless contributes positively to the conservation area. As the proposal would not be highly prominent in the street scene and due to its modest scale, the proposed design and materials, it is considered that the proposed roof extension would not detract from the conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rGiven the nature of the proposal (roof extension), it is considered that proposed floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling, in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Alric Avenue.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing detached garage and erection of a single storey wrap around side and rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rOfficers note the approved planning applications ref no 22/03487/HOU for Erection of part single-storey, part two-storey side and rear extension and loft conversion including rear dormers and 21/04002/PAEXT for Erection of single storey rear extension (5.58m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height of 3m).\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as the proposed side extension would not be set back from the front elevation. However, given that the proposed roof form would join the existing roof over the front bay window and would be of similar style, the proposed side extension would visually appear as a subordinate addition, that is in-keeping with the host dwelling. The proposed separation distance of approximately 1m is noted. \r\rThe existing street scene contains dwellings of different architectural styles, some of them have similar front elevation treatment to the proposal. As such, given the proposed design and the scale of the side extension it is considered that it would not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project approximately 5.6m beyond the existing rear building line and would feature a flat roof with parapet wall of the total height of approximately 3.3m. \r\rIt is noted that the proposed depth of the extension exceeds recommended depths which are in this case up to 3.5m, as per Policy Guidance 33. However, given the permitted development rights of the property for larger home extensions (21/04002/PAEXT), the size of the application site and separation distances to No 49 Alric Avenue, the scale and bulk of the proposal is considered to be acceptable in this case. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe main dwellings to consider when assessing the impacts on neighbouring amenity are Nos 33 and 49 Alric Avenue.\r\rWith regards to No 33, it has been demonstrated (the drawing no 063 Proposed Elevations) that the proposal would pass the 45 degree test and therefore it would not result in unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. It is noted that the proposed eave height to the west elevation is lower (approximately 2.8m) to reduce impact on the amenities of the occupiers at No 33. \r\rIn relation to No 49, given the proposed height of the side extension and separation distance, it is considered that the proposal would not appear as overbearing when viewed from No 49 and would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Alric Avenue. \r\rWhile the proposed garage would not meet the current standards for car parking purposes, it can accommodate secure cycle parking.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
