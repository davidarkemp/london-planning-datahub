    "The proposed third floor extension and associated alterations, due to its height, bulk and detailing, would detract from the appearance of the host building which is an identified Building of Townscape Merit, and would detract from the general streetscene. The harm to the non designated heritage asset, albeit less than substantial, is not outweighed by public benefit. As such the proposal would be contrary to  the NPPF,  Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, Adopted 2012 and Policies D4 and HC1 of the LondonPlan 2021.",
    "The proposal results in a reduction of floorspace to unit 6,  which would be below the required space standards for a studio unit and would result in a reduction in quality of accommodation proposed as part of the development proposal. The proposal would be contrary to the NPPF, London Plan Policy D6 and Policy DM13 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012, and the NPPF.\r",
    "The proposed extension due to its design and siting, provides a poor quality of accommodation  for future and existing residents within the building  due to the proximity to  windows serving habitable rooms, and lack of private external amenity space for the new residential unit proposed. As such the proposal fails to comply with  D6 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions) and DM13  Housing Quality and Mix and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Residential Design SPD.\r"
