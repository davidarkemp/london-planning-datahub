    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The finished floor levels of the development to which this permission relates shall be no lower than those of the existing building and any electrical sockets or other electrical fittings within the development shall be installed no lower than 750mm above finished floor level.\r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of garage into habitable space, erection of first floor rear extension. Roof extension with  side and rear dormer and installation of 2nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rPermission was previously granted under 18/14553/HOU dated 14.08.2018 for Conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of rear extension to the first floor and erection of side and rear dormer roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion. Installation of two front rooflights. The permission was not implemented and has now expired. \r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and 1 objection has been received stating;\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThese objections will be considered whilst making a decision.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the design previously permitted has not changed. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As noted above the design previously permitted has not changed. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy and the same conditions applied to the previous permission would be applied again.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
