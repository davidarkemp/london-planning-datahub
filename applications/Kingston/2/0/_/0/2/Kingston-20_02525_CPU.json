The site plan should show all public rights of way crossing or adjoining the site and should also show access arrangements, all trees and hedges within the application site and on the boundary, including trees and hedges on neighbouring land.  The plan should be annotated with key measurements, including distances to boundaries. The plan(s) must be given a unique drawing number and be clearly labelled as Existing or Proposed Site Plan.
