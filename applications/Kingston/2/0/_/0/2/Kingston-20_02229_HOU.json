    "There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The local planning authority must be satisfied that the amendment sought is non-material in order to grant an application under section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\rThe application seeks to vary the plans approved via 21/01775/HOU (Erection of single storey rear extension, front porch extension and changes to fenestration to garage) to allow an increase in height from 3m to 3.08m to the single storey rear extension and alterations to the fenestration to the rear elevation. It is considered that a increase in height by 8cm would not give rise to amenity or design/character and appearance considerations. \r\rConditions imposed via 21/01775/HOU would still apply such as condition 2 requiring matching materials.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe site forms part of the silverglade industrial estate a Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSISs).  The site is also located in the designated green belt. \r\r\rAssessment\r\rPlanning permission is sought for the change of use from a gymnasium to a a mixed use Use Class E(g), B2 and B8. \r\rThe proposal would be located in the designated green belt in an existing building. The proposal is to reuse the building and proposes no structural or external alterations or extensions. The paragraph 150 of the NPPF states that the reuse of a building in the green belt is not inappropriate development and as such the proposal is consider to accord with green belt policy. \r\rThe nature of the existing use is such that it could be considered to be a community use. The applicant has advised that the premises have been marketed for a reasonable length of time for a continuous period since 2020 with a marketing board displayed at the entrance to the indistrial estate that the unit subject of the application forms part of. In that time it is advised that enquiries from other gym users were made but that the premises were deemed not suitable for their purposes. In addition the two gym operators that have used the site have been said to go into receivership. A number of gymnasiums exist across the borough suggesting that there is sufficient provision of the use elsewhere and the history of the site suggest that there is no real need for the use on the site and as such the proposal would comply with policy DM24 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. \r\rThe proposed use is a commercial use either offfice, light industrial or a storage and distribution use. The unit is on an existing designated Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSISs) the Silverglade Business Park. It is considered that the proposal would be compatible with the uses on the site and the proposal would be sited in an appropriate location. The previous use of the unit was commercial of an industrial nature. \r\rThe proposal does not involve the alteration or extension of the exterior of the building and as such the proposal would have a neutral impact on the character and appearance of the host property. \r\rThe proposal is located on an existing industrial estate and and the residential properties on the Leatherhead Road in the village of Malden Rushett are some distance away and it is considered that the proposal would not cause harm to the residential amenities of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rThe unit is located on the existing industrial estate which has dedicated parking and service road and areas for each unit and the proposal is not considered to prejudice highway safety.  \r\rIn line with policy D12 of the London Plan a condition requiring the submission and approval by the LPA of a fire safety strategy statement is recommended. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

St George have also attended multiple job and career events to build relationships within the borough and meet with potential candidates looking for work.\r\rThe Council's Economic Development Team raise concern regarding local employment about 21% of procured spend locally for Royal exchange, as much of this was with once central london company that set up an office locally  to deliver this work. Improvements can be made in future for developments to secure more local labour, however, overall the submitted details comply with the requirements of the Section 106 agreement.",
