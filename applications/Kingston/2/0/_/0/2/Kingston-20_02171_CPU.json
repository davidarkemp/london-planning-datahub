    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is an area of open space to the front of 17-27 Angus Close.\r\rConsultation \r\r56 objections have been recieved. The objections can be summarised as follows\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r - Effects on trees\r - Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r - Inappropriate design/layoutAssessment\r\rAssessment \r\rThe proposal would provide two new residential dwellings in an existing residential area. The mix would be 2 x 3 bed dwellings which would be policy compliant. The internal floor space would meet london plan standards and would be of a practical layout. The amenity space would meet the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy Residential Design SPD standrad. The provision of 1 off street parking space per unit would comply with the london plan standards. Cycle parking and recycling and refuse facilites can be secured by condition.\r\rThe general architectural style and type of the porposed dwellings are considered to be symapthetic to and in keeping with that of the other dwellings in the existing streetscene and the overall estate. \r\rHowever it is considered that the proposed development would not be in keeping with the general pattern of development in the area in terms of its positioning in relation to the neighbouring properties and its context to its surroundings. The proposal would erode the open character of this part of the estate which serves to provide a visual break and relief from and softens the built form of the estate and the development proposed would create an incongruous addition that would be a dominant, overbearing and visually intrusive addition to the streetscene, create visual clutter and would appear a cramped form of development that would detract from the character and appearance of the area.\r\rFurthermore it is considered  that the proposed development would erode the open vista in front of 17 - 27 Angus Close creating an unnecessary sense ofenclosure and loss of outlook to the neighbouring occupiers causing undue demonstrable harm to the residential amenities and existing living conditions of the neoighbouring occupiers. \r\rThe proposed development will result in the loss of a number of trees. The trees in this part of the estate are considered to provide a soft verdant visual relief in the built form of the estate and their loss would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area detracting from the character and appearance of the streetscene. \r\rThe proposed development would result in the loss of parking spaces in the estate and it is considered when coupled with the increased demand for parking created by the proposed development the loss is likely to give rise to increased demand for on street parking and exacerbate existing on street parking pressures and lead to congestion and prejudice highway safety. The proposed development would not be in accordance with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rIt is considered the porposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties would have substandard separation distance between the proposed properties and the existing neighbouring properties resulting in adverse mutual overlooking of habital room windows and private amenity space to the detiment of existing and future living conditions of neighbouring occupiers and the occupiers of the proposed development. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development by virtue of the size, siting and design of the boundary treatment creates an unnecessary sense  of enclosure to the side and rear of the proposed development along the access paths to the neighbouring properties which  would create a hostile environment and a number of blind spots that could give rise to the risk of anti-social behaviour and crime putting at risk the safety of local residents and their visitors.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, it is considered that the public benefit of providing two net rsidential 3 bed units in the absence of 5 year housing supply would not be outweighed by the disbenefits of the harmful impact on the openess of the character and appearance of the area, the harmful impact on outlook of neighbouring occupiers, the harmful impact on trees, the harmful impact on, on street parking pressures and highway safety, the harmful impact on public safety and the harmful impact on the privacy of existing and future occupiers of the neighbouring and proposed development sites and as such the proposed development is considered to be not in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than it to be not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.
