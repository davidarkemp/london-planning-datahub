    "The application site relates to a detached property to the north of Elm Road, Kingston Upon Thames.\r\rThe site is not listed or locally, listed and is not located within a Conservation Area.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability).\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified. No comments received.\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r21/01830/HOU - Demolition of existing conservatory and erection of single storey rear/side extension - Refused 02 Aug 2021\r13/12804/HOU- Erection of 'piggy back' style roof extension. Refused 15 Nov 2013\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign and Character \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rFire Strategy\r\rDesign and Character \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rA single storey extension is proposed that extends to the side and rear of the existing building, replacing an existing conservatory. The extension extends the full width of the property but is reduced in depth in comparison to the existing conservatory and extends approx. 2m beyond the primary rear elevation of the building. The extension has an interesting and varying roof profile which ranges in height between approx. 2.4m at the eaves and 3.6m at the ridge. \r\rThe extension is proportionate in scale and has an interesting contemporary design that is compatible with the host dwelling. \rThe extension has been reduced in depth and height in comparison to the previously refused application (21/01830/HOU) and now comprises of yellow stock brick and a tiled roof to match the existing building. For these reasons, the reason for refusal for this application is considered to have been addressed. \r\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: \rThe site is adjoined by No. 167 Elm Road to the west and 171 Elm Road to the east. \r\rThe proposed extension extends approx. 5.2m along the boundary with 167 Elm Road at a height of 2.4m. Given this depth and height is not considered unreasonable, and as the extension is set in from the boundary by approx. 0.7m, the proposal is not considered overbearing for this neighbour. \r\rThe proposed extension extends approx. 2m along the boundary with 171 Elm Road at a height of 2.4m. Given the limited depth of the extension, the proposal is not considered overbearing for this neighbour.\r\rThe proposed extension would not interrupt the 45 degree line to neighbouring windows and so it can be concluded that the proposal will not result in an undue loss of daylight to these neighbours. \r\rThe proposal will not result in any additional overlooking or loss of privacy to neighbours. \r\rThe proposal is also not considered to result in undue levels of noise and disturbance or light pollution. \r\rFor these reasons, the reason for refusal for 21/01830/HOU is considered to have been satisfactorily addressed and the development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and the proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.",
    "Consultations\r7no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of existing rear outrigger, sunroom and ancillary building and erection of single storey rear extension.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, semi-detached property. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprises predominantly semi-detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe proposals involve the demolition of the existing outrigger and sunroom and the erection of a replacement rear extension measuring 6m in depth, and spanning the full width of the dwelling. Two glazed rooflights are proposed and a set of bi-folding rear doors.\r\rWhilst the proposed extension would far exceed the recommended maximum depth as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, and therefore not detract from its character and appearance. Officers note rear extensions approved to the same depth along Latchmere Road, including No. 83 Latchmere Road (under reference: 22/02197/HOU), the adjoining property. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rWhen taking a 45 degree line from the centre of the habitable room window of this neighbouring extension on the drawings provided, it would intersect the proposed development on the submitted plans, but not on the provided elevation drawings. As such whilst, the proposed development may result in some loss of sunlight to the closest habitable room at this neighbouring property it would not be to an unacceptable level. Furthermore, as the neighbouring extension is a conservatory, it benefits from a number of windows on its elevations, and as such levels of light to this habitable room would not be significantly reduced. \r\rIt is noted that the existing sunroom and rear outrigger occupy a built footprint closer to the shared boundary with No. 87 than that proposed by under this application. The plans show that the when taking a 45-degree line from the centre of the habitable room window of the neighbouring extension to No. 87 that it would miss the proposed development, and so, not result in material loss of sunlight to this window. Furthermore, the construction of a single storey rear extension is not considered unneighbourly, being a common form of development within residential areas, and the protection of the view from these windows shall not be considered in this recommendation.\r\rOfficers note that No. 83 Latchmere Road, the property adjacent has the benefit of a recent grant of planning permission for a rear extension to the same depth (i.e. 6m). \r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe application has been supported by a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES). This RES provides a brief justification for the development not requiring further information on fire safety by the following: The new extension is an enlargement of the existing layout to a single family home made under a householder application. It does not alter the existing fire escape route. It will be separated from the existing fire escape staircase by 1/2 hour fire rated doors. Whilst this justification is noted, Officers consider that details related to a Fire Safety Strategy should still be provided at a later date prior to the occupation of the development, and that ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
