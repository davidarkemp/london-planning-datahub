    "Application Site\nThe application relates to a site on the junction of Derwent Avenue and Grasmere Avenue, Kingston Vale. The site was previously occupied by a two storey dwelling but this has since been demolished (through planning application 17/14763/FUL). The site is within the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 1b (very poor) and is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability)\n\nPermission was granted under 22/00304/FUL  dated 29.03.2022 for the erection of two storey single family dwelling with roof accommodation and basement with associated amenity space, off street parking, perimetre wall, electric access gates, cycle storage and refuse/recycling store\n\nThis application seeks to amend this permission. Officers note the permission granted was not subject to a legal agreement. \n\nProposal\nThe application seeks to allow conversion of a single dwelling house approved under planning permission ref: 22/00304/FUL into 2nos of dwelling houses. It is indicated on the submitted application form that the development approved under the permission has not started.\n\nConsultation\n14 neighbouring properties have been notified and 1 objection has been received stating;\n - Access or traffic problems\n - Car park issues\n - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\n - Privacy\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- Principle of Development;\n\nPrinciple of Development\nOfficers acknowledge that an assessment was completed under the previous permission in relation to the suitable principle of development with regards to a single family dwelling.\n\nThis application proposes the creation of two separate dwelling with would need to be fully reassessed under the material considerations of such a development including future impact on the highways ect.\n\nInsufficient information has been submitted with this application that would allow officers to make a full assessment and therefore the local planning authority is unable to assess the accessibility of those changes\n\nIt is therefore considered that the proposed amendments would fundamentally alter the development approved under planning permission ref: 22/00304/FUL and as officers have been unable to assess the proposed impact of the proposed development fully, permission should be refused.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation. The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation and would  have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Flood Zone 2.\n\nProposal \nErection of first floor rear extension above the existing balcony.\n\nConsultations\n3 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- Flood Risk; and,\n- Fire Safety\n\nCharacter and Appearance\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension to replace the existing balcony, given its modest scale, siting and the proposed design, is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: \nIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nFlood Risk\nPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\n\nOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \n\nAs the proposal relates to the first floor rear extension and therefore the floor level within the proposed development would be set no lower than the existing levels, the mitigation measures are not applicable in this case. \n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

No  letters of representation were received.  \n\nProposal \nThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of existing rear extension ,erection of single storey rear, front infill and first floor infill  and first floor side extension. Fenestration alterations.\n\nPlanning History\n23/03187/HOU Demolition of existing rear extension, erection of single storey rear, front infill and first floor side extension. Fenestration alteration.\n\nApplication Site\nThe  site comprises a terrace dwelling.  \n\nPlanning Assessment  \nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\n- Fire Safety \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the demolition of existing rear extension ,erection of single storey rear, front infill and first floor infill  and first floor side extension. Fenestration alterations.\n\nThe existing rear extension is a conservatory and at its widest ('bay window) has a depth of 3.58m. It has an existing width of 5.31m. The proposed rear extension would extend a depth of 4.2m and width of 8.43m which would accommodate the further extension of the existing side extension. The proposed height of the rear extension would be 3.302 to eaves and 3.543m to the pitch of the proposed rooflight. Overall, Officers note that the proposed depth of the extension  for a terrace property would be contrary to Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD and therefore would not be considered to be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the dwelling.\n\nIn addition to the above, the proposal seeks permission for a first floor side extension  which would be accommodated within the reduced building footprint of the ground floor side extension. This additional floor level would result in a change of roof form of the side extension reverting from a flat roof to a hipped roof form arrangement. Overall, the addition of both the proposed first floor extension and the hipped roof form to the existing side extension would fail to appear subordinate or proportional and unduly reduce the gap between the dwelling and its neighbouring dwelling at no 47 Compton Crescent. This element of the proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in timers of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\n\nThe proposal seeks approval for a front infill to the dwelling between the garage and the front door in order to create internal floorspace to accommodate a shower room. Officers note this would be set back from the front building line of the property and this would be deemed acceptable.\n\nIn addition, Officers note the proposal also includes the introduction of a mono pitch tiled roof to front the garage, infill and the front door which would have an eaves height 2.786m and pitch height  abutting the main dwelling of 3.581m. This would alter the character and appearance of the front elevation of the dwelling and would be deemed acceptable. \n\nOfficers note proposed materials would match existing .\n\nOverall, the proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nThe principal property  to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at no 51 Compton Crescent.\n\nGiven the siting and depth of the proposed development hard on the boundary with no51 , it is considered that the proposed development would result in the significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room at ground level in comparison with the existing situation.\n\nIn addition given the siting and depth  of the proposed development along the shared boundary with no 51, it is considered that the proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development present an overbearing appearance in the location.\n\nOverall, given the size of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring no51 Compton Crescent, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of  overbearing appearance and loss of light. \n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nConclusion \nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

Changes to ground floor side fenestration .\n\nThe existing garage projects a depth of 4.8m and width 2.6m. It has a  single mono pitch roof with an eaves height 2.27m and 2.8m height abutting the existing dwellinghouse. \n\nThe proposed single storey  front extension would project a depth of 3.5m and width  of 4.284m. It would have a part hipped part flat crown type tiled roof roof with an eaves height of  2.4m and pitch height of  3m. 313.014 and extension  would project a depth of 4.8m  and a width of 2.6m.  The proposed front elevation of the porch would accommodate a window and the proposed left side elevation would present  a  single door.  In terms of proposed materials and finishes it would be rendered to match existing  and a tiled roof to match existing. \n\nPolicy Guidance 38 in the Residential Design SPD   states that when designing a front extension the following guidance will apply :\n- Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window\n- New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and be an obvious addition\n- Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation\n- The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house\n- All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties\n- Front extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported\n- Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.  main recommends all front extensions should be design to respect \n\nIn this instance, it is considered that the  proposed front extension would not be a subordinate and proportionate  addition to the  host dwelling  and nor does the proposed roof  match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house. \n\nThe proposed single storey rear extension would project a depth of 4m  and a width of 7.49m, the full width of the host dwelling.  It would have a flat roof with a proposed eaves height of 3m accommodating a single roof lantern. The proposed rear elevation would be rendered and present  patio doors. The  proposed flank walls would be rendered to match existing. \n\nThe proposed depth of the single storey extension would be contrary to the recommendation as set out in  Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD.\n\nOfficers consider that the loss of the front chimney would have an adverse impact on the streetscene  and would detract the architectural quality  of the dwelling. \n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale,form,bulk,height,massing , spacing, design . It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity  and the proposed single storey rear extension is neighbouring property at no 46 Mount Pleasant Road. \n\nDue to the siting, depth and massing of the proposed development along the shared boundary with no 46, the extension would clearly be visible from  the rear garden of no. 46  and it would constitute an unneighbourly form of  development  and present and overbearing appearance in this location .\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy (delete as appropriate).\n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a public house.\n\nConsultation \nNo response received \n\nKTCAAC - No objection \n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- Highways \n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \nParagraphs 195 to 214 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area and would enhance the character and appearance of the designated heritage asset the Liverpool Road Conservation Area and the non designated heritage asset the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy or noise and disturbance.\n\nHighways \nThere are no specific parking standards for a public house use and assessment is made on site by site specific basis. \n\nThe proposal would result in the reduction in car parking from 11 spaces to 6 spaces. The new parking layout would include a disabled space and be of practical layout and would not prejudice highway safety. The site is an area of parking control and it is considered that the proposal would not give rise to an increase in on street parking demand or result in local congestion on the highway network or prejudice highway safety.  \n\nOther matters\nA condition is recommended to require the submission of a fire safety strategy to ensure tha the proposed development complies with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \n\nThe site is located in an Archaeological Priority Area Tier 2. The nature of the development is such it is considered the proposal would be unlikely to have any impact on the archaeology of the area and it is considered that it is not necessary to have any archaeology conditions.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Consultations\n6no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Total of 2no. representations received, both objecting to the proposals:\n-\tProcedural faults (existing floorplan includes forecourt parking not owned by applicant)\n-\tImpact upon character and appearance of streetscene\n-\tHighways/car parking \n\nOfficer Comments: Duly noted. Please refer to body of report for full assessment.\n\nRBK Environmental Health Officer: No objections. \n\nRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comments.\n\nRBK Waste & Recycling: No comments.\n\n\nSite & Surroundings\nThe application site is located on the junction of Grove Lane and Balmoral Road.  It comprises a semi-detached two storey property with vacant retail on the ground floor and a two bedroom residential flat above. The surrounding area is predominantly residential in character.\n\nThe site is not listed or locally listed and does not fall within a Conservation Area.  Neither does it have any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on site or in the immediate vicinity.  However, it does fall within the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character (LASC) and Flood Risk Zone 1 (Low Probability).  \n\nPlanning History\n98/3022/FUL - Erection of part single, part two storey rear extension to form separate residential unit. Refused planning permission, dated 16th April 1998.\n\n16/12323/FUL - Change of use of shop space to residential, demolition of garage and erection of single storey rear and two storey side extension to form 2x 2-bed self-contained flats. Refused planning permission, dated 1 November 2016.\n\n21/03909/FUL - Change of use from shop to dwelling (use class C3) and erection of single storey side and rear extension. Refused planning permission, dated 1 March, 2021 for the following reasons:\n\n1. By reason of its excessive floorspace the layout of the proposed accommodation fails to make efficient use of the site and fails to optimise capacity of the site. The proposals are therefore contrary to Paragraph 125 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS10 of the LDF adopted Core Strategy 2012.\n\n2. By reason of the scale and proximity of the proposed single storey rear extension it would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon sunlight/daylight to No's. 2 and 4 Balmoral Road. By reason of the depth of the single storey rear extension it would create an unacceptable sense of enclosure for the residents of No's. 2 and 4 Balmoral Road and No. 57 Grove Lane. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\n\n3. By reason of its scale, the proposed single-storey rear extension element of the proposals, would constitute an overly dominant feature in the streetscene which would fail to respect the existing proportions of the dwelling, plot size or prevailing pattern of development, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character and contravening Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\n\n4. The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021 and provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012.\n\n5. Due to the lack of car parking provision the proposed development would likely lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network, inconsiderate parking, on-street car parking pressure and would prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\n\n6. The proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013.\n\n7. The proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\n\n22/02076/FUL - Change of use from ground floor commercial shop (Use Class E(a)) to dwelling (Use Class C3). Refused planning permission, dated 18.08.2022 for the following reasons:\n1.\tThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\n\n2.\tThe proposed development would likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\n\n3.\tThe proposed development is provided with inadequate cycle storage to serve the new development, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\n\n4.\tThe proposals would provide for inadequate means of refuse/recycling storage for future occupiers, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021, Policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\n\n5.\tA Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.\n\n\nPlanning Assessment\nThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\n-\tThe Principle of Development;\n-\tThe Proposed Standard of Accommodation;\n-\tImpact upon Residential Amenity;\n-\tThe Impact upon Highway Safety;\n-\tHighways and Transportation; \n-\tRefuse and Recycling;\n-\tOther Matters; and\n-\tThe provision of Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\n\nPrinciple of Development\nResidential Use \nPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011. Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\n\nAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\n\nThe proposed development seeks planning permission for a two-bed residential flat arranged over the ground and first floors of the building.\n\nThe principle of creating a residential unit within an established predominantly residential area is acceptable subject to compliance with Development Plan policies. \n\nLoss of / Reduction of Retail Floorspace\nParagraph 81 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021) sets out that: 'Planning policies and decisions should help create the conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business needs and wider opportunities for development.' \n\nPolicy DM17 (Protecting Existing Employment Land and Premises) sets out that the Council will protect all employment land and premises to enhance its vitality and viability and promote employment growth through regeneration initiatives including new and improved facilities, improvements to the quality of the office stock, access and public realm.\n\nPolicy DM17 is clear that alternative uses will not be acceptable unless it has been demonstrated by sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. Mixed use development schemes should not result in a net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) and should not compromise the viability of the site and/or its surroundings for employment purposes.\n\nPolicy DM19 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will support local shops and resist their loss (particularly convenience shops) in Local Centres and outside designated centres. Applications for a change of use that would threaten the predominance of Class A1 uses will be resisted.\n\nThe proposed development would remove retail floorspace which is also considered to be employment floorspace for the purposes of Policy DM17 above. There is no supporting rigorous marketing or evidence submitted to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for the ongoing use of the unit for employment/retail purposes. \n\nThe application site is not located within a designated Local Centre.  The nearest Local Centre is Villiers Avenue which is located approximately 100m to the south-east of the application site and comprises a mix of uses including a convenience store, bakery and café.  It is acknowledged that the existing ground floor commercial unit is isolated and vacant (asserted as vacant for six months), although the applicant has not provided any evidence as to the length of time for which the unit has been vacant.  A site visit revealed that the previous commercial use was a driving school office (use class E) which had been converted from retail use without planning permission.  However, it would now be immune from enforcement action due to its existence for in excess of 10 years.   \n\nGiven the proximity of the Villiers Avenue Local Centre and the range of units provided which are appropriate for the size of Local Centre, the loss of the retail unit would not have an adverse impact upon the ability of local residents to access local goods and services.  As such, the loss of the retail unit in this case is deemed acceptable.  The application is therefore considered to accord with policies Policies CS12 and DM19 of the LDF Core Strategy and be acceptable in principle in this regard subject to compliance with other Development Plan policies.\n\nPrinciple of Development - Conclusion\nThe proposed development would result in a net loss of employment and retail floorspace and no marketing or robust evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no demand for the ongoing use of the premises in an employment use. Whilst the proposal would result in a net loss of floorspace to a retail unit it is considered, in this particular instance, that its loss and conversion to residential use would be acceptable in principle.\n\nStandard of Accommodation \nPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \n\nPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                                           \nGIA\nThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the proposed dwellinghouse to have 2 bedrooms, and one further room labelled as an office/playroom. One of the bedrooms would be double sized and the other bedroom single sized.\n\nAccording to the standards, a dwelling of this size should have a minimum GIA of 70sqm.\n\nThe proposed dwelling would have a GIA of approximately 95sqm, in excess of the minimum standards. \n\nBuilt-In Storage\nThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for this size of dwelling is 2sqm. \n\nThe proposed dwelling would provide approximately 1sqm, which is below the minimum standard and is therefore unacceptable storage provision. \n\nBedrooms\nIn order to provide two bedspaces, a double (or twin bedroom) has a floor area of at least 11.5m2. One double (or twin bedroom) is at least 2.75m wide. \n\nThe proposed bedrooms would be well in excess of the minimum space standards, with the double bedroom to the front measuring approximately 18sqm and the single bedroom measuring approximately 9sqm. AS such, the bedrooms would be in compliance with space standards.\n\nCeiling Height\nAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\n\nHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\n\nThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed accommodation would meet the internal space standard requirements with particular regard to floor to ceilings. \n\nAmenity Space\nWith regards to amenity space for future occupants, the proposal provides a private garden for the proposed two-bedroom dwelling which totals approximately 60sqm. With regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the Borough's Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 10sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. In this respect the applicant has adequately demonstrated compliance.\n\nCharacter and Appearance\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \n\nDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\n\nAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\n- Recognises distinctive local features and character\n- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\n- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\n- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\n- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\n- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\n- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\n- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\n- Landscape setting and features\n- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\n- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\n- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\n\nThe proposals do not involve any external changes in the form of extensions and so would not result in any material change to the character and appearance of the building or wider area.\n\nImpact upon Residential Amenity\nParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\n\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\n- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\n- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\n- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\n- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \n\nIn this case No. 59 Grove Lane, 55 Balmoral Road and No's. 2 and 4 Balmoral Road are the principal properties that must be considered.  \n\nThe proposals do not involve any external changes in the form of extensions and so would not result in any material change to neighbouring amenity.\n\nImpact upon Highway Safety\nPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\n\nPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\n\nThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 1b (very poor). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum car parking provision in Outer London areas with a PTAL 0-1 of up to 1.5 spaces per dwelling for 1-2 bedroom units.\n\nThe site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (Zone G). It is noted that the proposal involves the loss of an existing garage to the rear of the site which is accessed off Balmoral Road. The proposed ground floor plan shows provision of off-street car parking for 1no. vehicle to be behind gates accessed off Balmoral Road. This is considered to be acceptable, subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement to prohibit the future owners/occupiers of the proposed flat from obtaining on-street resident parking permits. \n\nIn the absence of a signed legal agreement to prevent occupiers or visitors to the proposed unit from obtaining a residents parking or visitors parking permit to mitigate any parking pressures, the proposed development would not comply with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.  \n\nThe London Plan 2021 Table 10.2 requires minimum of 2no. cycle spaces per 2+ bedroom unit. The application form and accompanying plans do not provide for any dedicated cycle parking spaces. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\n\nOverall, the proposals are not in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 or Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\n\nRefuse / Recycling Management\nPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\n\nPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\n\nRefuse and recycling bin storage has not been shown on the submitted plans. As such, insufficient information has been provided of the proposed refuse/recycling storage arrangements at this site for Officers to make a considered assessment of the suitability of this aspect of the proposals.\n\nContribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\nAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\n\nFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 2 with a charge of £130 per square metre of residential development. \n\nThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\n\nConclusion\nThe proposed development would convert the ground floor space to residential use to merge with the existing residential floorspace at first floor in order to create a 2-bedroom residential dwellinghouse. As such, there would be no net increase to the Borough's housing supply. This is given neutral weighting.\n\nThe standard of accommodation is considered to be logical and would comply with space standards for a 2-bedroom, 3-person dwellinghouse. However, as with the previous application submission, there is limited dedicated storage space indicated against the minimum policy requirements and the applicant has failed to demonstrate floor to ceiling heights across the proposed development and so officers cannot properly assess this aspect. Both matters are assigned moderate weighting against the proposals. \n\nA fire safety strategy has been submitted as part of the application. This is given neutral weighting.\n\nThe proposal would include one off-street car parking space to the rear and so not result in a loss of the existing off-street parking provision. However, in the absence of a signed legal agreement to car cap the development and prevent the issue of on-street car parking permits for residents/visitors of this property, the proposal would exacerbate pressure for on-street parking and prejudice highway safety. This is given significant weighting against the proposals.\n\nAs with the previous application submission, the proposals do not demonstrate any cycle parking to serve the residential dwellinghouse and there is also no refuse/recycling storage indicated for the dwellinghouse. These matters are given significant weighting against the proposals.\n\nThe proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and it is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh any benefits associated with its proposed conversion to a single dwellinghouse, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\n\nIt is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \n\nRecommendation:\nThat planning permission be REFUSED.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\n\n4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to Inappropriate design/layout. Concerns regarding Party Wall Agreements and boundary matters as well as maintenance access are generally not material planning considerations.\n\nAll other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development.\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- Fire Safety.\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a total depth of approximately 3.7m (the same depth as the existing rear extension) and a flat roof height of 3.4m falling outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, the side extension would be highly visible in the streetscene and would only have a setback of approximately 200mm from the front wall. However, the proposed extension would still appear subordinate to the host dwelling. It would not be an incongruous addition to the street scene, as several dwellings on Seething Wells Lane benefit from similar extensions.\n\nThe proposed front porch would also not be an incongruous addition to the host dwelling or wider area as several dwellings also benefit from that type of extension. In addition, it would be small in scale and maintain a roof form that respects the host dwelling roof pitched roof.\n\nTherefore, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, massing and spacing. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\nThe proposed single storey side/rear extension would have a separation distance from the shared boundary with No. 18a Seething Wells Lane of approximately 2.1m, therefore, the extension would not cause an unacceptable loss of light to the nearest ground floor window at no.18a. \n\nRegarding No.20 Seething Wells Lane, the proposed extension would only past their existing single-storey rear extension by approximately 700mm. The BRE 45-degree test demonstrates that the proposed extension would not breach on both plan and elevation, therefore the extension would not cause a significant loss of light to No.20.\n\nGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\nThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\n\nProposal\nDemolition of an existing rear conservatory, erection of single storey rear, first floor rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 2nos front rooflights. Fenestration alteration.\n\nConsultation\n8 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- Fire safety. \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: Officers note that the property on the opposite side of Bonner Hill Road has been extended in a similar fashion but has retained the chamferred corner without the need for the roof to overhang. The proposed Hip to Gable extension would result in a discordant roof form at odds with the existing property and other corner properties within the streetscene. It is therefore considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would remain inline with the current outrigger and would not result in any loss of light to No. 2A Hawks Road.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Positive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner.

    "--- Officer Report ---\n\nIntroduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThe Development Plan comprises:\n\nThe London Plan 2021;\nRBK Core Strategy 2012;\nKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\nThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nConsultations\n6 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \n\nProposal \nThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of an existing garage, erection of single storey rear and side extension.\n\nApplication Site\nThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \n\nPlanning Assessment  \nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- Fire Safety \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the demolition of an existing garage and the erection of a single storey rear and side extension. \n\nThe existing garage  sits  adjacent to the existing dwelling  and projects a depth  of 5m,   width of 2.616m and flat eaves height 2.684m. It is set back from the frontage of the existing dwelling  0.347m. \n\nThe existing garage projects a depth of 4.8m and width 2.6m. It has a  single mono pitch roof with an eaves height 2.27m and 2.8m height abutting the existing dwellinghouse. \n\nThe proposed single storey  side extension  would remain set back from the frontage of the dwelling  by approximately 1m. Positioned hard against the shattered boundary, it would project a depth of 7.667m and width  of  2.87m. It would have a proposed parapet flat eaves height of 3.2m. Officers note part of the proposed side extension  would include the provision of a new garage.\n\nThe proposal also includes a single storey rear extension that would be partially conjoined with the proposed side extension. It would have a proposed depth of 4m, width of 7.746m  and parapet roof height 3.2m which would accommodate 2no rooflights.  The proposed rear elevation would present bifolding doors and a single window. The proposed right side elevation facing  towards no 4 Cromwell Avenue  would present a single obscure glass window  which would serve the proposed rear extension element of the proposal. \n\nIn terms of proposed materials and finishes  the walls will be rendered to match existing; flat roofing system and aluminium framed bifolding doors. \n\nOfficers note neighbouring no2 Cromwell Avenue has planning permission for the demolition and replacement of the existing side garage and erection of a single storey rear extension which would project a depth of 4m ( Planning Ref 21/02257/HOU dated 28.08.21).\n\nWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side and rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\n\nOverall the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the characters or appearance of the areas as a result of the proposals. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  \nGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\n\nGround Level / Base Level\nUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
    "Schedule 3 (Highways) Part 2, Clause 2.1 of the Legal Agreement of planning permission 22/01273/KPSID dated 08.08.2023 states that:\n\n'Not to commence the development until the details of the standards to which the Highway Works are to be constructed have been submitted to and approved in writing by the council.'\n\nThe applicant has submitted 009449 RYDTOL00 ZZ-DR-A-1003 REV P1 - Site Location Plan, 009449-WAL-XX-ZZ-DR-C-6800 RevP07 - Highways Section 279 Scoping Plan, and Cover Letter Dated 08/02/2024 which has been assess by RBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer. It is noted that the applicant is in the process of gaining approval for works under a Section 278 Agreement encompassing all works mentioned in plan 009449-WAL-XX-ZZ-DR-C -6800.\n\nOverall, it is considered that the details submitted pursuant to Clause 2.1 of Schedule 3 (Highways) of the Legal Agreement dated 08.08.2023 are acceptable and can therefore be approved.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\n\nUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\n\nThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\n\nThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 22/01104/FUL:\n- Modify internal layout following granted planning permission (ref:24/00095/NMA) for the removal of basements\n- Addition of 2no. new windows to rear elevation.\n\nThe Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent. This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
    "There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The local planning authority must be satisfied that the amendment sought is non-material in order to grant an application under section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The applicant seeks to amend the wording of condition 93 of planning permission no 20/02942/FUL to change the trigger for submission of details relating to the provision of the community centre and any associated indoor sport facilities from 'after consultation with Sport England prior to commencement of Block C in Phase 1' to 'after consultation with Sport England and prior to laying of the damp proof course in the external brickwork for Block C, Phase 1'. As the amended wording would not materially affect or change the approved development, the proposed amendment is considered to be non material.",
    "The site comprises a end-terrace dwelling. The site is located within Tudor Estate, a Local Area of Special Character.\n\n3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\n\nRelevant Planning History\n- 23/02681/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (8m in depth, maximum height of 3.26m and eaves height of 2.42m). Refused on 22.11.2023\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\n- Fire Safety\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application ref: 23/02681/PAEXT, which was refused due to failing to comply with Class A.1 (j) (iii) of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\n\nThe site currently has an existing rear extension with a depth of approximately 5.09m and a pitched roof height ranging from 3m to 2.5m. The applicant proposes to demolish the existing extension and erect a rear extension that would have a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.2m with an eaves height of 2.4m along the shared boundaries and a depth of approximately 6m, only 1m more than the existing rear extensions.\n\nOfficers acknowledge that the proposed rear extension would fall outside the guideline of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD concerning depth, however, officers acknowledge that similar extensions can be found in the immediate vicinity, on Tudor Drive and the extension would not be visible in the streetscene. Additionally, the extension would have a positive contribution to the site when considering appearance, rather than the existing two rear extensions.\n\nOverall, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would not cause significant harm to sunlight/daylight to neighbouring properties. Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \n\nGiven the siting and reasonable eaves height, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light or loss of privacy. Additionally, on the boundary shared with No.2 Tudor Drive, tall shrubs span the full length of the fence, therefore, the erection of the single-storey rear extension would not cause an additional oppressive or overbearing appearance, subject to a reduction in depth.\n\nGiven the sitting and height of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nHeritage\nParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\n\nPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\n\nOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD and would not significantly detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in significant harm to the Tudor Estate, a Local Area of Special Character.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\n\nIntroduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThe Development Plan comprises:\n\nThe London Plan 2021;\nRBK Core Strategy 2012;\nKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\nThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a ground floor commercial unit with residential use above.\n\nConsultation \nOne objection received and summarised as follows\n- Access or traffic problems\n- Car park issues\n- Fumes \n- Noise\n- Unacceptable or incompatible use\n\nRBK Environmental Health - Objection raised.  Insufficient information around the extractor system, there is no detail around filtration/odour control system and would not support an angled discharged flue and would expect to see a vertical discharge. The diagram included in the application shows a relatively low termination which is likely to attract complaints of cooking odour, and a loss of amenity to surrounding residents.\n\nAssessment\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- Principle of the use\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n\nPrinciple of the use\nThe proposal is for the change of use from a retail use to a restaurant use. Both uses are in the E class of the Town and Country Planning (Uses Classes Order) 1987 (as amended) and planning permission is not required to move between the two uses. There are no previous planning permissions on the site which restrict the use of the unit to a retail use only. As such no objection is raised in regards to the change from retail use to a restaurant use.\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nParagraphs 195 to 214 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated and non designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\n\nOfficer Comment: \nNo changes are proposed to the shopfront as part of the application.\n\nIt is considered that the proposed rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, and spacing. \n\nHowever it is considered that the proposed roof material PVC Roof sheeting would not be appropriate and would not be in keeping with the external finishes of the host property or those surrounding or be a material that would be encouraged by the LPA for such types of  development or sympathetic to the host property. The roof materials would detract from character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area and cause less than substantial harm to the non designated heritage asset the Berrylands Road Local Area of Special Character.\n\nIt is considered that the siting and design of the extraction system would not be sympathetic to the host property or the surrounding area and would be a visually intrusive incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and the surrounding area and casue less than substantial harm to the non designated heritage asset the Berrylands Road Local Area of Special Character.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nThe hours of use can be controlled by condition to prevent the use operating at unsociable hours, The shopfront would be fixed shut preventing unnecessary noise break out. \n\nIt is considered that the proposed extraction system by virtue of its siting would be visually intrusive and reduce the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers of the residential properties on the upper floors of the host property and the neighbouring properties.\n\nThe LPA's pollution control officer has raised objection in regards to odours and amenity stating that there is insufficient information around the extractor system, there is no detail around filtration/odour control system and would not support an angled discharged flue and would expect to see a vertical discharge. The diagram included in the application shows a relatively low termination which is likely to attract complaints of cooking odour, and a loss of amenity to surrounding residents. \n\nAs such the proposal would cause harm to residential amenity. \n\nOther matters \nThe immediate locale is the subject of parking restrictions and it is not anticipated that the size of the unit would give rise to levels of parking demand that would cause parking pressure in the area. The site is served by a local bus route the K2 and is in an area with a PTAL rated area of 4. The frequency and method of any deliveries such as takeaways and a service and delivery management plan and use of delivery drivers and method of transport used can be controlled by condition. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be not in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

However, it could be constructed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution. In addition, in the context of other houses in the wider area, this form of construction would not be unusual.\n\nOfficers acknowledge that the proposed hip-to-gable would cause a visual imbalance to the adjoining neighboring property No. 92 Villiers Road, as they do not benefit from a hip-to-gable extension.

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nHeritage\nParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\n\nPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\n\nOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would not be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD and would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, rather than preserve it. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would result in any harm to the Grove Lane, a Local Area of Special Character.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 6 (Construction Management Plan) of planning permission 23/01755/FUL which state:\n\nNo development shall take place (including any works of demolition) until a construction management plan has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved plan/statement shall be adhered to throughout the construction period. The statement shall provide for:\ni) How the proposed development will be built;\nii) Hours of working (which shall be limited to 08.00 to 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 to 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays);\niii) The procedure for loading/unloading materials;\niv) The route to and away from site for muck away and vehicles with materials;\nv) The protocol for managing deliveries to one vehicle at a time on sites with restricted access or space;\nvi) The protocol for managing vehicles that need to wait for access to the site;\nvii) Whether any reversing manoeuvres are required onto or off the public highway into the site and whether a banksman will be provided;\nviii) Temporary site access;\nix) Signing system for works traffic;\nx) Whether site access warning signs will be required in adjacent roads;\nxi) Whether it is anticipated that statutory undertaker connections will be required into the site;\nxii) The storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles;\nxiii) The potential for impacts from dust and emissions during the demolition and/or construction phase upon local air quality and surrounding residents;\nxiv) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works;\nxv) The location of all ancillary site buildings;\nxvi) The means of enclosure of the site, its erection and maintenance;\nxvii) Wheel washing equipment;\nxviii) The parking of vehicles of site operatives and visitors;\nxix) Meeting the requirements of the Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile\nMachinery (where relevant plant or vehicles are being used); and\nxx) The method of recycling and disposing of waste resulting from the demolition and/or construction phases\n\nDeliveries/collections to and from the site shall use a route that is agreed with the highway authority and the agreed route shall be signed accordingly.\n\nReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policies T4 and T7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within the Hook, Area of Archaeological Significance.\n\n5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\n- Fire Safety\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed two-storey side extension would not strictly comply with the requirements set out in Policy Guidance 36, of the Residential Design SPD, as it would not maintain a sufficient set down from the ridge line, however, it would be set back from the front elevation at first-floor level by approximately 680mm, in line with the SPD. Additionally, the proposal would respect the symmetry of the host dwelling pitched roof, as such would not appear out of keeping with the immediate area and wider Hunters Road streetscene or the host dwelling.\n\nThe ground floor rear extension would not strictly comply with the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth and height, and would not mirror the host dwelling roof form, however, it is considered that the proposal would appear as proportionate and subordinate addition to the host building.\n\nOverall, on balance, pfficers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\n\nThe proposed single-storey rear extension would only extend beyond the existing rear extension at No.97 Hunter Road by approximately 1.2m. Therefore, would not cause a significant loss of light to No.97. In regard to No. 93 Hunter Road, the applicant demonstrates a separation distance of approximately 1m from the boundary, therefore, the proposed development would be at a reasonable distance from the nearest ground floor window at No.93. \n\nOfficers acknowledge that the raised patio would cause an overlooking into the vicinities of neighbouring property No.93 and No.97 Hunters Road, officers will impose a condition to that effect, requiring the erection of timber fencing of 1.8m in height (when measured from the upper surface of the raised patio) along/adjacent to the raised patio. \n\nOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nHeritage\nParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application.

Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\n\nOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposed development would reasonably adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD and would not be visible from the streetscene. Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. It is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\n\nTherefore, the development would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would not result in any harm to the Hook, Area of Archaeological Significance.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The Local Lead Flood Authority raise an objection to the submitted details for the following reasons:\n\nThe Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) provided by the Environment Agency shows that the site lies in an area of very low risk of surface water flooding (meaning there is less than 0.1% likelihood of flooding occurring in a given year). An online version of this mapping data is available to view through the Environment Agency's Long term flood risk information mapping.\n\nThe applicant has proposed to discharge surface water at a restricted rate of 1 l/s into Thames Water combined sewer network. SuDS in the form of an underground attenuation tank, and green roof has been incorporated to contribute to sustainable surface water drainage by attenuating flow. Additionally, a hydrobrake device has also been incorporated. Infiltration and discharge to a watercourse has been discounted due to site geology/site constraints and absence of a nearby watercourse respectively. It is stated that \"Due to the soil conditions, which will provide a low level of infiltration, the size of the site and restriction on the proximity of soakaways to buildings (5m) and boundaries (2.5m) traditional soakaways will not be suitable for the site.\" However, the current proposal to discharge surface water to the existing combined sewer does not comply with paragraph 056 of the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) and policy SI 13 of the London Plan. Furthermore, the information shared by the Water Company with the Local Authority shows separate sewers in this location, and in accordance with the Water Industry Act 1991 a surface water connection may not be connected to a foul water sewer without consent of the sewerage undertaker. The applicant should aim to discharge surface runoff as high up the hierarchy of drainage options as reasonably practicable\n(in this case, into the surface water sewer). There is a surface water sewer that runs in front of\nAdelaide Road.\n\nThe applicant has stated in the drainage strategy that at the currently proposed discharge rate of 1 l/s, an attenuation volume of 10.44 m3 is required for a return period of 1:100 years, with a 40% allowance for climate change. However, drainage calculations are required to support this. Drainage calculations should be provided to demonstrate that the proposed drainage system (at the proposed runoff rates) can contain up to the 1 in 30 storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event should be safely contained on site. These calculations include details of critical storm durations as required. Drainage calculations should include all areas that contribute to the drainage system, including soft landscaping areas where they contribute to the drainage system.\n\nA surface water drainage layout has been provided as required to show the location of all proposed drainage components and the connectivity of the system. The layout as required also shows the gradient, pipe numbers and pipe sizes, together with storage volumes of the proposed underground attenuation tank. A revised drainage layout should be provided following changes in the proposed discharge point in compliance with the drainage hierarchy.\n\nA maintenance schedule for the surface water drainage system has been provided; showing the\nmaintenance tasks and frequencies for the tanked permeable paving, hydrobrake and other drainage components. It has been confirmed that the landowner shall be responsible for the maintenance of the proposed drainage system.\n\nThe LLFA do not recommend the discharge of this condition because of drainage hierarchy concerns and because more information is still required to support the discharge of this condition. To comply with the Planning Policy Guidance and the Policy SI 13 of the London Plan, the applicant should consider discharging surface water higher up the drainage hierarchy (in this case, a surface water sewer), or provide suitable justification where this is not feasible. Drainage calculations should be provided to demonstrate that the proposed drainage system (at the proposed runoff rate) can contain up to the 1 in 30 storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event should be safely contained on site. A revised drainage layout should be provided where necessary.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 13 (CO2 Reductions) and 19 (Fire Safety Strategy) of planning permission 22/01233/FUL which state:\n\nCondition 13 - Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, evidence showing that the development has achieved at least a 66% improvement in CO2 emissions versus Part L of the Building Regulations (in line with the submitted Energy Strategy) shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. Once approved, any measures necessary to meet the targets shall be maintained throughout the lifetime of the development.\n\nReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation, in accordance with policies CS1, DM3 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\n\nCondition 19 - Prior to any above ground works (excluding demolition), a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\n\n1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\n2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\n3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\n4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\n5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\n6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\n\nThe Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\n\nReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \n\nUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \n\nThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\n\nThe application seeks to amend the approved scheme 23/01314/FUL. \n\nIt is proposed to substitute the approved proposed floor plans and proposed roof and elevation plans listed in condition 1 of the permission to omit the side first floor WC window and add 6 ground floor windows to the classrooms approved. The scale and nature of the change would not alter the overall character and appearance of the approved scheme or change the approved building envelope, quantum of development or any other facets of the approved scheme.\n\nIt is concluded that the changes are not material and constitute a non material amendment to planning permission 23/01314/FUL.",
