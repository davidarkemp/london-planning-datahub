    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed telecomms development by virtue of its siting would not cause irreversible harm to the Willow Tree in close proximity to the development site and ultimately its eventual loss which would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with but detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Consultations\r12no. neighbours have been notified of the proposals. One representation received in support of the proposals to replace the windows with comment that the frames are currently in a degraded state of repair.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site, known as Old Mill Court, is occupied by a 3-storey block of self-contained flats.\r\rThe site is not listed and is not located within a Conservation Area.\r\rPlanning History\rNone of relevance.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal comprises the replacement of the original painted timber windows with double-glazed uPVC windows.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to:\r-\tPrinciple of Development;\r-\tImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area; and\r-\tImpact upon the Amenities of Neighbouring Occupiers.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe principle of replacing the windows of residential properties within a flatted development is acceptable subject to compliance with the Development Plan policies.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThis proposal seeks permission to replace the existing timber-framed windows with uPVC frames. There is insufficient information submitted as part of the application for Officers to properly assess the proposals. It is not clear from the submitted information as to which windows are included in the proposals and the proposed manufacturer's specification information for the uPVC frames is absent from the application submission. As such, Officers cannot adequately consider the impact of the proposals in terms of the proposed design, materiality and finish on the character and appearance of the application building and wider area, contrary to the policy objectives of policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rResidential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rGiven the nature of the development, it is not considered the proposal would not result in any adverse impact to the amenities of neighbouring properties.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rWhilst the principle of replacing/upgrading the window frames is broadly supported, there is insufficient information provided as part of this application for Officers to adequately assess the impact of the proposals on the character and appearance of the host building or wider area. \r\rThe proposals would, have no adverse impact upon the amenities of nearby residential properties.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than contrary to the development plan.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 20 (Acoustic Report) of planning permission 22/03217/FUL which states:\r\rCondition 20 (Acoustic Report) - Before the development is commenced a scheme shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority to demonstrate that the noise level of 35 dB LAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dB LAeq,8 hour during the night time (2300 to 0700 hours) in bedrooms, in accordance with BS8233:2014, shall not be exceeded. Noise levels in bedrooms should also not normally exceed 45 dB LAmax,F more than 10 times during the night time. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised. Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory standard of accommodation for the proposed units in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Please submit 'Drainage Plan/Statement.'",
    "Please provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
