    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and the installation of 2no. rooflights to the front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site relates to Hillcroft College. The wider site has frontages onto South Bank to the north, South Bank Terrace to the east, and Oak Hill Path to the south. The main College building is situated in the north-eastern part of the site, and comprises the main main house and adjacent stable block, which is connected at first floor level. This application relates to part of the site only comprisingâ€¦.\r'Hillcroft College including Former Stable Block' is Grade II Listed building, and the whole of the application site is located within the Oakhill Conservation Area. \rThe original buildings were constructed as a country estate known as 'The Gables', in the late 19th century, and were converted to a college in the early 20th century. Classrooms and communal facilities occupy the larger rooms at ground level, and offices, kitchens and ancillary functions occupy the internal smaller rooms. The first floor contains offices, and toward the rear of the main building and in the stables are former student bedrooms.. \rThe site has a PTAL of 4. A one way internal access road from South Bank  loops through the northern part of the site. There are areas for car parking for approximately 25 car parking spaces. \r\rThe site is within Flood Zone 1 (low risk). \r\rThe wider site area is primarily residential. \r\rProposal\rThis application has been submitted on behalf of  Richmond and Hillcroft Adult Community College (RHACC), and seeks the change of use of part of the college building to office use on a temporary basis for a period of 3 years.  The proposal specifically relates to parts of the first and second floor plans within the former stable block, with a total floorspace of 419.3sqm GIA.\rThe proposed office floorspace would be rented on commercial or discount rates and would be marketed as \"The Bridge Workspace\", as currently operated by the college at its Richmond site. The office floorspace would comprise individual rooms that would occupy the former study bedrooms: 62, 65- 75, 77, 79-80, an unnumbered study room, and a living room associated with a study bedrooms; plus a communal meeting room will occupy the space that was once office floorspace used by the college. The offices will be served by an existing kitchen area and toilets in three locations\r\rThe proposal relates to parts of the first and second floor plans within the former stable block that were previously used as bedrooms occupied by students intermittently during the week. Other space comprises storage and some college offices (marked as Eden). There is also one former student bedroom within the main building. The door at first floor level next to bedroom no.62 would be retained (but locked) and will form the line of separation between the college and temporary offices.\r\rIt is advised that the proposed temporary  change of use is sought in order to make the best use of the unused space (previously student bedrooms) to generate income for the college to fund their core business of education.\r\rNo physical works  are proposed and the application relates to the change of use only\r\rConsultation\rIndividual notification letters have been sent and the proposal has been advertised by site and press notice.\rNeighbouring Occupiers: No objection so long as no street parking permits are issued.\rSurbiton CAAC: No objection \rEnvironmental Health Service: No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Land Use; and,\r- Parking  and sustainable transport\r- Residential Amenity\r- Heritage\r\rLand Use\rThe NPPF  advises that Planning policies and decisions should support development that makes efficient use of land. Paragraph 82(d) of the NPPF requires planning policies to be flexible enough to accommodate needs not anticipated in the plan, allow for new and flexible working practices (such as live-work accommodation), and to enable a rapid response to changes in economic circumstances. . \rParagraph 93 of the NPPF  requires that planning decisions to a) plan positively for the provision and use of shared spaces, community facilities (such as local shops, meeting places, sports venues, open space, cultural buildings, public houses and places of worship) and other local services to enhance the sustainability of communities and residential environments.\rPolicy DM14 seeks the loss of housing of all types, particularly dwellings suitable for family accommodation.\rCore Strategy Policy DM17 seeks to protect employment uses.\r\rHousing:  The former study bedrooms are ancillary to the main use of Hillcroft College as for the provision of education college (F1). It is confirmed that \"none of these former study bedrooms do, or have ever, comprised permanent residential accommodation and so there will be no loss of residential housing. All study bedrooms at the college have only ever been used for a day or week at a time by students. Furthermore; they have not been used for a number of years as the college no longer provides such accommodation alongside its courses\".\rThe temporary use of this unused space  as a business  workspace hub, where rooms can be rented for private use is considered an appropriate and   efficient use of land, pending the wider redevelopment of the site for residential use, which is currently subject of separate planning and  listed building consent applications. \r\rHighways and Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy T6 (A) of the London Plan advises that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe offices would be accessed by pedestrians through the existing timber gate from South Bank that leads to an internal courtyard and from there access is provided to the building. The principal access to the college would remain to the west.\r\rNo car parking provision will be made for the offices. The site is located within a residential  CPZ (Mon-Sat excl Bank Hols 8am-6.30pm Zone T - Oak Hill) and is a short walk from Surbiton Station PTAL 4. Therefore it is not considered that the proposal would result in any significant impact on parking conditions and highway safety.\rA cycle rack would be provided within  a store room accessed from the courtyard and can also  be parked within the internal courtyard accessed from South Bank.\r \rHeritage\rNo physical changes to the listed building are proposed, either internally or externally.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIt is not considered that the proposed temporary change of use would result in any material impact on the amenity of residents, including noise impact. However, it is considered appropriate to limit the hours of operation to prevent undue disturbance between the  hours of 7am and 11pm daily.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed temporary change of use is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
