    "The proposed development due to its height, mass, bulk, design and materiality would present an unduly prominent building which fails to satisfactorily integrate into its surroundings. As such, the proposed development represents a feature that would be incongruous and out of keeping, resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 (Character, Design and Heritage), DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012).",

As such, the proposal would be contrary to Paragraph 163 of the NPPF 2019 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
