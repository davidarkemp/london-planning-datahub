    "The application site is located on the northeastern side of Kingston Road and currently comprises a restaurant at ground floor level and a residential unit above. The immediate surrounding area is mixed-use in character and the retrospective outbuilding is for the use of the restaurant.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations has been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers note that the retrospective outbuilding would have a large footprint, however, it would have a modest height of approximately 2.3m, maintain 270mm - 310mm from the neighbouring boundaries and given that it would be situated in a fairly substantial rear amenity area, officers consider that it would appear as a subordinate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe applicant is informed that the retrospective outbuilding would not be used for any other purpose other than ancillary/incidental use to the existing restaurant. In any case, a planning condition would secure this in the event of approval.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the retrospective development in relation to neighbouring properties and its use for storage, it is considered that the outbuilding would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, it does not sufficiently address the requirements of Policy D12(A). Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

The site is within Fluvial Flood Zone 1 and a critical drainage area with a small portion of the site at (along the northern and eastern boundaries) at risk of surface water flooding.\r\rProposal\r\rThis application is a resubmission of application reference 23/02687/NMA and is submitted under S73 of The Act as a material amendment to planning permission 21/02779/FUL (as amended by 23/02266/NMA). The application simply seeks to replace the following approved drawings: \r\rProposed Ground Floor Plan - NMH-ROCCO-0270\rProposed North Elevation - NMH-ROCCO-0470 Rev B \r\rWith: \r\rProposed Ground Floor Plan - NMH-ROCCO-0270 Rev B\rProposed North Elevation - NMH-ROCCO-0470 Rev D\r\rIn comparison to the approved drawings, the proposals seek to provide louvres and a door to the north elevation. \r\rConsultation\r30 addresses were notified of the proposal. No responses have been received. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Although the proposed alterations to the ground floor north would remove some of the previously approved active frontage, which is slightly regrettable, the resultant design nonetheless proposes more activation of the north facade in comparison to the existing building. The proposals would not dilute the quality of the previously approved design and are, on their own merits, considered acceptable in terms of design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r \rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  There would be no adverse impacts to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers as a result of the proposed changes. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.

Refused 02.02.2021\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe first floor extension is approx. 0.65m wider than previously approved but remains subordinate and does not dominate the rear elevation of the dwelling. A parapet has been added which is 300mm higher than the previously approved extension.   Whilst this extends above the eaves of the building, this is only a minor addition and is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area. \r\rThe ground floor extension has a flat roof compared to the previously approved pitched roof but this is considered compatible with the surrounding area.\r\rThere are minor alterations to fenestration these are minor additions that are consistent with existing building and surrounding area.  \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\r\rThe first floor extension is 300mm higher and 0.65m wider than the previously approved extension. These are modest additions and the building remains a significant distance from the adjoining property No. 28 Endway (approx. 3m) and 24 Endway (2.3m to the neighbour boundary) and so is not considered to be overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to neighbours. \r\rThe ground floor extension remains the same depth but now has a flat roof. Given the depth of the extension, and its height which is not considered unreasonable, this is not considered to be overbearing or result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight for adjoining neighbours, especially with reference to the previously approved scheme.\r\rConcerns have been raised by neighbours with regard to use of the first floor flat roof as a terrace. A Juliet balcony is shown to the rear facing second floor door which would prevent access to the flat roof and a condition can be applied prohibiting use of the flat roof which is considered to sufficient to avoid an undue loss of amenity for neighbours. \r\rThe alterations to fenestration at the first and second floor levels are modest and not considered to give rise to a level of overlooking that is beyond the established level of overlooking in the surrounding area.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). Had the development otherwise been acceptable, further details could have been secured through conditions.\r\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  2 letters of objections were  received and  raised the following concerns  : \r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/ layout\r- Loss of light/ sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rThese material considerations will be included within the assessment. Concerns have been raised with regard to the  multiple occupancy  of the property.  There is no indication in the submitted application this to be the case and would be seen to be a civil matter. This is a civil matter. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of the conservatory and the erection of a single storey rear extension and single storey outbuilding to the rear of garage.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History \r23/01907/HOU Demolition of conservatory and erection of a single storey rear extension, outbuilding and piggyback roof extension with the installation of no.1 front and 2 nos side roof lights to facilitate  loft conversion.  Refused 14.09.23\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would measure a depth of 4m  and would extend the full width of the house at 7.04m.  The proposed extension would be positioned on the shared boundary with  neighbouring no 25 Durlston Road. The proposed extension would be constructed of brick to match the existing. The proposed roof of the single storey extension would be partially flat accommodating 2 glass panels and the present a single aspect pitch roof with an eaves height of 2.773m and 3.774m height abutting the main dwelling . The proposed roof would be finished in felt and slate tiles. \r\rThe proposed extension would not be visible within the streetscene \r\rOfficer comment  :  Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rThe proposal also seeks approval for the construction of a single storey low pitched tiled roof outbuilding to be positioned behind the existing garage and adjacent to the shared boundary with no 19 Durlston Road. It would  measure 4.55m depth and 2.945m width, with an eaves height of 2.715m and a ridge height 3.171m. It would be constructed in brick to match existing. Sliding doors would be presented on the rear elevation. \r\rOfficers consider this proposed outbuilding would be proportionate and subordinate in relation to the host dwelling and would not be visible within the streetscene.\r\rOfficer comment  :  Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are neighbouring nos 19 and 25 Durlston Road.\r\rIn respect of no 19 Durlston Road, Officers note that the proposed single storey outbuilding would be positioned adjacent to the shared close boarded fence and  vegetation.  The proposed building line of the outbuilding would extend beyond the existing  building line of  neighbouring no19.   It is considered that the proposed development would not significantly adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of no 19 by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed rear extension would extend beyond the  building line of the existing outbuilding at no 25 by approximately 0.5m It is considered that this would not adversely impact on this building. Officers also note there are no proposed windows to be positioned along the side elevation facing towards no 25 and therefore there would be no issue in respect of loss of privacy.\r\rHowever, Officers have assessed the impact on the daylight and sunlight to no 25 using the BRE 45 degree rule and Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that no 25 has an existing rear extension presenting patio doors on the rear elevation  and a secondary window on the side elevation which would have an outlook towards no 23.  It is noted that the separation distance between the proposed  rear extension at no 23 and the existing rear extension at no 25 is 2.3m.  \r\rBased on  proposed floor plans, Officers consider that the proposal would not lead to a significant loss of daylight or have a significant additional overbearing impact and would not unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of no 25.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \r\rOverall, given the above it  is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "The application site is located on the northern side of Berrylands Road and currently comprises a newsagent at ground floor level and residential units above and to the rear.  The immediate surrounding area is mixed use in character and forms part of the Berrylands Road Local Centre.\r\rProposal \rChange of use from launderette (Sui generis) to newsagent (Use Class E). (Retrospective)\r\rConsultations\r17 properties were notified of the proposal and no representations were received.  \r\rRelevant Planning History\r23/01302/CEU - Change of use from launderette (Sui generis) to newsagent (Use Class E). Refused on 18.07.2023 for the following reason:\r\r- The change use from launderette (Sui generis) to newsagent (Use Class E) would require planning permission under the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Planning permission has not been granted by way of any statutory instrument or by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are;\r- The principle of development\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rThe principle of development\rPolicy DM17 states that the Council will protect, manage and enhance all employment land and premises in local centres so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods, services and employment. \r\rPolicy DM18 states that the Council will consider applications for new employment development (of an appropriate scale) in designated employment locations favourably.\r\rPolicy DM19 states that applications for change of use that would threaten the predominance of A1 uses (current Class E) will be resisted. It will also support local shops and resist their loss (particularly convenience shops) in Local Centres and outside designated centres.\r\rOfficer comment: The previous use of this site was a launderette which falls within Sui Generis of the Use Classes Order 1987, whereas a newsagent falls within Use Class E. As mentioned in the previously refused application (ref: 23/01302/CEU), moving between these uses would require planning permission that has not been granted.\r\rOfficers note that according to 'Google Street View Images' the application site was in use as a launderette as recently as 2019, therefore the retrospective newsagent has been in use for approximately 4 years. Therefore, officers consider that retaining the newsagent would not be incongruous and would be appropriate within Berrylands Road Local Centre and the above policies.. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The retrospective application does not involve any external alterations to the shopfront (the proposed new advertisement is subject to a separate application). As such there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the property or the immediate surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the proposed use would not likely generate additional noise as opposed to a laundrette, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of increased noise and disturbance. The hours of use are controlled by a condition. \r\rFurther, given that the floorspace of the building would remain the same, with no changes to the shopfront, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a ground-floor flat within the Surbiton Hill Park Conservation Area.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rSurbiton CAAC Comments: No objection. Minor modification only, no material impact on CA.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety  \r\rThis planning application seeks to obtain planning permission for the conversion of the existing garage to a habitable room and the replacement of the external garage door with a window.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement, however, the removal of this feature would be appropriate in the immediate vicinity of Parklands, as garages are not a common feature. Overall, this is considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its proximity in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not easily accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate replacement parking for a vehicle. \r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF (2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A small area of substantial mid-Victorian housing.\r\rAs previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in general keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers concluded that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Surbiton Hill Park Conservation Area.\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
