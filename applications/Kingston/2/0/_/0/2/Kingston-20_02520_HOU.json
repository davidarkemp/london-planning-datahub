    "The proposed single storey side and rear wraparound extensions would be excessive in scale and would be overly dominant within the street scene due to the incongruous mix of roof forms, lack of set-back from the site boundary and excessive bulk on this prominent elevated corner plot. The proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the wider area contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive depth, height, and proximity to the shared boundary with adjoining No. 9 Cranes Drive, would result in an undue sense of enclosure to No. 9 Cranes Drive, causing an unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight and limiting the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The  proposal would require planning permission.",
    "If you have evidence to contradict the local planning authority's assessment of the application, you are encouraged to apply for the development again and include that evidence in support of the application.",
    "Please provide the reason for this application as there are no TPO in the proposed site '1 Springfield Place' in our record."
