    "Consultations\rNeighbour notifications: No representations received. \r\rRBK Highways Engineer: No response received.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the southern side of Blakes Lane and comprises of a detached dwellinghouse.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. \r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not listed.\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the conversion of a single dwelling into 2no. self-contained units comprised of 1no 1-bedroom unit and 1no 5-bedroom unit, including vehicle parking, cycle storage and refuse storage.\r\rAssessment\rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the current NPPF and Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rPrinciple of Development:\rThe proposed development seeks to intensify the provision of residential units on the site that is located on existing residential land in a residential area. It is considered that the proposed development would be compatible with and would not change the existing primary residential use of the site. It is considered that subject to the detailed consideration of all other matters the principle of the development would be acceptable.  \r\rPolicy CS10 (Housing Delivery) of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that the Council will take every opportunity to deliver new housing. \r\rParagraph 60 of the NPPF 2021 states [inter alia] that to significantly boost the supply of homes, it is important that a sufficient amount and variety of land can come forward where it is needed and that land with permission is developed without unnecessary delay. \r\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThis application proposes 1no. net additional residential unit, thereby helping to contribute to these annual housing targets. In addition, the Council are currently unable to demonstrate a 5-year supply of land for the delivery of housing. As such, the 'titled balance' and Paragraph 11(d) of the NPPF 2021 is a material planning consideration. The final section of this report considers the planning balance of the application proposals. \r\rQuality of Proposed Accommodation\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021 sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.                                           \rThe proposed accommodation is considered to be of a practical layout with all habitable rooms served by windows. \r\rOfficers note that the proposals seek 1no. 1-bedroom, 2-person unit to the ground floor and 1no. 5-bedroom, 6-person unit arranged as a duplex. Policy D6 of the London Plan requires a minimum Gross Internal Area (GIA) of 50sqm for a 1-bed, 2-person unit and a minimum GIA of 110sqm for a 5-bed, 6-person unit laid across two floors. The proposed 1-bed, 2-person unit would measure approximately 85sqm and the 5-bed, 6-person unit would measure to 242sqm. \r\rSections have been submitted to demonstrate that the ground floor and first floor would exceed minimum floor to ceiling heights as specified by Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021. The ground floor is shown to have a ceiling height of 2.8m and the first floor is shown to have a ceiling height of 2.7m. \r\rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design Guide stipulates minimum of 10sqm per flatted unit plus an extra 1sqm per additional occupant. \r\rThe applicant has shown the rear garden space totalling approximately 800sqm as communal amenity for both of the flats. \r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rNo external alterations to the built form are proposed. As such, the proposals would not result in any difference to, or impact upon, the character and appearance of the area. \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy 2012 seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, daylight /sunlight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rNo external alterations to the built form are proposed. As such, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road networks would be severe.\r\rThe application site is located within an area that has good access to public transport (PTAL score of 3). The site is not located within a Controlled Parking Zone. \r\rIn terms of the application proposals, the London Plan Table 10.3 maximum car parking standards states up to between 0.75 - 1 car parking spaces should be provided for units of the sizes proposed. The applicant has stated within the proposals that 3no. car parking spaces would be provided to the front driveway, to include electric vehicle charging points. \r\rThe London Plan 2021 Table 10.2 requires 1.5 cycle spaces per 1-bed, 2-person unit and 2no. cycle spaces per 2+ bedroom unit. The cycle details provided as part of this application show four cycle spaces to the rear garden area. The plan appears to show this within an open cycle rack, however this would be required to be within a dedicated enclosure. Notwithstanding, the provision is considered to be adequate to serve the proposed development. Further details (in terms of design/materiality) regarding the cycle storage enclosure would be required by way of condition. \r\rRefuse & Recycling\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 require integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rRefuse and recycling bin storage is shown to the front of the property, positioned to the side of the vehicular entrance. Siting is considered to be acceptable and details of the design/materiality of the proposed bin stores would be required by way of condition to ensure satisfactory waste storage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 4 with a charge of £50 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rSummary/Planning Balance\rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5 year housing supply. \r\rThe proposed development would provide 1no. net additional market housing unit, of which one would be a family sized unit (unit with 5 bedrooms). The proposal would therefore make a positive, albeit limited, contribution towards boosting housing delivery within the Borough. \r\rThe proposal would not have an adverse impact on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, nor would the proposals result in any difference to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. These are neutral matters.\r\rThe proposed accommodation would be of a good standard in terms of living accommodation and amenity space which would carry substantial weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rCycle and refuse storage is considered to be appropriately sited. Further details would be required in relation to the design and materiality of the enclosures. This carries moderate weighting in favour of the proposals. \r\rIt is therefore recommended that the application be granted.  \r\rRecommendation\rGrant planning permission\r",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Demolition of an existing rear conservatory, erection of single storey rear, first floor side/rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 2nos front rooflights. Fenestration alteration.'"
