    "The proposed first floor side extension, by reason of its lack of separation from the shared boundary, would erode the characteristic gap between the property and No. 24 Endway, and would cause the two properties to combine visually to read as a terrace, resulting in unacceptable harm to the Endway street scene and to the overall character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "The proposal requires planning permission.",
