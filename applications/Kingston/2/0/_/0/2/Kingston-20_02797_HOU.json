    "The proposed development would by virtue of its siting and scale, create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed terrace and the privacy screens, by reason of its scale and siting would be unneighbourly and would appear overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of these properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.
