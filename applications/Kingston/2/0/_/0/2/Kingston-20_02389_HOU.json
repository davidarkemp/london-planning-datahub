    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, form, bulk, height, massing and design, would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties at Nos. 19-21 Grove Crescent and would create an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the roofscape, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. It would also result in lss than substantial harm to the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rAlterations to existing lean-to including replacement of roof, and changes to front and North boundary materials, and installation of 2nos. side rooflights\r\rConsultation\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r\rIt has also been raised that there is no existing lean to, however, historic photos available online show that there was a lean to in place until recently from as far back as 2008\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed lean to will replace the recently removed lean to. Officers consider the proposed development to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regard to neighbouring amenity the principal property to be considered is No. 53 Elmbridge Avenue.\rOfficers note there is currently a tall boundary treatment between the two properties. The eaves of the proposed lean to would not exceed this fence so officers consider there will be no further loss of light. The proposed rooflights would not result in overlooking. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: While no Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021), Officers consider that the proposal should be able to meet the requirements of Policy D12(A). Were the application otherwise acceptable, a Fire Strategy would be secured by way of a planning condition. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Thr proposed roof plan shows 2nos front and 2nos rear rooflignts, where as the proposed elevations do not show any rooflights, please clarify and amend the documents."
