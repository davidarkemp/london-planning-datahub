    "The accommodation hereby permitted shall be occupied solely for purposes incidental or ancillary to the occupation and enjoyment of the application property as a single dwelling and shall not be used as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings.",
    "No development including demolition works shall take place until a tree protection plan has been submitted to and been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rThe tree protection plan shall demonstrate that any trees on the site which are shown as being retained shall be protected by way of fencing which meets the requirements of BS5837: 2005 \"Protection of Trees on Construction Sites\" (figures 4 and 5). The fenced area(s) shall be kept entirely free at all times of vehicles, vehicle movements, equipment and machinery.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling situated within a new build development dating from the 1990s on former MOD land.\r\rProposal\rErection of first floor side extension\r\rThis application follows recently refused application 22/03191/HOU dated 05.12.2022 for the erection of first floor side extension and alteration to roof with hip to gable roof extension which was refused for the following reason:\r\r1) By reason of scale, mass and design, the proposed first floor side extension with hip-to-gable roof extension would appear overly dominant, would result in the loss of the characteristic cat slide roof diminishing the visual separation between the application dwelling and No. 35 to the south which would result in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene which would erode the character of the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis reason for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful.\r\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. The most appropriate form of roof extension will depend on the style and character of the house on which it is\rproposed. \r\rTo address the previous reason for refusal the proposed roof would now be pitched to better reflect the surrounding properties. This would reduce the bulky appearance of the previous Hip to Gable roofline and would also improve the visual separation between the application dwelling and neighbouring No. 35 Coppard Gardens. Officers acknowledge that the proposal would result in the loss of the catslide roof feature but also note the lack of catslide roofs within the area. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. Officers therefore consider the previous reason for refusal has been addressed.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the existing situation on site, officers consider that it would not appear overbearing and unduly deprive\rneighbouring occupiers of natural light.  The proposed extensions would comply with current BRE guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight to the nearest windows at both adjoining properties. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing rear conservatory, partial conversion of garage into habitable space. Erection of two storey side, single storey rear extension. Rear dormer roof extension including rear juliet balcony and 3 nos front rooflights. Installation of solar panels.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received in support of the proposal.\rTwo representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Effects on trees\r- Noise\r\rAny matters controlled under non-planning laws such as ownership of the site, right to light, building regulations or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment.\r\rAny other concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the previously refused scheme ref no 23/00662/HOU. The new element of the proposal is the installation of solar panels.\r\rGiven the scale, proposed materials and the proposed fenestration to the front elevation, it is considered that the proposed  two storey side extension and conversion of the existing garage into habitable and store space would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. It is noted that the proposed separation gaps would be of similar width to the existing separation distance to the immediately adjoining properties. As such this element of the proposal would not have a significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rIt is acknowledged that installation of solar panels then would not protrude more than 200 mm from the existing roof slope and would not exceed the highest part of the existing roof is likely to fall within the permitted development rights. While the installation of solar panels over the proposed rear dormer roof would not benefit from this fall-back position, given its siting (located towards the rear) and that they would not protrude more than 200 mm from the roof level and in context of the proposed solar panels installed to the front, it is considered that this part of the proposal would not have significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rWith regards to the proposed rear dormer roof extension, it is acknowledged that it would be in conflict with Policy Guidance 39, as the dormer would not be set down from the existing roof line by the recommended minimum distance of 500mm. However, given the presence of dormers within similar settings and mass and bulk within the immediate surrounding area, it is considered that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area and therefore it would be acceptable. It is noted that the proposed materials would be similar to the existing ones. \r\rThe depth of the proposed single storey rear extension has been reduced to 4m when compared to the previous application. As such, given the proposed separation distances, depth and the total height of approximately 3m, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area, in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 for detached properties. \r\rConsidering the following amendments to the scheme such as an omission of the first floor rear extension,  reduced depth of the single storey rear extension and the proposed materials that would be similar to the existing ones,  the revised scheme would overcome the first reason for refusal of the previous application. \r\rOfficers note concerns raised within written representations regarding the character and appearance of the proposal. However, it is considered that the amended scheme and installation of the solar panels would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area and the proposed development would be in general compliance with the Council's  Residential Design SPD as explained above. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is noted that No 2 Brough Close benefits from the single storey rear extension and rear dormer roof extensions. No 4 Borough Close shows its original layout. \r\rThe proposed development due to its siting and scale would pass the 45 degree test and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to neighbouring properties. \r\rThe scale, mass and bulk of the amended scheme has been reduced (the proposal does not include first floor rear extension and shows reduced depth of the ground floor rear extension), it is considered that the proposal would not result in an overbearing appearance or an undue sense of enclosure when viewed from the adjoining properties and therefore the applicant has successfully addressed the second reason for refusal of the previous scheme. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed solar panels due to its siting and scale would not appear as overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties. \r\rWith regards to concerns raised within written representations regarding potential loss of privacy as a result of the proposed dormer, as there are existing windows to the first floor rear elevation, it is considered that the proposed dormer windows would not significantly change the existing situation. \r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the existing garage due to its size would not meet the current standards for car parking and therefore it does not count towards the loss of parking space. It is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that this provision may be located within the proposed store to compensate for the loss of garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rTrees\rThe application site is not situated within a conservation area and does not contain protected trees. The proposed works does not include a removal of any trees as declared on the application form. \rIt is noted that the Council's Tree and Landscape Officer raised no objections to the previous scheme.\rAs such it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect trees situated within the vicinity of the application site. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
