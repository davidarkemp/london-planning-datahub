    "The proposed single storey extension would  extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 4 metres, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (f) (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site relates to a detached property to the east of Kingston Hill, Kingston Upon Thames. \r\rThe site lies within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and an Archaeological Priority Area.\r\rThere are TPOs on the site.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability).\r\r28 neighbouring properties have been notified. No comments received.\r\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r14/14243/HOU - Erection of two storey side and rear extension with roof extensions involving a raise in the ridge height and rear dormer windows. Granted 19 Jun 2014\r\r07/14437/FUL - Conversion of garage to habitable accommodation. Erection of single storey rear extension - Granted 21 Jun 2007\r06/14838/FUL - Erection of first floor side extension and elevational changes to front porch - granted 15 Nov 2006\r\r98/6189/FUL - Erection of a single storey side extension adjacent to the northern boundary and a part single, part two storey, front, rear and side extension adjacent to southern boundary. Formation of new vehicle access onto Kingston Hill - Granted 16 Sep 1998\r\r93/1024/FUL - Erection of single storey front, side and rear extension incorporating a change of use of garage to living accommodation and formation of vehicular access - Granted 28 Oct 1993\r\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign and Heritage \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rFire Strategy\r\rDesign and Heritage\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rLocal policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) require that proposals relate well to their surroundings, recognise distinctive local features, have regard to the historic environment and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.  \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rThis proposal is for a roof extension in addition to other alterations to fenestration and to the materiality of the building. \rThe surrounding area predominantly comprises of large brick built detached residential dwellings sat in spacious plots with pitched slate roofs, albeit there is some variation in building style, form and design with some more modern buildings (including blocks of flats) of greater scale sat in larger spacious plots. \r\rWhilst the existing building is not of any architectural or historical significance, it is nonetheless prominent from Kingston Hill and is consistent with the predominant pattern and style of development in this area. The proposal seeks to replace the existing pitched with a steeply pitched crown roof that, whilst providing usable second floor accommodation, will introduce a harsh and dominant appearance that is incongrous with the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe Council does not object in principle to roof extensions to the building and it is noted that more sensitive additions to the building were previously consented through planning permission 14/14243/HOU.\r\rSome minor alterations to fenestration are proposed and the render is also proposed to the building facades. There are other examples of render buildings in this area and these aspects of the proposal are not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\r\rIn summary, the proposed roof extension, by reason of its design, scale and roof form, is considered to give a dominant and incongruous appearance, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, contrary to Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan and DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy. \r\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: \rThe site is adjoined by Yellowstones to the south and there are other properties to the north and south east on Winchester Close. \r\rGiven the siting of the roof extension, which does not extend outwards beyond the existing roof, and the separation and relationship with surrounding neighbours, the proposal is not considered to be overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to neighbours. \r\rThe proposal will introduce new windows at the second floor but any additional overlooking is not considered beyond the established level of overlooking in the area and is not considered to result in undue loss of privacy to surrounding neighbours. \r\rFor these reasons, the proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).\r\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is not considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for refusal.\r",
