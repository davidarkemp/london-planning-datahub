    "The proposed alterations to the boundary treatment and loss of an attractive open green space which forms a part of a network of open spaces within the wider estate would unduly enclose Horsley Drive and would respond poorly to the surrounding development and would detract from the overall layout and design concept of the estate resulting in an unacceptable and detrimental adverse impact to the character and appearance of the area contrary to Policy 7.4 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side/rear infill extensions. Changes to ground floor fenestrations.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notifed and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the limited scale of the proposed infil extension to the rear, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is therefore considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, due to the current situation between the development site and both adjoining properties Which have also been extended, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
