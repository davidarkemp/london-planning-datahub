    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and L-shaped rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate lost conversion and alterations to the soil and vent pipe falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "This application has  been submitted in pursuant to condition 2 (waste and recycling facilities) of application 22/01751/PAMA (Prior approval for the change of use from Retail (Use Class E) to 18no.x Dwelling houses (Use Class C3) at first and second floors.)\r\rCondition 2 reads: \r\rNotwithstanding any details submitted and prior to the occupation of the development, details of waste and recycling facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. \r\rThe refuse and recycling facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy SI17 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\rOfficer comment: The London Borough of Sutton and Royal Borough of Kingston Upon Thames Joint Recycling and Waste Technical Planning Guidance April 2021 sets out the collection and storage requirements for residential developments. Based on the total mix of dwellings proposed via 22/01751/PAMA and 21/02865/PAMA (34 residential dwellings) a total waste/recycling demand of 4,420L would arise. The size of the bin store would provide for in excess of 10,000L of storage capacity and as such sufficient space is available for a mix of storage receptacles. The bin store would comply with the general specifications and access requirements of the Planning Guidance. The details are hereby approved.",
