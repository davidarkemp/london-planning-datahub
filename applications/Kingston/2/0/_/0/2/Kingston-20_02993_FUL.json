    "The application is made for a certificate of Lawful Development or Use. \r\rSection 55 of the Town Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) provides a definition of the 'Meaning of \"development\" and \"new development\".' It states - \r\r'(1)Subject to the following provisions of this section, in this Act, except where the context otherwise requires, \"development,\" means the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land, or the making of any material change in the use of any buildings or other land.'\r\rSection 55 (2) states:\r(2)The following operations or uses of land shall not be taken for the purposes of this Act to involve development of the land—\r(d)the use of any buildings or other land within the curtilage of a dwellinghouse for any purpose incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse as such\r(f) in the case of buildings or other land which are used for a purpose of any class specified in an order made by the Secretary of State under this section, the use of the buildings or other land or, subject to the provisions of the order, of any part of the buildings or the other land, for any other purpose of the same class.\r\rThe applicant states that the current use of the site is C3 (a) dwelling house as defined by the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended).\r\rThe applicant states on their application form that it is their intention whilst working overseas for the next two years to rent out the property for short periods of time. Whilst this in its self may not constitute development through the material change of use of the C3(a) dwelling officers would need to have more detail as to how the property would be let. For example the LPA would need to know for example if it is to be let for the purposes of providing a temporary short term let as a primary residence or would it be for a holiday let? The LPA would need to understand the length of the let or lets also to understand if this constituted a material change in use.    \r\rAs such the LPA would require a fuller detailed submission to be able to make a proper informed assessment. The fact that a LDC may be refused does not preclude the submission of a further application if more detail is subsequently provided. A refusal to issue a LDC is therefore not necessarily conclusive that something is not lawful: it may merely mean that, so far, insufficient evidence has been presented to satisfy the LPA that the use, operation or activity is lawful. \r\rIt is concluded at this stage the information submitted to date is insufficient to allow the LPA to issue a certificate as the LPA with the information it has been provided cannot conclude with certainty that the proposed use would not constitute development under section 55 of the Town Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
