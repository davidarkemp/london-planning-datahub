    "Prior approval is not required for the proposed works which has been established via application reference 20/10735/PAEXT. The proposed extension and ramp are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terraced house. The application site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single-storey rear extension.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/02217/PAEXT Erection of single storey rear extensions (5.00m in depth, maximum height of 3.14m and eaves height of 2.89m) - prior approval not required, 21.09.2022.\r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth which are in this case up to 3.5m. However, Officers note that the application site benefits from permitted development rights, confirmed by the application ref no 22/02217/PAEXT Erection of single storey rear extensions (5.00m in depth, maximum height of 3.14m and eaves height of 2.89m) - prior approval not required, dated 21.09.2022. As such, given the permitted development rights fallback position, the proposed length of the single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable. The proposed eaves height of approximately 2.89m and total height of approximately 3m follows Policy Guidance 33 and is considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe proposal would not be visible within the street view, therefore there would be no impact on the existing street scene.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted daylight assessment demonstrates no unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to both adjoining properties as a result of the proposal. As such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
