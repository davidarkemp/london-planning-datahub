    "Please submit 'Fire Statement'. It is validation requirement.",
    "The proposal requires planning permission.\r\rThe assessment has been based on the original layout of the dwelling as of 1948. The available historic mapping from 1954 shows the layout of the house, which benefits from a staggered rear elevation:\r\rThe submitted photographs of the application site show the small outrigger to the rear which is considered to be an original part of the house. As such, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii), of Class A, part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rFurthermore, the proposed party wall would result in the development encroaching on the adjoining land and it would not be located within the site red line, contrary to Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rOfficers note the incorrect description of the proposal (the maximum height and eaves height were declared incorrectly on the application form). \r\rThe submitted plan 25-108 East (Right) and West (Left) Elevations suggests the eaves height of approximately 2.6m and the total height of approximately 3.7m, which is different to what has been submitted in the description of the proposal. Guidance on taking measurements could be found at https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/permitted-development-rights-for-householders-technical-guidance\r\rThe submitted drawings suggest that the proposed extension would be finished in pebbledash as the existing dwelling, as such it is considered that the proposed materials would be of similar appearance to the existing ones, although ideally it should be clearly stated that they would be of similar appearance also in terms of their color. \r\rOverall, it is recommended for the prior approval to be refused.\r\rThe proposal requires planning permission. \r"
