    "Officers consider that the proposal would comply with the criteria of Class M of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). Officers have also considered the details submitted pursuant to the conditions of Class M and are satisfied that they are acceptable.",
    "The development to which this decision relates must begin within a period of 3 years starting with the prior approval date.\r\rReason: This is required by paragraph C.2(3) of Part 3 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Prior to commencement of the development the applicant shall provide a scheme to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval detailing sound transmission reduction measures to be installed between the first floor flats and the ground floor commercial use. The scheme shall be designed to be 5dB better than that given in Approved Document E (2003 Edition incorporating 2004 and 2010 amendments) of the Building Regulations (Table 0.1a, page 12). Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to safeguard the amenities of the future residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the residential units the applicant shall submit a Car Parking Management Plan demonstrating the development as car free and how any future occupants of the residential units hereby approved will be prevented from applying for both residential and visitor parking permits for parking within any existing or future Controlled Parking Zone surrounding the application site. The management plan shall include a completed unilateral undertaking under Section 16 of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1974. The units shall not be occupied until the Car Parking Management Plan is approved. The units shall be advertised as \"car free\" in their marketing information for new occupants.\r\rReason: In the interest of highway safety, the surrounding roads have insufficient capacity to accommodate any further parking, and also in the interest of encouraging the uptake of sustainable modes of transport.",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received,.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed alteration to the erection of single storey rear extension would consist of the change from a pitched roof to a part flat, part pitched roof. The applicant also proposes to make alterations to the fenestration to the side and rear at ground level. The proposal is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposed plans state that the dormer will be materials to match the existing wall. This would fail to be of a similar appearance as the existing roof tiles so therefore would not comply with condition B.2(a).",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety  \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement, however, this form of development is not uncommon in the immediate vicinity of Hatch Place. \rIt is noted that the proposal would consist of a window on the slope of the roof at ground level on the front elevation. This would be of a relatively small-scale and would have a similar appearance to roof lights elsewhere in the vicinity. Overall, this is considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its proximity in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.
