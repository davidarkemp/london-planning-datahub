    "On the 22 October 2020 the Council issued an Article 4 direction pursuant to the Town and Country (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. The direction removes permitted development rights for the erection, construction, maintenance, improvement or alteration of a gate, fence, wall or other means of enclosure comprised within Class A of Part 2 of Schedule 2 of the Order.",
    "The \"resurfacing of existing bound surfaces\" would not benefit from the provisions of Part 7 Class J of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order (England) 2015. The proposed works do not fall within the curtilage of an industrial building or warehouse given that the previous use of the site as a Water Waters has been abandoned.",
    "The applicant should note that the footway/highway must not be blocked or used for materials storage without the necessary highway licence being obtained beforehand. Any incidental damage to the footway must be reported and the applicant would be responsible for covering in full any associated costs incurred by Highways in remedying such damage.\r",
    "The assessment of this application has been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings. If you carry out development based on incorrect plans you may be liable to the Council taking enforcement action against you.",
