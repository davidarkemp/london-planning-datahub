    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rRemoval of side access gate and partial demolition of associated wall. Erection of new timber fence and side access gate. Installation of 2no air source heat pumps and 1no air conditioning to side of house.\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. \rTwo representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inappropriate design/layout \r- Noise from the proposed plants\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\rOfficer response: The above comments will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the installation of the heat pumps and an air conditioning unit to the ground floor side elevation, due its scale and siting would be acceptable. The proposed plants would not be directly visible within the street view due to the siting of the proposed timber fence and gate. As such it is considered that the proposed works would not have sufficient impact on the existing street scene and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note written representations raising concerns regarding the siting, appearance and noise levels of the proposed plant. \r\rThe proposed plant would be installed to the ground floor at the side elevation that adjoins No 3 Langley Grove. Available planning history for No 3 shows provision of bedrooms on the first floor. The proposed plant due to their size and siting would not result in an overbearing appearance when viewed from No 3.\r\rThe noise levels for each of the units would be above 44 dBA (as per submitted manufacturer details of the plant, the air conditioning unit night mode would be between 41-47 and sound power level above 68 dBA, the sound power level for heat pumps are above 44 dBA). It is noted that the proposed units are approximately 1m from the shared boundary with No 3 Langley Grove and in proximity to a bedroom window. Given these site specific circumstances and the number of units, insufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the cumulative noise levels and any vibration would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring No 3 Langley Grove in terms of noise and disturbance, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
