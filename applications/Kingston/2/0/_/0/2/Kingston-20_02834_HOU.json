    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth and proximity to the shared boundary would result in an undue sense of enclosure and an unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight and outlook to the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 88 Cotterill Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
