    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The building hereby permitted here shall be used solely for domestic purposes incidental to the occupation and enjoyment of the existing dwellinghouse currently known as 49 Ullswater Crescent and shall be used for no other purpose/use whatsoever. \r\rReason: In order to safeguard neighbouring residential amenity in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation/use would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship with the nearby residential uses.",
