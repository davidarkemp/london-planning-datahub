    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The decision to which this permission relates shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of the granting of application reference 19/01848/HOU.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The accommodation hereby permitted shall be occupied solely for purposes ancillary to the occupation of the application property and shall not be used as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings.",

    "The site comprises a ground-floor maisonette.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r- Inappropriate design/layout; waste/drain pipe and side windows\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the property appears to be a leasehold, however, the applicant has confirmed that the correct Ownership Certificate has been signed and, in the absence of evidence to the contrary, the Local Planning Authority is satisfied that the correct Certificate has been signed. Where planning permission is granted, this would not override any property rights/other rights of the freeholder. However, this is a civil matter and is not to be considered part of the planning application. The matters relating to the waste and drain pipe are matters that would be dealt with via the building control regime. The concern with the side window will be addressed in the amenity section of this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 3m from the rear wall and a flat roof height of approximately 3m, in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. This would only slightly differ from the existing single-storey rear extension which has a depth of 2.8m, a pitched roof with a total height of 3m and eaves that sit approximately 2.7m. The proposed extension it would not be visible from the streetscene and would appear subordinate to the host dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 347 and 349 Park Road, as the proposed extension would not significantly differ from the existing rear extension. \r\rIn regards to the first-floor maisonette on site, No.345 Park Road, officers acknowledge that there would be some loss of garden space, however, the proposed extension would not involve construction on more than 50% of the garden, complying with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions. Installation of 3 front roof lights. \r\rConsultations\r9 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/03814/HOU Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion refused on 01.02.2023 due to the following reason:\r\rBy virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed rear dormer roof extension would constitute a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and would unbalance the adjoining semi-detached property. It would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r22/02312/HOU Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion refused on 09.09.2022 due to the following reason:\r\rBy virtue of its excessive bulk, scale and mass the proposed rear dormer roof extension would constitute a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and would unbalance the adjoining semi-detached property. It would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with Policies  D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r22/00257/CPU Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion granted on 24.03.2022.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the previously refused schemes for the roof extensions. The submitted drawings show the greater set in distances from the eaves of the roof of the proposed dormer and the reduced depth of the dormer. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed dormer would not be set down front the existing roof line by 500mm as recommended by  Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, however considering the proposed mass and bulk of the dormer and similar roof extensions with the surrounding area (Nos 21 and 23 Malden Green Avenue), it is considered that the proposed rear dormer would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed hip to gable roof extension with rooflights to the front roof slope is considered acceptable, it is noted that the existing street scene shows similar extensions.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
