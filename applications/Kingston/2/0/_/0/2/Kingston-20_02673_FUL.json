    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  the erection of part two storey and part single storey rear and side extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises an end of terrace dwelling \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a part two storey and part single storey rear and side extension. \r\rThe dwelling benefits from an existing side extension with the front section presenting a hipped roof arrangement and the rear section a flat roof arrangement.\r\rThe proposal seeks to further extend the existing side extension beyond the existing rear elevation  of the dwelling by a depth of 4m and overall width  of 7.5m. At ground floor level, the proposed side extension would not present new windows, however the proposed rear elevation would present large windows/doors. It would have a part hipped part flat crown type roof.\r\rAt first floor level, a side and rear extension is proposed which would be positioned within the built footprint  of the existing and proposed ground floor side and rear extension. It would measure a depth of 6.7m and width of 4.570m.   Officers consider the proposed hipped roof arrangement for the first floor side extension does not relate well with the roof arrangement  of the existing dwelling. \r\rOverall, the proposal  fails to appear subordinate or proportionate  in relation to the host dwelling in terms of its proposed scale, mass and bulk . As the dwelling is positioned at the junction of Burford Road and Idmiston Road, the proposal would be highly visible  and dominant from the streetscene and thereby impacting on the character and appearance of the immediate area. Furthermore the proposed  built form at first floor level together with the proposed roof arrangement   up to the site boundary  would create a sense of enclosure  in this location . \r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe dwelling is positioned on the corner of Idmiston Road and Burford Road, a prominent location . The proposal would be visible from the  immediate streetscene  and  in terms of direct outlook by the occupiers  directly opposite on Burford Road \r\rOfficer Comment:   It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance . \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \rErection of hip to gable and rear and side dormer roof extensions with installation of 2nos. front and 1no. side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rThree representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r - Effects on trees\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Fumes \r - Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r - Storage of hazardous substances (no further details provided by the objector)\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use (no further details provided by the objector)\r\rOfficer comment: \rAny matters controlled under non-planning laws such as building regulations or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment.\r\rOther comments will be included in this report. \r \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions to the rear of the property and installation of rooflights, given its scale and the proposed design is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed side dormer would be finished in lead cladding. Given its siting and the set down distance from the existing ridge of the roof it is considered to appear as a proportionate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rOfficers note that side dormers and lead cladding are not uncharacteristic to Traps Lane, the area comprising large houses of different architectural styles. As such, it is considered that the proposal would not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rOfficers note comments received within written representations indicating works to the front driveway/garden, however this application is only for roof extensions and any other works may require separate application if they amount to a 'development'.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised within a written representation regarding potential overlooking and loss of privacy as a result of erection of the proposed side dormer. A relevant condition would be added for any new openings and rooflights above the first floor level to side elevations  to be obscure, glazed and non openable below 1.7m when measured from the floor level to ensure no adverse impact on the occupiers of the adjoining properties. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
