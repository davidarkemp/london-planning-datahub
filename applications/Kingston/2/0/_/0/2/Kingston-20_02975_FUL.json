    "The existing property is characterised by steep roof pitches and a well-proportioned roofscape in relation to the principal elevation. The  resultant property, by reason of the introduction of shallower pitches and a higher ratio of brickwork to roofslope, would fail to respect the appearance of the original property to the detriment of its appearance and that of the surrounding area. The proposal would be contrary to paragraph 127 of the NPPF (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
