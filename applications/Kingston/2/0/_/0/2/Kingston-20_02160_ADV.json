    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwellinghouse.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is for a 2.8m deep terrace which would be located on top of the existing 3m deep single storey rear extension. The proposal also includes the erection of a 1.8m high and obscured glazed privacy screens.\r\rThe proposed development to the mid-terraced dwelling is considered unacceptable in terms of scale and spacing. The proposed terrace to the first floor and 2.8m deep and 1.8m high privacy screens would create a bulky structure to the terraced building which would be highly visible from neighbouring properties and the street scene.  It is considered that the proposal would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is noted that the site address is a mid-terraced dwelling and the proposed development to the first floor would be situated very close to the habitable windows of the adjoining properties. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
