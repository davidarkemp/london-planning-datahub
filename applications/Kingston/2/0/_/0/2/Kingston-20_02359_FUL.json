Refused planning permission, dated 28.05.2002.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe site comprises a detached two-storey residential property on the southern side of Richmond Park Road. The site does not fall within a Conservation Area, nor is the building statutory or locally listed.  \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; and \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rAccordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r-\tRecognises distinctive local features and character\r-\tHas regard to the historic and natural environment\r-\tHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r-\tAccords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r-\tRelates well and connects to its surroundings\r\rThe proposals comprise the alteration of the rear ground floor fenestration to the property to glazed folding/sliding doors.\r\rThe design of the glazing would be complementary to the existing fenestration and befitting of the overall design of the dwellinghouse, and is similar to other rear ground floor fenestration detailing.\r\rThe proposals are assessed as generally in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012). \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe full length glazed folding/sliding doors would be situated to the rear of the existing dwellinghouse. These would not afford any direct views or opportunities for overlooking to neighbouring properties.  The proposed one side-facing window at ground floor would face onto the flank wall of the neighbouring property, and would merely replace the existing side window with a slightly larger updated window.\r\rThe proposed windows are not considered to pose impacts on neighbouring amenity.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",

    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a terraced dwelling. It is noted that site levels vary between properties on the south side of Tankerton Road and that site levels fall away from the main dwellinghouse towards the rear end of the garden.\r\rIt is noted that Nos. 36, 40 and 42 Tankerton Road are all identified as being at low-medium risk of surface water flooding.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension with terrace\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbours were notified of the application. 1 letter of objection has been received raising the following concerns:\r- Insufficient details of surface water drainage;\r- Increased surface water flood risk on-site and to neighbouring properties;\r- Ground levels at No. 42 are approximately 0.15m - 0.3m lower than the application site;\r- Loss of privacy from the patio;\r- Height of boundary fence/privacy screens;\r- Loss of daylight;\r- Spread of Mares tail\r\rOfficer Note: Mares tail is not a listed plant under a relevant Act (such as The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 or the Environmental Protection Act 1990) so as to be relevant for planning purposes.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings;\r- Flood Risk\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that Nos. 40 and 36 are separated by an alleyway. The separation distance between the properties is considered sufficient to ensure no significant adverse impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, overbearing impact, undue sense of enclosure or loss of privacy.\r\rRegarding adjoining No. 42, as is noted above, the application site appears to be set at a higher ground level than No. 42. Taken separately, the proposed single storey rear extension would not result in any significant adverse impact to the amenities of No. 42. However, in order to mitigate the loss of privacy resulting from the proposed raised terrace, boundary treatment/privacy screens of at least 1.8m (when measured from the upper surface of the terrace) would be required. On the basis of the available evidence and submitted information, a solid mass of approximately 7.5m in depth at a height of approximately 2.5m in height (as viewed from No. 42) would be erected along the boundary with No. 42. \r\rIt is considered that the necessary boundary treatment/privacy screens and extension would, cumulatively, result in an unacceptable overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure to No. 42.\r\rFlood Risk\r\rParagraph 167 of the NPPF (2021) states that: 'When determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere.'\r\rPolicy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will require development to be designed to take into account flood risk from fluvial and surface water flooding and that development proposals will be considered in accordance with national guidance and the Borough Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA). \r\rPolicy SI 13 of the London Plan seeks echoes the above requirements. \r\rIt is noted that Nos. 36, 40 and 42 Tankerton Road are all identified as being at low-medium risk of surface water flooding. \r\rAs is noted above, the proposed terrace is shown on the Proposed Floor and Roof Plans as being 3m in depth, whereas the proposed section drawings show it as approximately 4.5m in depth at a height of approximately 0.5m. Based on the Section drawings, the proposed terrace would be approximately 25.2sqm in area. No details of drainage arrangements for the proposed extension or terrace have been submitted.\r\rWhile there is an existing patio area at the application site, it is considered that the proposed extension and raised terrace would result in an increase in the amount of impermeable surfaces on site. As a result of this, surface water discharge/flow rates from the site could increase. \r\rGiven the scale and nature of the proposed development, that the site and neighbouring properties are identified as being a low-medium risk of surface water flooding, and that no details of the proposed drainage arrangements have been submitted, Officers consider that insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development would not increase flood risk on site or elsewhere.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
