    "The proposed extensions and alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B.2 (b) (ii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of two storey rear extension with changes to fenestrations to existing building and internal alterations.\r\rConsultation\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified and 5 objections from 3 addresses have been received stating;\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise; and\r- Non compliance with the development plan\r\rThese objections will be considered as part of the officers assessment.\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that several properties within the surrounding area were designed with two storey rear outriggers namely properties on Elm Road which back onto the development site, so the principal of this design would be acceptable. Furthermore, officers note the presence of the existing rear two storey bay windows, though not as deep as the forementioned outriggers, still give an overall presence of depth to the rear. It is also noted that a number of properties within the streetscene benefit from large single storey rear extension up to 4.9m in depth (No. 58 & No. 56 Lime Grove). The proposed use of matching materials would not materially affect the character and apperance of the area. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, the principal properties to consider are No. 68 Lime Grove and No. 72 Lime Grove. With regards to No. 72 Lime Grove, officers note that the proposed extension would be 2.4m away from the adjoining boundary. The applicant has demonstrated compliance with regards to the 45 degree rule under BRE guidance, it would therefore also comply with the 25 degree rule. With regards to No. 68 Lime Grove, The proposed development would be set 2m away from the adjoing boundary. It is noted that No. 68 also benefits from a single storey rear extension. The applicant has also demonstrated compliance with BRE guidance in relation to No. 68. No harm has therefore been identified and it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
