    "The proposed extension falls within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey side/rear extension\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. \rTwo representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with the material planning considerations summarised as follows:\r- Loss of daylight/sunlight\r- Loss of privacy\r- Noise\r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side/rear extension would be set back approximately 7.7m from the front elevation and would abut the common boundary with the ground floor flat at No. 28 Borough Road. The height of the new party wall would be approximately 2.6m and the total height of approximately 3.4m. \r\rDue to its scale and siting the proposed extension would not be immediately visible within the street view, therefore there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The main property that would be affected by the proposed development is the ground floor flat, No 28 Borough Road.\r\rConcerns have been raised in written representations that the proposal due to its siting and height may have unacceptable impact on the levels of daylight/sunlight, outlook and would increase the sense of enclosure in relation to the ground floor flat at No. 28 Borough Road. \r\rThe proposed extension and the party wall (approximately 2.6m high) would project approximately 2.5m beyond the rear entrancehall elevation at No. 28. The proposed extension would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the opening that serves the porch/entrance and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight, even if the entrancehall were considered to be a habitable room.\r\rWith reference to the other openings at No. 28 which face towards the application site, these windows/doors serve a reception room, kitchen and utility. Of these openings, only the reception room would be considered to be a habitable room for daylight/sunlight purposes. While there would be some loss of daylight/sunlight to the reception room window and decking area it is not considered that this would be significant within the context of the existing two-storey outrigger and dormer roof extension at the application site. It is also noted that a 2m high boundary wall/fence could be erected under permitted development and within this context it is not considered that the parapet height of 2.6m for a depth of approximately 2.5m in depth would be significant or unreasonable. \r\rWith regards to  loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure, as the proposed extension would be viewed in context of the existing extensions at No. 26 and given its modest scale, it is considered that it would not result in an unacceptable loss of outlook or undue sense of enclosure. \r\rConcerns have been raised that there would be increased noise and disturbance as a result of the proposed extension. As the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling within a residential area Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties when compared to the existing situation. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Statement, which is considered acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
