    "Insufficent information has been submitted with the application to allow for its complete assessment, the following information is missing from the submission. \r\r1) You have not indicated in your submission the condition which you are seeking to amend\r\r",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey terraced building. \r\rPlanning History\r21/00509/HOU- Erection of single-storey rear extension (retrospective application)- GRANTED 04.07.2021.\r22/00886/HOU- Erection single storey front porch and rear extension- REFUSED 18.05.2022 for the following reasons:-\r1) The proposed single storey rear extension would conflict with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) in terms of its excessive depth. Combined with its siting along the shared boundaries of the site the proposal is not considered not to represent a development that respects the existing pattern of development, and the built form of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r2) The proposed front porch extension by virtue of its scale and design is considered not to represent a development that respects the existing pattern of development, and the built form of neighbouring properties. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rProposal\r\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a front porch and single storey rear extension. \r\rConsultation\r8x properties were notified of the proposal and no representations have been received. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed front porch would project an additional 1.5m (d) x 2m (w) from the existing front elevation with a pitched roof, rendered external finish and door. Based on the planning history of this site, it would appear that PD rights are available. Overall, taking into account the permitted development fall-back position, officers consider the impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the streetscene, wider area and the host dwelling to be acceptable.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth. However, following the refusal of permission in 2022 (22/00886/HOU), part of the flank walls of proposed extension would be stepped away from the neighbouring properties at Nos. 19 and 23 Woodlands Way. Taking this into account and the existing rear extensions to neighbouring properties at Nos. 19 and 23 Woodlands Way, the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the wider area and the host dwelling.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project beyond both neighbouring properties at Nos. 19 and 23 Woodlands Way and sited along the shared boundary. Officers note that although the projection would be beyond the neighbouring properties, the height of the extension is modest and any impact on outlook or sense of enclosure would not be significant. It is also noted that other properties within the vicinity of the application property have been extended to a similar depth.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider the impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties would be acceptable.\r\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The submitted block plan does not show the proposed development in hatched or shaded and does not show the adjoining rear neighbours. Please provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
