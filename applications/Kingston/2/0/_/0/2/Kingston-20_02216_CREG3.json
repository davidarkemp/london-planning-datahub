    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey front porch, part two storey/part single storey rear, first floor side extension. Roof extension with rear dormer, juliet balcony with inset terrace and installation of 3nos front rooflights.\r\rConsultations\r15 properties were notified of the proposal. Three representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Loss of privacy \r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rOne neutral representation has been received raising concerns  in relation to access or traffic problems during construction works.\r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as building regulations or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment. Other concerns will be addressed with this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the existing street scene that contains examples of part single part two storey side and/or roof extensions, for example No 26 (18/12903/HOU) or No 24 (18/12075/HOU).\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed first floor side extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to luck of setting down from the existing roof line, the proposal not being set back from the front elevation or from the site boundary, however given the siting of the proposal and the existing extensions with the immediate surrounding area this element of the proposal in isolation would be acceptable as it would be of similar scale/design and would not adversely affect the characteristic separation distances between the properties. \r\rWith regards to the proposed roof extensions, given lack of appropriate set in distances from the roof eaves and excessive mass and bulk, this element of the proposal would appear as a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to Policy Guidance 39. The proposed scale of roof extensions as well as provision of a balcony is not characteristic to the area. \r\rThe proposed front porch and installation of front rooflights are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns received within the written representations regarding the loss of privacy and an undue overlooking as a result of the proposed balcony.\r\rWhile the modest size of the proposed inset balcony is noted, given its siting it would overlook a number of rear gardens and rear elevations of the adjoining properties, resulting in an unacceptable loss of privacy. \r\rThe proposed openings to the side elevation above the ground floor level would be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m from the floor level, details of which would be secured via condition. \r\rThe proposed high level windows to the side elevation at the ground floor level, given its siting and scale are not considered to result in an undue overlooking. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and design would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of an unacceptable loss of light. The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the openings at the rear elevation at No 30. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

Erection of two storey side, single storey front porch and rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and Juliet balcony and installation 3 nos front rooflights. Refused 08.02.24\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to demolish an existing garage,erection of single storey front porch, side and rear extension . Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front rooflights include new smooth white render. \r\rIn combination with the proposed 3m single storey extension, the proposed side extension would extend a depth of 10.5m, a width of 2.6m and a parapet  roof  height of  3.1m . \r It would be set back from the existing rear building line of neighbouring no.31 Norton Avenue.   No fenestration is proposed on the flank wall. \r\rThe proposed rear extension would present a width of   8.24m  and a parapet roof height of 3.1m which would accommodate a single roof lantern.  The proposed rear elevation would present grey framed patio doors and a single window.\r\rIn addition to the above, the application seeks approval for a hip to gable roof extension  with a rear dormer extension.  In combination with the proposed single storey ground side extension, the character gap between the dwelling and neighbouring no 31 Norton Avenue is duly maintained and considered acceptable. \r\rWith regard to the proposed rear dormer, it does not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in  Policy Guidance 39 in the Residential Design SPD in terms of being appropriately set down from the roof ridge  and set in from the sides.   In terms of proposed materials and finishes, Officers note the proposed dormer would be finished  in a new smooth white render which would match the rest of the dwelling. However, in  reviewing other existing rear dormers in the area, the dormers  have been designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area  in terms of presenting matching materials to the existing roof form with the majority  clad with roof tiles.  On this basis, Officers consider the scale and visual appearance of the proposed dormer would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and be considered unacceptable.  \r\rThe proposed single storey front porch extension would extend forward  by 0.517m to be in alignment  with the existing front bay window and project a maximum depth of 0.991m  presenting an overall width of 2.37m.  It would have a dual aspect pitched roof. The proposed front porch extension would be considered to be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the dwelling.\r\r In terms of proposed materials and finishes, the proposal seeks to introduce smooth white render on the exterior elevations of the dwelling \r \rOverall, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale,form and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves the demolition of the existing garage space. Based on the existing floor plans, it does not appear to be of a size capable of fitting a modern car. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\r",

The extension would have a ranging depth of approximately 3.8m (on the boundary shared with No.8 Horsley Drive) to 5.3m (towards the existing garage). However, the applicant proposes a modest height of approximately 3.7m, similar to the existing conservatory on site. Additionally, the proposed rear extension would only be slightly visible in the streetscene and officers would not consider this harmful to the streetscene as the applicant proposes to use similar materials in the construction of this rear extension, therefore, it would appear as though built as part of the original dwelling. \r\rOverall, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe proposed extension would only extend a further 600mm past the existing conservatory on site and would be in line with the brick side wall of the conservatory at No.8 Horsley Drive. The proposed extension would not breach the 45-degree rule on both plan and elevation, therefore, there would not be a significant loss of light as a result of the proposed extension. \r\rGiven the proximity of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition.

However, the proposed single-storey rear/side extension would not be visible from the street and would not be incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAdditionally, the applicant proposes a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.8m with an eave height of approximately 2.7m, this is in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD and would aid in making the extension appear subordinate to the host dwelling. \r\rOverall, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylight of the proposed rear/side extension which would be a maximum of approximately 3.8m in height and 3.5m in depth (from the two-storey outrigger).

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.

The existing dwelling is positioned in a narrow and deep plot. The existing single storey lean to timber carport is set back from the existing frontage of the dwelling by approximately 1.2m. It has a width of 2.7m and  extends a depth of approximately 9m.The existing height of the carport varies presenting a front elevation flat roof  height of 2m and increasing to 2.25m towards the rear of the structure where a gentle single aspect pitch roof is presented.  \r\rThe existing separation distance between the car port and the shared boundary fence with neighbouring no 24 The Manor Drive is approximately 0.2m and then tapers to an abutting positioning with the shared boundary towards the rear of the structure. Officers also note the building line of the existing rear elevation of the dwelling is stepped. \r\rThe proposed side extension is to be used as a gym/ store  and would project a width of 2.7m, extend a depth of approximately 5.7m  and have a parapet roof height of 3m accommodating a single rooflight. It would reside within the built footprint of the existing carport and be set back from the front elevation of the existing dwelling by 0.889m. It would be constructed in red brick to match the brickwork of the existing house and no fenestration is proposed on the side elevation.  The front elevation would present outward facing double doors.\r\rBeyond the proposed gym/store,  the proposed side extension would continue 2.2m in depth and be stepped in by approximately 1.25m  leading to the main proposed single storey rear extension.  From this position, the proposed rear extension would project a depth of  6.39m  from the existing rear building line of the kitchen. The separation distance to the shared boundary wall with neighbouring no 24 The Manor Drive would be maximum 1.279m tapering down to 0.872m. \r\rFrom the existing rear building line of the dining room (closest to neighbouring no 28 The Manor Drive), the proposed rear extension would project a depth of 5.5m.  In terms of the proposed side elevation facing towards no 28 The Manor Drive, Officers note this would present a stepped elevation at 3.5m depth, stepping in by 1.13m . Within this proposed extension section, Officers also note that the proposed separation distance between the built form and the  shared boundary fence would be a maximum of 0.18m closest to the existing rear elevation and  would then reduce to  approximately 0.2m. Beyond this point, the separation distance to the shared boundary would be 1.25m  The maximum width for the proposed single storey rear extension would be 7.882m and a  reduced width  of 6.73m as a result of the step in.  It would have a parapet roof height 3.3m.\r\rThe proposed parapet roof height for the single storey rear extension would be 3.30m.  The proposed rear elevation would present grey upvc bifolding doors and no fenestration proposed on either side elevation. However, a single door is proposed on the side elevation facing towards no 24 The Manor Drive. \r\rIn terms of proposed materials and finishes, the proposed single storey rear extension  would be rendered off white and the  proposed roof for both the side and rear extension would be single ply membrane roof . Replacement windows proposed on the front elevation together with replacement hanging tiles. A window removed would be removed on the side elevation and  the pebbledash to be rendered.\r\rEven though  the proposed depth of the single storey rear extension would exceed the recommended 3- 3.5m depth as set out in Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD for semi detached dwellings, it does accord with the Policy Guidance  in terms of at least 50% of the rear garden remains and the parapet roof would be no greater than 3.3m in height. The extension would vary in depth  between 3.5m - 5.5m  to the rear  on the western elevation and  6.39m  deep on  the  eastern elevation forming a large/ deep addition although it would not compete with the scale of the main dwelling . \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey  rear and side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are immediate neighbouring properties at no 24 and no 28 The Manor Drive.\r\rThe  issue raised on potential  lightspill from the proposed rooflights on the flat roofs of both the side and rear extensions  is not considered to be a  concern as these are common features in such extensions.\r\rIn considering the impact on daylight at neighbouring no 28 The Manor Drive, given the height of the proposal and the orientation of the properties, officers consider that the proposal would be acceptable and would not result in a materially unacceptable loss of light.\r\rIn respect of neighbouring no 24 The Manor Drive,  Officers note that the proposed side extension would reside in a similar position  and scale to the existing carport. On this basis, it is considered that this element of the proposal  would not impact on the amenities of the occupiers. Officers also note the proposed rear extension would be set back from the site boundary by an acceptable separation distance and would be positioned  would be set back from the existing rear building of  no 24. On this basis, it is considered that this element of the proposal  would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of no24 The Manor Drive. \r\rOverall, given the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves the  loss of an existing lean to timber carport. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Officer Report\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rRetrospective application for amendments to previous planning permission ref 22/02784/HOU including increase to  height of rear extension roof by creation of small low level parapet, alteration to the new dormer size and its placement as well as removal of the rear Juliet balcony door and replacement with a window.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rTwo representations (from one postal address) have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed with this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the relevant planning history:\r\r22/02784/HOU for Demolition of existing conservatory and erection of part single, two-storey rear extension. Rear piggyback roof extension with 2no side dormers to facilitate loft conversion. Installation of 100mm external wall insulation to front and left elevations. Associated changes to fenestration - Granted on 12.10.2022.\r\rOfficers note the retrospective character of the current application.\r\rThe main differences between the approved application  22/02784/HOU and the current submission is the proposed total height of the single storey rear extension from approximately 2.7 to 3.2m (including parapet roof), the addition of fixed and obscure glazed windows to the side elevation, alterations to the side dormers and replacement of the rear Juliet balcony door with a window.\r\rAs the principle of the development as well as the character and appearance of the proposal has been established under the previous planning application  22/02784/HOU, Officers will assess the current changes to the proposal. \r\rThe proposed increase of the total height of the single storey rear extension from approximately 2.7m to 3.2m is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and in accordance with the recommended height in Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The proposed depth of the extension and materials would remain the same as per the approved scheme. \r\rThe proposed fixed and obscure glazed windows to the side elevation, due to their size and design are considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe proposed alterations to the side dormers in terms of their design and slight changes in their siting and size, due to their modest scale are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers note no changes in terms of design, siting  or volume to the approved piggy back extension, which is considered not to be materially different to the consented scheme.\r\rAs such, it is considered that due to the modest scale of the proposed alterations and their siting, there would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the concerns raised within the written representations regarding the loss of daylight, loss of privacy and overbearing appearance as a result of the proposal. \r\rIt is considered that the increase in height of the extension (approximately 0.5m) given its siting in relation to the existing rear building line at No 91A would not materially impact on the light and outlook in relation to the adjoining properties compared with the consented scheme.\r\rThe alterations to the siting and size of the side dormers, due to their modest scale and obscure and non openable windows below 1.7m when measured from the floor level, are also not considered to materially impact on  light conditions and outlook compared with the previous consented scheme ref 22/02784/HOU.\r\rThe replacement of the Juliet balcony with a window in the rear elevation, would result in a smaller opening, it is not considered to have materially different impact when compared with the previous scheme. \r\rWith regards to the potential overlooking, a relevant condition would be added for any proposed windows and rooflights above the ground floor level in side elevations to be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m when measured from the floor level. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a first floor flat in a three storey detached building.  \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of rear roof terrace and all associated works at Flat 3.\r\rConsultations\r27 properties were notified of the proposal. \r\rThree representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rOne neutral comment has been received regarding lack of structural calculations \r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as building regulations or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment.\r\rOther concerns will be addressed with this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: From the character and appearance perspective, the proposed balcony and patio door, given its siting, scale and design is considered to be in-keeping with the host building. Offices note the existing balcony that serves the other first floor flat. \rThe proposal would not be visible from Fassett Road, therefore it would not have an impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the previous application ref 23/01587/FUL was refused on 29.08.2023 due to the following reasons:\r1. The proposed development by virtue of its siting and design would give rise to a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers both within the residential block the application site forms part of and at the adjacent residential block causing harm to the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r2. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in noise and disturbance to the residential unit directly below and would not as result cause undue harm to the neighbouring occupiers living conditions. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rOfficers note concerns received within written representation regarding the potential loss of privacy and undue overlooking as a result of the proposal.\r\rTo address the first reason for refusal the applicant proposes an approximately 1.8m high opaque glazed screen to the side elevation of the balcony. The submitted drawing 182490-01-208D Overlooking Areas shows typical existing and proposed overlooking areas, which would not be significantly changed. However, it is considered that the proposed approximately 1m high clear balustrade to the front would allow for additional undue overlooking.\r\rOfficers note the planning permission ref  18/12647/FUL for 'Formation of a first floor roof terrace for Flat D, enclosed by 1.8m high privacy screen' granted on 12.10.2018 which seems to be implemented but not according to conditions, which may result in an enforcement action. \r\rWhile roof terraces/balconies are generally not supported as they often give rise to issues of overlooking/loss of privacy to adjoining properties, in this case the proposal could be acceptable subject to all the balcony screens being approximately 1.7m high and obscure glazed. \r\rWith regards to the second reason for refusal, the applicant indicates that proposal would be carried out in accordance with building regulations relating to sound and load and there is a similar existing balcony at the adjoining property. \r\rAs some flats at 48 Fassett Road benefit from either patio area or a balcony and considering the modest scale of the proposal, it is considered that it would not result in material increase in noise or disturbance.\r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rDue to the scale and siting of the proposal it is considered that it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to habitable openings at the adjoining properties. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, undue overlooking or loss of privacy subject to a condition relating to all the sides of the balcony being approximately 1.7m high and obscure glazed. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

Prior Approval Refused on 03.05.2024 for the following reason:\r\r1) The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation. The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation and would  have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\r- 21/02974/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (5.30m in depth, maximum height of 3.20m and eaves height of 3.20m).

Additionally, the proposed development would not be visible from the streetscene and subordinate and proportionate to the existing dwelling.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the proximity of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension and installation 3nos front and 3 nos rear rooflights.\r\r\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal seeks approval  for the erection of a single storey rear extension and installation of  3 nos front and 3 nos rear rooflights.\r\rThe existing dwelling  has an existing three storey  outrigger (ground, first and second floors) beyond which is a single storey w/c and storage  brick structure with a single aspect corrugated iron roof with an eaves height 2.617m and pitch height 2675m.  \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would extend a depth of 6.502m from the original  rear elevation of the existing dwelling and 2.5m from the single storey brick structure attached to the outrigger.Officers note the  proposed new rear building line would be in alignment with the existing rear building line with neighbouring no 71 Burlington Road. \r It would have a  proposed width of 4.602m  with the built form positioned hard up against the shared site boundary. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would have a parapet roof with a height of 3.3m. The proposed rear elevation would accommodate a set of patio doors. \r\rIn terms of proposed materials and finishes, the walls would be constructed in mixed facing brick to match existing ; the roof would comprise of a flat roof system; windows upvc to match existing and doors would be upvc and timber.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the depth of the overall  proposed extension would not comply with the guidelines in the Residential Design SPD. Policy Guidance 33 which recommends a total depth of 3.5m for terrace dwellings. There are no other examples within this terraced residential block.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design . It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylight  of the proposed rear extension using BRE45 degree rule and the Residential Design to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. In this instance, an assessment has been  undertaken in respect of neighbouring no 67 Burlington Road. \r\rGiven the siting and depth of the proposed development hard on the boundary, it is considered that the proposed development would result in the significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room at ground level in comparison with the existing situation.Thereby it would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers.\r\rDue to its siting and depth the proposed development  along the shared boundary with no 67, it is considered that the proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development and present and overbearing appearance in this location. \r\rOverall, given the size of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring property of no 67, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

Esher Wing is located closest to Wolverton Avenue.\r\rThe application site falls within the Wolverton Avenue Local Area of Special Character and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \r(Retrospective) Erection of a chiller plant room on the existing roof of Esher Wing Building and a new AHU plant room on the existing roof of the Esher Wing Building to serve the Medical Day Unit (MDU) on level 6. \r\rConsultations\rDue to the size and siting of the application site, 4 site notices have been displayed to notify the adjoining properties about the proposal. \r\rNo representations were received.  \r\rThe Council's Environmental Health Officer - no objections. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed plant enclosures, installation of air source heat pump and raised decking to the rooftop, given their size, siting and the proposed design are considered to be in keeping with the host building and the other existing plant enclosures. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not be visually intrusive and would not detract from the character and appearance of the host building or surrounding area. \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application.

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.
