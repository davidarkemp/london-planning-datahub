    "The proposed single storey rear extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to habitable room windows, an unacceptable overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 5 Manorgate Road by reason of its excessive depth and height along the shared boundary. The proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of adjoining property, No. 5 Manorgate Road, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed vehicular crossover would be within 2m of on-street traffic calming measures and the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed on-site car parking and vehicular access arrangements would not result in any adverse impact on pedestrian or highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed vehicular crossover would not adversely impact the nearby street tree which positively contributes to the character and appearance of the Manorgate Road Home Zone and the wider area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of rear dormer roof extension to facilitate loft conversion, and alterations to fenestration at rear and side\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application relates to the approved scheme ref no  22/02474/HOU for erection of single-storey rear and two-storey side extension granted on 03.10.2022. It is noted that the submitted photographs show that the approved development has commenced. \r\rThe proposal comprises a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and alterations to fenestrations. Offcers recognise that the description does not accurately reflect the proposal. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would measure approximately 8.9m in width and would be set along the entire roof. It is noted that the proposed dormer would not be in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended set in and set down distances, which should be at least 500mm. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed rear dormer roof extension together with the hip to gable roof extension due to its  excessive bulk, scale and mass would constitute a disproportionate addition to the host dwelling that would also unbalance the adjoining property. The proposed development would therefore detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. \r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its nature and siting would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwelling house located along Ancaster Crescent. \rThe site is not located in a Conservation Area or Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal\rThis application seeks permission for the erection of a single-storey rear extension and hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. \r\rPlanning History\rNone.\r\rConsultations\r6no. neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No representations received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- The impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rCharacter & Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure approximately 3.3 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse (at its maximum), spanning the full width of the property and would have a pitched roof, with an eaves height of approximately 2.8 metres. This extension broadly conforms to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, and would also appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. Officers therefore consider that this element of the proposal would also have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse.  \r\r\rThe application also proposes alterations to the roof including change from hip to gable and the construction of a rear dormer extension. \r\rOfficers note that a similar hip to gable roof extension has been implemented at neighbouring property, No.40 Ancaster Crescent (ref. 13/14336/LDP), as well as No. 38 Ancaster Crescent (ref. 21/01562/HOU). The hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer under consideration in this case would not strictly accord with the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013. However, they would be in keeping with the character of the original dwelling and would be similar to those approved works at roof level at No's 38 and 40 Ancaster Crescent. \r\rAs such, Officers consider that there would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse as a result of the proposed development. \r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rWhilst the proposed rear dormer would afford some views into neighbouring gardens, this relationship would be typical of the suburban pattern of development. It is considered therefore, that the proposed development would not affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties to an unacceptable degree by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design Guide, 2013.\r",
