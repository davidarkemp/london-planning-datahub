    "The proposed rear infil extension, by reason of its excessive depth and width, which would leave no separation distance from the shared boundaries, would result in an undue sense of enclosure and overbearing impact to adjoining No. 30 Deacon Road and limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property to an unacceptable degree, thereby conflicting with Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Portman Road.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of  single storey rear extension and alteration to fenestration.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal and the site notice was displayed. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would project beyond the existing, staggered rear building line by approximately 2.5m and 7.3m. The proposed total height would be approximately 3.2m. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depths which in this case are up to 3.5m. However, considering its proposed design and siting, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. It is noted that the separation distance to the common boundary with No 3 Portman Road of approximately 0.8m would be maintained. \r\rThe proposed alterations to the front elevation are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would project approximately 2.5m beyond the existing extension at No 7 Portman Road. Due to its scale and siting it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of daylight. Officers note two windows to the existing outrigger (kitchen area) at No 7 (as per available drawings for the application ref no 23/00529/CPU). \r\rWith regards to No 3 Portman Road, the proposed extension would pass the 45 degree rule and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to habitable windows at the ground floor level. It is noted that the windows to the site elevation ground floor level at No 3 are not classified as 'habitable'. The separation distance between the proposed extension and the common boundary of approximately 0.8m would be maintained. As such it is considered that due to the modest height of the proposal and the separation distance the proposal would not appear as overbearing when viewed from No 3. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Basement Impact Assessment - this is a requirement of Kingston's Local Validation List for all types of development which include new basements.\r\rThe Basement Impact Assessment (BIA) should address the potential impacts of the proposed scheme on the four main issues: \rLand Stability, \rStructural Stability, \rHeritage and Archaeology, and\rGroundwater and Surface water drainage and flooding from all sources.\rThe assessment should also include details of the expected lighting levels within the rooms contained within the proposed basement."
