    "T.35 Oak - Remove lowest primary limb extending over A243 (Upper Brighton Road) back to branch collar at main trunk. Crown lift secondary growth of remaining canopy to 2m above ridge line of house and match throughout. Reduce upper crown by 3m, Laterally reduce crown over road to south by 2-3m and laterally reduce crown over property to North by 2m, reshaping to give natural evenly balanced crown shape with all cuts made to suitable growth points and all deadwood and problematic secondary growth prone to failure removed.",
    "The tree in question is a large mature oak and the only mature tree cover on the property itself. It constitutes a part of the green corridor on the Upper Brighton Road and contributes significantly to the appearance of the conservation area due to it's high visibility to the public and it's subsequent public amenity value. It has been maintained over the years with a greater emphasis on reducing shade within the property and as such now has a heavier canopy ofver the road. The owner complains that the tree has been shedding branches and that these were not only deadwood but also live limbs and that this shedding is fairly regular and risks causing damage to the house itself and danger to it's inhabitants, however no evidence of limb loss can be seen or has been provided and neither has a technical report been provided by an Arborsit substantiating that there is anything wrong with the tree. There is also no evidence of existing property damage and permission cannot be granted for the removal of such a tree on the basis of possibility. It is plausible that the tree may have shed a higher number of small branches due to the two particularly long dry summers we have experienced. If this is the case then carrying out reduction works should help to mitigate this issue and reduce the demand that a larger crown exerts upon the tree whilst also reducing wind loading and likelihood of damage or limb loss due to storm events. It will also give an opportunity to reshape the tree appropriatley and remove any deadwood or limbs that are obviously prone to failure.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\n\nIntroduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThe Development Plan comprises:\n\nThe London Plan 2021;\nRBK Core Strategy 2012;\nKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\nThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\n\nRelevant history\n\n22/01542/HOU Erection of part single, double-storey rear and side extensions. Removal of 1no chimney stack, new porch and associated changes to fenestration. Refused \nReasons:\n1. By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling, within the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \n\n2. By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.11 Romney Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No.11 Romney Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\n\n22/03168/HOU Erection of a part single, part two storey side and rear extension and new porch. Refused \nReasons:\n1. By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling and would not be set-in from the shared site boundary by a minimum of 1 metre in conflict with Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would fail to retain characteristic gaps between houses and would be out of keeping with the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \n2. By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.11 Romney Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No.11 Romney Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\n\n\nConsultation\n\n6 responses received in objection to the proposed development. The objections are summarised as follows\n - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\n - Inappropriate design/layout\n - Loss of light/Sunlight\n - Privacy\n- Unacceptable or incompatible use\n- Existing scaffolding on site\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that the development would  have adverse impacts on the character and appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \n\nThe proposed extensions would be of an excessive depth at first floor to the rear and extend out the side boundary filling up the plot to the side and reducing the spaciousness between the adjacent plot. The proposals would not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and would not follow the guiding principles of the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide. \n\nIt is considerd that the proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring gardens and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would result in some loss of light and create a potential perceived loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers but neither are considered significant enough to merit a reason for refusal. The proposed extensions due to their proximity to the boundary and excessive depth would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and would narrow the outlook of neighbouring occupiers as a result to the detriment and harm of their existing living conditions. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be not in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\n\nGround Level / Base Level\nUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Please provide more details with regards to the proposed works. For example, please state in metres how much you propose to cut back for trees T.1, T.2 and T.3.",
    "Tree photos - Please email us clear photos of each tree and any key features you wish to draw to the attention of the Tree Officer to be considered in your application. Photos should be labelled T.1, T.2 and so on, in order that they can be identified according to the list of works you have provided and the corresponding numbered plan showing the location of each tree. This will enable the Council to provide you with a more prompt decision. \n"
