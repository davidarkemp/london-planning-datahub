    "The proposed development, by reason of its height, siting, massing and roof form, would create an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Derwent Road street scene and would also unduly reduce the characteristic gaps between dwellings on the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultants and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 3 (Materials) and Condition 25 (Details of Replacement Windows) of planning permission 22/02689/FUL, which state:\r\rCondition 3 (Materials) - Prior to construction works, the following details shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, implemented prior to occupation and thereafter permanently retained:\r\r(a)  materials for all external finishes, including brickwork and window frames (including their manufacturer's specification, colour and texture).\r\rReason: To ensure a good match with the existing London Stock brickwork and ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rCondition 25 (Details of Replacement Windows) - The existing, single-glazed windows are replaced with appropriate period/sash, Fensa approved, double glazed versions. Details of the replacement windows shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to commencement of the development, implemented prior to occupation and thereafter permanently retained.\r\rReason: In order to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "Your proposals are unclear because you have submitted different revisions of some plans, e.g. Drawing 1 and 1 Rev 4b, Drawing 2 and 2 Rev 4b. You have also submitted revisions of the same drawing number showing different plans, e.g. Drawing 7 shows Sections, and 7 Rev 4b shows Proposed Roof Plan.\r\rPlease can you submit a drawing schedule to clarify the submitted plans to be considered for this application?\rAlso please resubmit the final Existing and Proposed plans. Do not submit various revisions of the same plan."
