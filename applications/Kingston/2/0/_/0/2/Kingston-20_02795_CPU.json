    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions (incorporating a Juliet balcony) and installation of 2 no. rooflights to front roof slope, alterations to the soil and vent pipe falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received by neighbouring properties.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r- 22/00589/HOU - Erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Refused on 21.04.2022 for the following reason:\r\rThe siting, design and form of the proposed rear dormer extension would not relate well to the character and appearance of the host property and wider area and would appear as an incongruous addition. Thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted a proposal which would fall outside the guidance set out in Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD. Although the newly proposed dormer would still be visible from the streetscene, it would now maintain 500mm distance from the ridge, the sides and eaves proposed dormer complying with Residential Design SPD. Additionally, it would appear subordinate to the main dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.  It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy when compared to the existing situation.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
