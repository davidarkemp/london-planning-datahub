    "T.1 Oak - 3m Holistic crown reduction to suitable growth points & deadwood.\rT.2 Oak - 3-4m Holistic crown reduction & reshape to suitable growth points & deadwood.",
    "T.1 There has been no evidence submitted of the degree of decay associated with the Beef Steak Fungus, which is still a small fruiting body in one location and growing within minor bark wounds caused by the severing of ivy historically. The crown still appears healthy and is not showing signs of dieback that would be indicative of more advanced decay. On this basis the removal of the tree is excessive and should be downgraded to a reduction and ongoing annual autumnal monitoring to track the process and remove only when it becomes necessary.",
    "T.2 - A lateral reduction will result in an imbalance of the canopy and the owner of the tree has approached the Council to state they wish to reduce the remainder and will do so with the applicant at the same time using the same company for the work, as such the permission should allow a holistic reduction rather than a lateral reduction in isolation.",
    "Proposed development would require planning permission.",
    "If you have evidence to contradict the local planning authority's assessment of the application, you are encouraged to apply for the development again and include that evidence in support of the application.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
