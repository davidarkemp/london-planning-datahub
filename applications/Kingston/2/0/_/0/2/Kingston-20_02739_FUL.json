    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of planning permission ref: 20/01110/HOU dated 04.09.2020.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51\rof the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development to which this permission relates, including the foundation system shall be carried out in strict accordance with the Arboricultural Report submitted 19 Nov 2020, and under the supervision of the appointed Arboriculturalist and the approved tree protection measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.21 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two-storey rear extension would generally comply with the requirements set out in Policy Guidance 34, of the Residential Design SPD; it would relate well to the host property and would still not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed two-storey side extension would only maintain approximately 800mm from the shared boundary with neighbouring property No.255 Raeburn Avenue and it would not be set back by at least 500mm from the front of the house. However, the existing garage already sits where the proposed two-storey side extension would sit, therefore, it would not be significantly different from the existing situation, in regard to positioning. \r\rWhilst the proposed dormer would not be set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm or set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm, it would not feature on the front slope of the roof and this form of development would not be incongruous in the vicinity of Raeburn Avenue. Additionally, given that the dormer could be constructed under permitted development (even when including the roof of the two storey rear/side extension), officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 2.4m and a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.6m, falling in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Development of this type is prominent in the vicinity of Raeburn Avenue and the extension would not be seen from the streetscene.\r\rConsidering the above, on balance, the proposed development would be acceptable in the vicinity of Raeburn Avenue. Officers consider that the proposed extension would not significantly impact the area's character or appearance as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the development, using the BRE, 25 and 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed two-storey side extension would have a width of approximately 2.5m and only leave a gap of approximately 500mm from the shared boundary with No. 255 Raeburn Avenue. No.255 has 4 windows on the side elevation facing No. 257 which have been assessed in relation to impact on light and privacy. \r\rThe windows on the ground floor serve a playroom which would be impacted by the proposed development, however, the playroom is also served by a window to the front elevation, therefore, the proposed side extension would not cause significant harm to the ground-floor playroom. In regard to the window that serves a room on the first floor, officers acknowledge that the proposed side extension would impact the room in regard to loss of light, however, the existing window positioning on the first-floor level of both No.255 and No.257 breaches the BRE 25-Degree Rule. Additionally, the proposed side elevation windows would be positioned to slightly resemble No.255 windows on the first floor. Therefore, the would not be a significant loss of of light as a result of the two-storey side extension. In the event of an approval, officers consider that a condition to ensure that these windows are obscure glazed would be required, in the interest of protecting the privacy of neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would have a modest depth of approximately 2.4m and a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.6m. Officers have assessed the rear extension against neighbouring property No.259 Raeburn Avenue using the BRE 45 Degree Rule which demonstrates that there would not be significant harm in regard to loss of light to No.259.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property No.255 & No.259 Raeburn Avenue by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of sunlight or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 22/00841/HOU:\r- Changing the design of the approved single storey rear extension roof from pitched to flat.\r\rThe proposals would result in a decrease in the overall height, however, the height of the extension would increase in proximity to the neighbouring boundary due to an increased eaves height. The proposed changes and potential impact on neighbouring amenity and character and appearance are therefore considered not to be non-material.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the application be refused.",
