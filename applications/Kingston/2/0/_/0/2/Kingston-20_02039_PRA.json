    "It has not been demonstrated that the replacement of the existing extraction system would fall within the provisions of permitted development as granted under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The applicant has also failed to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that the replacement flue would not constitute building operations or other operations as defined within s55 1(A) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises of a detached dwelling.\r\r14 x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side and rear dormer roof extensions would not strictly adhere to the Council's residential SPD, however, the proposed development would fall within the provisions of permitted development. As permitted development rights exist for the dwelling, this is given significant weight in this matter. Therefore even though the design of the roof extensions is not ideal, due to the significant weight given to the fallback position, no objections are raised against the proposal on design grounds. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the nature of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. There are existing rear first floor windows to habitable rooms at the host property. The proposed rear dormers would not cause increased overlooking or loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, significant enough to warrant refusal. A condition making the proposed side dormers obscure glazed, could be added, if planning permission were to be approved.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which is considered to meet the requirements of the above mentioned policy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
