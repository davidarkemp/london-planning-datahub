    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their scale and siting, would appear disproportionate and unduly dominant. They would also erode the sense of balance with No.69 Windsor Avenue and close the separation gap to No. 73 Windsor Avenue, resulting in an incongruous appearance and causing the street to appear unduly enclosed, which would amount to unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed extensions, by reason of their scale and siting, would appear overbearing when viewed from No.73 Windsor Avenue and would cause the occupants of this property to feel unduly enclosed, resulting in unacceptable living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Other Side Elevation - Please provide Existing and Proposed Side Elevations showing the perspective from the other neighbour's side. Elevations must be at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. A scale bar is encouraged.\r",
