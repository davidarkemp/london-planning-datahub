    "Scale Bar Issues - the 1:50 scale bars on Plans A01 and A02 do not measure to the stated distance of 4m (they measure 2.6m), and the annotated dimensions are also incorrect. Please check the plan scales and amend where necessary.\r\rPlease note the requirements:\rExisting and Proposed Floor Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. A scale bar is encouraged.\rExisting and Proposed Elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. A scale bar is encouraged.\r\r"
