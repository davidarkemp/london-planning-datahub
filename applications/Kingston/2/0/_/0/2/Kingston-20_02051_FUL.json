    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous feature that would constitute a cramped form of development that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and have an appearance of being shoehorned onto the site, eroding the spaciousness of the donor plot and be out out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Knights Park/Fairfield Conservation Area the site sits within. Therefore the proposal does not accord with Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 196 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The general layout and positioning of fenestration is such that the future occupiers of the proposed development would be overlooked from the public realm of Grange Road and would have a limited and somewhat inadequate outlook from within the future property. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate in the absence of a supporting daylight/sunlight report/survey that the future occupants would have an adequate provision of daylight/sunlight. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development fails to provide adequate provision of private amenity space in accordance with the guidance set out in the Council's  adopted LDF Residential Design Guide 2013. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Residential Design Guide 2013.\r",
    "Condition 6 (Fire Safety Strategy) of planning permission 22/02673/FUL states:\r\rPrior to any above ground works (excluding demolition)  a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted Fire Statement dated 22nd March 2023 is considered to be sufficient. As such, the condition  6 (Fire Safety Strategy) is hereby approved. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Plan and thereafter maintained.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling. It is located in teh Richmond Road Conservation Area.\r\rConsultation\r\rOne objection received objecting on grounds of \r- Inappropriate design/layout\r - Noise\r - Privacy \r\rKTCAAC objection based on rooflights not being conservation type rooflights\r\rThe objections are addressed in the officers report. \r\rProposal \r\rAlterations to roof and installation of 5no. rooflights to facilitate loft conversion including internal alterations to first floor. Changes to fenestrations\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- Impact on Heritage assests; \r- Fire safety; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. Whilst the rooflights are not conservation style/type, they would not be highly visible in the street scene. Furthermore, it is considered that the conservation area is characterised by a mix of roof light types being 'conservation style' and non conservation style and that the roof lights as proposed are considered acceptable for the property and would result in an acceptable appearance on completion of the proposed development and allow for the overall character and appearance of the heritage asset the Richmond Road Conservation Area to be preserved and not cause harm to the designated heritage asset. As such it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Whilst objection has been raised in regards to privacy by the neighbouring occupiers it is considered that the inernal floor to ceiling heights in relation to the sill heights of the roof lights proposed is such that there would be no overlooking of neighbouring properties and the enlarged rear window would not materially worsen the existing relationship in respect of privacy bewteen the host poperty and the neighboruing properties. In addition, it is considered that the increase in openings would not give rise to adverse noise pollution. Roof lights are a common form of development in domestic settings. \r\rOther matters\r\rA condition is required to secure a fire strategy statement so as the development accords with policy D12 of the London Plan. \rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
