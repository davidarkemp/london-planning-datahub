    "The submitted details are unacceptable and show an inconsistent layout in comparison to that approved plans under planning permission 19/02940/FUL. The submitted details would not provide adequate cycle, refuse and recycling facilities in accordance with Policies D6 & T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The submitted details by the applicant are considered insufficient and therefore Condition 8 (Construction logistics plan) cannot be approved. The submitted details do not demonstrate how the the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and highway safety and the free flow of traffic would be safeguarded as requried by Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New\rDevelopments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The local planning authority must be satisfied that the amendment sought is non-material in order to grant an application under section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The Coombe Hill Conservation Area encompasses the estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course. The spacious landscaped setting contributes to the significance of the Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rErection of roof dormer to south elevations, together with installation of conservation rooflight.\r\rThis application follows previously refused application 23/02704/HOU dated 14.12.2023 for the removal of chimney stack and erection of dormer roof to existing loft extensions to east and south elevations and installation of 1no side rooflight.  which was refused for the following reason:\r\r1) The proposed development would diminish the architectural merit of the dwelling and would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2023).\r\rThis reason for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be approved.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rMalden And Coombe CAAC - Objection due to dormer and no heritage statement. Officers note that there is no requirement for a heritage statement to be submitted unless the property is a listed building. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the  Coombe Wood Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed chimney originally to be removed has now been retained. The proposed dormer would appear on the rear elevation and would be dressed with traditional lead work to compliment the existing property. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.   \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area. It therefore follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the Coombe Wood Conservation Area.\r\rThe reason for refusal has therefore been addressed.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
