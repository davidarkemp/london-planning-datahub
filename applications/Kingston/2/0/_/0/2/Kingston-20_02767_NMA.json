    "CONSULTATIONS\r3no. neighbours consulted. No representations received.\rRBK Highways Officer: No objection. \r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located in the southern side of Crescent Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance consisting of detached dwellinghouses. \r\rThe property is not listed and is not within a Conservation Area. The boundary of Liverpool Road Conservation Area ends on the northern side of Crescent Road. The site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rPROPOSAL\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a replacement front boundary wall. \rThe proposed boundary wall would have a height of 1.8m. \r \rASSESSMENT\rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the current Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. \r\rThe key planning considerations relevant in the assessment of this application are set out under the headings below:\r \rImpact on the Character and Appearance of the Site and Surrounding Area (including Impact upon Heritage Assets):\rNPPF attaches great importance to the design of the built environment. Paragraph 130 states that permission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area. Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rPolicy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (Including House Extensions) states that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements are identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced and includes the following:\r-\tPrevailing density of the surrounding area;\r-\tScale, layout, height, form (including roof forms), massing;\r-\tPlot width and format which includes spaces between buildings;\r-\tBuilding line build up, set back and front boundary; and\r-\tTypical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and the design detailing of elevation.\r\rAt paragraph 203 of the NPPF, the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy Guidance 44 (Walls and Enclosures) and Policy Guidance 45 (Front Gardens and Parking) of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013) are the most applicable to the proposal.\r\rWalls and enclosures are a characteristic feature of many of the Borough's streets across many of the common housing types. They provide a boundary to the curtilage of a property as well as providing some screening to safeguard privacy. \r\rCommon types of enclosures include walls, fences, gates and hedges. As such, walls and enclosures should be in keeping with the character of the street and surrounding area. The design, materials and height of walls and enclosures should relate well to other enclosures in the area.\r\rIt is noted that there are examples of brick walls on Crescent Road, so this feature has established as part of the local character. The proposed materiality choice for the front boundary wall would be 'Bexhill Ashdown' bricks, which would match the bricks used on the dwellinghouse. The height of the proposed boundary wall is considered to be excessive, with no other examples of brick boundary treatment as the boundary to the front of a property to such a height to this section of Crescent Road. \r\rAs such, the proposals by virtue of its height, would detract from the local character and setting of the adjacent Conservation Area, contrary to Paragraph 202 of the NPPF. The site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset, and the proposal is similarly considered to result in less than substantial harm to this non-designated heritage asset, contrary to Paragraph 203 of the NPPF.\r\rIt is considered that the proposals would not be a sufficiently subordinate addition, failing to comply with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012), Policy Guidance 44 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) and Paragraphs 202 and 203 of the NPPF (2023).\r\rImpact upon the Residential Amenities of the Neighbouring Occupiers:\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's LDD Core Strategy (2012) seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, daylight /sunlight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe nearest properties to consider in an assessment of the impact of the proposal are No. 44 and 48 Crescent Road, Kingston.\r\rThe proposed boundary treatments would be no greater than 1.8m in height to the side boundaries and as such are not considered to cause harm to neighbouring amenity. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant harm to the outlook, privacy or daylight/sunlight provision of all the neighbouring occupiers and would comply with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rHighways and Transportation:\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would not result in any difference to the on-site car parking arrangements in terms of either the number of on-site parking spaces, nor means of access/egress, utilising the existing crossover.\r\rThe Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer considered has no objection on this proposed development. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in severe harm to highway and pedestrian safety. Overall, the proposed entrance and crossover are compliant with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy.\r\r\rCONCLUSION / PLANNING BALANCE\rThe proposal is considered to be unacceptable in terms of its height and is as such considered to have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the surrounding area, including the setting of the adjacent boundary to the Liverpool Road Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character in which the site falls wtihin.\r\rRECOMMENDATION  \rRefuse planning permission.\r",
