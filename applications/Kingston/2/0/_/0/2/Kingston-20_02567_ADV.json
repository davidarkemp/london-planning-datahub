    "The application site is located on the pavement on Davis Road at the juncture with Cox Lane which cuts through the Chessington Industrial Area a designated Strategic Industrial Location.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly industrial. The site is not in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\rNo objections received. \r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the proposed installation of  a 20m high 5G telecoms: H3G street pole, additional equipment cabinets and associated works.\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location on the pavement on the corner of Davis Road at the juncture with Cox Lane .\r\rThe height of the mast would be 20 m which would be in excess of 10 to 12m higher than a standard street lamp column (10m) and  telegraph pole (8m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. In addition the proposed would be 6.5m taller than the immediate adjacent buildings. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not relate well to its surrounding and would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused. Whilst not necessary we used the following policies to assit with the assessment CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits. \r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",

    "The applicant is reminded that implementing the scheme subject of this application in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful. This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. The applicant is strongly advised to seek further advice before proceeding with any development.",
