    "Application Site\r\rThe site is a two-storey semi-detached dwelling. The site is located in a predominantly residential area and is within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area is as an area of individually designed detached and semi-detached houses dating from the 1850s set in a mature landscape on the edge of Richmond Park. The site is also not subject to any individual Tree Preservation Orders (TPO'S) but the trees would be protected under the Conservation Area protections.\r\rProposal\rErection of two-storey front and rear extensions and remodelling works to an existing dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r11 Neighbouring properties were initially notified and 3 letters of objection have been received from 2 addresses stating:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Terracing effect\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- The proposed front porch with Grecian doric columns is an architectural abomination with no reference to the Conservation Area\r\rFollowing the submission of amended plans another consultation letter was sent on 16/01/2024. One further representation was received from one of the previous objectors now offering support for the application following the amendments to the design.\r\rKingston CAAC - Objection -'Current property is a bit of an anomaly - part of front wing of original late Georgian/ early Victorian dwelling next door (#16) plus a poor quality 1969s/70s(?) infill brick built extension. Need for refurbishment is understood, but there are material issues with this significant project (representing a doubling of the existing living accommodation): \ri) new front porch is incongruous in scale/ design;\rii)new 2 storey front extension has rendered finish whereas rest of facade is brick; \riii) new fenestration at front is 4-pane in design which jars with the original 2-pane windows of its neighbour (#16); \riv) rear extension is very large in scale & encroaches significantly on the garden space (building line same as neighbours but they have larger gardens). All these concerns should be rectified by the applicant in order not to harm the character & appearance of the CA'\r\rIn order to address the comments raised by Kingston CAAC the applicant made the following amendments to the plans\r\r- The porch has been reduced in size and scale, to a simple, modest sized canopy, adding a layer and detail to the elevation, complementing the overall appearance of the building, in a way that is contextual, not incongruous. \r- The front extension is now also shown with a hipped roof, to better reflect 19th century villa precedents and reducing the bulk of the extension.                   \r- Enhancing the landscaping of the front garden to increase the extent of greenery and contribution to the conservation area. \r\rA second round of consultations have been sent and no further response has been received from Kingston CAAC concerning this application.\r\rRBK Tree Officer - No objection subject to a planning condition requiring replacement trees.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact on trees; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the original property has been extended to the front and side with a two-storey flat roof extension and a single storey front and side extension. The extensions do not relate particularly well to the character and appearance of the original dwelling or the wider area and the existing dwelling is therefore somewhat anomalous.\r\rWithin this context, it is considered that elements of the proposed two-storey front extension, such as the incorporation of a hipped roof, would improve the character and appearance of the dwelling within the street scene. While render is not characteristic to No. 18A (which is painted brick), it is a material used in the construction of properties in the vicinity and would therefore not appear incongruous which addresses comments made by CAAC in relation to the use of render.  When compared to the existing extensions it is considered that the proposed two-storey front and rear extension would be acceptable from a character and appearance perspective.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would have a more contemporary appearance which would not be highly visible within the street scene. It is considered to be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the dwelling.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 195 to 214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As has been set out above it is considered that the proposed development, when compared to the existing extensions to the property, would be acceptable from a character and appearance perspective.\r\rIn R (Hughes) v South Lakeland District Council (2014) EWHC 3979 (Admin) it was established that in the context of the statutory duty under Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 that 'preserve' means to do no greater harm than the existing situation.\r\rIt is noted that the special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: 'An area of individually designed detached and semi-detached houses dating from the 1850s set in a mature landscape on the edge of Richmond Park.'. The existing flat roof extensions which incorporate concrete hanging tile on the first floor side elevation do not relate well to the existing dwelling or vernacular of the wider Conservation Area.\r\rThe two-storey front extension would appear more prominent within the street scene and would not be seen in the wider area. However, the incorporation of a hipped roof and the removal of the concrete hanging tiles would be a marked improvement in terms of materiality. As a pair, Nos. 18 and 18A do not share much symmetry and are of an irregular appearance.\r\rOverall, considering the Lakeland judgement it is considered that the proposed development would, on balance, cause no greater harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area when compared to the development which it would replace. It is therefore considered that the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. It therefore follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the Conservation Area for the purposes of paragraphs 205 - 209 of the NPPF (2023).\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Comments received from neighbouring properties have been considered and it is noted that following the submission of amended plans and design one objection has been removed regarding loss of light. An  objection in relation to the location of a wall/fence has been addressed by the applicant and moved in order to satisfy a concern that was raised previously. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rThe Council encourages the planting of native species. Where new tree species are to be introduced, a preference will be given to native species, where these native species represent the dominant character of the landscape (e.g. in proximity to a woodland setting) or disease/pollution resistant species, where proposed in close proximity to motorised traffic.\r\rThe Council discourages the planting of invasive or aggressive species, particularly where these species are proposed to be planted in close proximity to a neighbour's wall, fence or other structure. Large-canopied species are also discouraged.\r\rDue to the loss of a tree in a Conservation area two replacement trees will be required and this will be secure by condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
