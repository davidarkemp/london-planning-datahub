    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and fenestration alteration.\r\rConsultations\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC) - No Objection \r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received by neighbouring properties relating to:\r\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rAll concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 4m and a parapet roof height of approximately 3.5m falling outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD. However, the depth is considered to be acceptable within the context of neighbouring extensions.\r\rIt is noted that the proposed development would have an external finish of pale brick cladding, this would not be considered acceptable as the site is within the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area and the external materials of the application and neighbouring dwellings comprise yellow and red London stock brick. The similar design and materials used in the Balaclava Road villas are considered to contribute to the significance of the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area. It is unclear whether a brick cladding product would provide a high quality finish.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed materials would fail to respect the character and appearance of the exsiting dwelling or the wider area. It is not considered that this could be addressed by way of a planning condition as a change in the proposed materials could require alterations to the design of the extension.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 34 Balaclava Road, as they benefit from an existing single storey rear extension, the extension would only extend past No.34's extension by approximately 1m and it would have a separation distance of approximately 1m.\r\rOfficers note that there are 3 windows on the side elevation of No.38 facing towards the application site (as shown on the submitted drawings for planning application ref: 23/01095/FUL). The window closest to the proposed rear extension serves a bathroom/toilet which is not a habitable room, however, the window further away from the proposed extension appears to serve a bedroom, a habitable room. The window in question is sited such that it faces onto the side passages between the properties and the bulk of the existing dwelling at No. 36. It is noted that the existing dwelling, No. 36, subtends a 25 degree angle when drawn from the affected side window indicating that the diffuse daylighting for the affected room is already adversely affected. Within the context of the existing built form and that the proposed single storey rear extension would be set-in from the side elevation of No. 38 by approximately 1.7m, it is not considered that the proposed development would have a materially significant adverse impact on the amenities of the ground floor flat at No. 38 when compared to the existing situation.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of daylight or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: An area of several cohesive groups of two storey red brick houses built between 1893 and 1904. It is noted that the properties fronting Balaclava Road were erected by Charles Adams, who was responsible for erecting all 17 of the villas, and that these dwellings are of the same design.\r\rAs previously mentioned, the proposed development would not be in general keeping with host property, as it would not maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area by proposing pale brick cladding. Officers concluded that the proposed development would result in less than substabtial harm to the significance of the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area and that it would fail to preserve its significance.\r\rIn accordance with paragraph 202 of the NPPF (2023), any less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal.  The submitted Planning, Heritage, Design and Access Statement states that the proposals would: '...preserve and enhance the appearance of the building whilst improving the housing stock of Wandsworth by providing an improved family unit.'\r\rThe improved standard of accommodation would be a private benefit of the scheme for the occupants. As is noted above, the proposed extension is considered to cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Conservation Area. As such, it is not considered that there would be any public benefits of the scheme which would outweigh the identified harm.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
