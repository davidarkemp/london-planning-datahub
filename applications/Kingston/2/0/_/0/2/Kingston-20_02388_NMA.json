    "Condition 14 of planning permission 19/01228/FUL is replaced with: \r\rThe commercial units hereby approved shall not be used for the preparation or sale of hot food (whether for consumption on or off the premises) until details of a scheme for the ventilation of the unit to an appropriate outlet level has been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The details shall include sound attenuation measures for any necessary plant, odour mitigation measures and a timetable for provision. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details and timetable and thereafter retained. \r\rReason:To safeguard the amenity of existing and future occupants in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy (April 2012).\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemoition of existing garage and erection of single-storey side/rear extension\r\rThis application follows a recently permitted application 22/02933/HOU dated 08.11.2022 for the erection of single storey side extension. \r\rIt is also noted that a similar permission is currently under construction at adjacent site No. 21 Kneller Road.\r\rConsultation\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:Policy Guidance 35 (Single Storey Side Extensions) states that the following guidance should be followed when designing a single storey rear extension:\r- The roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form, and the height of the roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the second storey.\r- The extension should remain proportionate and subordinate to the original house, so that in general, the width of the extension does not exceed 50% of that of the original house.\r- Side extensions should normally be set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm.\r- Features such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house.\r- Side extensions to semi-detached dwellings should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property.\r\rThe proposed side extension has been set back from the front wall. Officers note that the proposed flat roof element would not be in compliance with policy guidance 35, however, overall it would be a sympathetic addition to the host property.  It is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 17 and No. 21 Kneller Road. Due to the location of the proposed development it is unlikely to cause any harm to No. 17 Kneller Road. With regards to No. 21, officer not there are not proposed windows to flank elevation facing towards No. 21. It is also noted that No. 21 is currently constructing a similar extension. Officers therefore consider that due to its limited height, the proposed development will not cause loss of light or privacy. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rHighways - The proposed development would remove access to the garage area, an area that current provides access to cycle parking. It is therefore reasonable to impose a condition requiring replacement cycle parking to be provided. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The amended Site Location Plan on the Creative Living plan still does not include land necessary to carry out the proposed development, i.e. the red line does not include land up to the front pavement. You have shown this red line on the separately submitted Site Location Plan that you produced on the 'UK Map Centre' website. We note that the other flats own the frontage, but you state in your Application Form that you have informed them of the planning application.\r\rThe fact that you have submitted two Site Location Plans with different red line site boundaries is also an issue as they must be consistent.\r\rNote: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red and any other land owned by the applicant in blue. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development, e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, car parking and open areas around buildings.\r\rPlease amend the Site Location Plan(s) to meet the above requirements.\r"
