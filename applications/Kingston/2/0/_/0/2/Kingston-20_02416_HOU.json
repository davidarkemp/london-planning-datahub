    "The proposed hardstanding would have an unnacceptable adverse impact on congestion and highway safety as it would require vehicles to traverse an existing traffic calming measure and it would require an amendment of a Traffic Management Order to necessitate the removal/reduction of an existing controlled parking zone (CPZ) on-street parking bay, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 104 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), as well as Core Strategy Policy DM9 and Policy DM10 of the Councils LDF Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Insufficicent information has been provided to indicate that the proposed soakaway and associated drainage would not pose signficant harm to the TPO tree located at the front of No. 25 Alexandra Road. Furthermore, the manner in which the paviours are to be installed, along with associated excavation depth to match with crossover is of great concern as is the potential for harm via compaction of the sub base, both of which could harm the roots of the TPO tree, thereby conflicting with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the Councils LDF Core Strategy (2012)."
