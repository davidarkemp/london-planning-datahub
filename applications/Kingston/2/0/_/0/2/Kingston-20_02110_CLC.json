    "In the absence of sufficient information, the application fails to comply with the requirements of Condition 18 (Remediation Works Verification Report )of application ref no 18/10299/FUL. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy DM8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. Under Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rOn 12 February 2013, the Council granted planning permission for: \"Refurbishment and extensions of existing retail store (Primark Nos 70-76) to provide a four storey retail building, with basement and roof level plant, including the demolition and redevelopment of 78 Eden Street (Friends Meeting House)\". \r\rThe planning permission is subject to Minor Material Amendments ('MMA') relative to Condition 2 (Approved Drawings) and Condition 8 (Windows) approved on 13 July 2016 and 12 February 2019 (refs: 16/12351/FUL and 18/12568/FUL). Primark has been operating from the site under these consents. \r\rCondition 11 of the original Planning Permission (ref: 12/12754/FUL) (which is repeated in Conditions 11 and 8 of the subsequent MMA approvals) requires the following: \"Deliveries to the site and servicing shall only take place between 7am and 8pm Mondays to Saturdays. There shall be no deliveries or servicing on Sundays and Bank Holidays.\" This year there are two substitute Bank Holidays for Christmas Day and New Year's Day this year. The applicant advises that as with last December, it is necessary for Primark to undertake deliveries on Bank Holidays over the Christmas and New Year period in order to ensure that supplies within the shop are not significantly affected during the post-Christmas peak shopping season.  Accordingly, this application seeks an amendment to Condition 11 in order to lift the restrictions on the deliveries on 26th and 27th December 2022 and 2 January 2023. \r\r A similar relaxation was granted in December 2021 reference  21/03818/NMA  and also  in  June 2022 relating to additional Bank Holidays in June 2022 (22/01629/NMA). \r\rAs the relaxation of the delivery restrictions relates to only the specific days, it is considered that the amendment is non-material to the consented scheme and therefore would be appropriate to formalise it by way of non-material amendments to Condition 11, as follows:\r\rDeliveries to the site and servicing shall only take place between 7am and 8pm Mondays to Saturdays. There shall be no deliveries or servicing on Sundays and Bank Holidays, with the exception of  26th and 27th December 2022 and 2 January 2023 (between 7am and 8am).\"\r\r Officers conclude that the proposed amendment would be non-material.\r",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Side Elevations to the proposed projrcting sign at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
