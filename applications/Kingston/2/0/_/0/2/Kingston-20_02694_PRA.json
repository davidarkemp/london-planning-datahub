    "No demolition or development, other than demolition to top of slab level, shall take place until a stage 1 written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, and the programme and methodology of site evaluation and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.\r\rIf heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 then for those  parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be  submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that  is included within the stage 2 WSI, no demolition/development shall take place  other than in accordance with the agreed stage 2 WSI which shall include: \rA. The statement of significance and research objectives, the  \rprogramme and methodology of site investigation and recording and  the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake  the agreed works \rB. Where appropriate, details of a programme for delivering related  positive public benefits. \rC. The programme for post-investigation assessment and  \rsubsequent analysis, publication & dissemination and deposition of  resulting material. this part of the condition shall not be discharged  until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the  \rprogramme set out in the stage 2 WSI. \r\rReason: This pre-commencement condition is necessary to safeguard the archaeological  interest on this site. Approval of the WSI before works begin on site provides  clarity on what investigations are required, and their timing in relation to the  development programme. If the applicant does not agree to this pre commencement condition please let us know their reasons and any alternatives  suggested. Without this pre-commencement condition being imposed the  application should be refused as it would not comply with NPPF paragraph 199.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises commercial property on the corner of High Street and Kings Avenue, New Malden. The ground floor is currently Class 2 Bank with the upper floors residential.\r\rProposal\rRemoval of existing signage and 1no. ATM and infill with material to match the existing elevation. \r\rThe existing bank branch is no longer operating from this unit so signage and ATM are no longer required.\r\rConsultation\r28 surrounding properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes matching materials and should permission be granted a condition requiring this would be applied. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Other Side Elevation - Please provide Existing and Proposed Side Elevations showing the perspective from the adjoining neighbour's side. Elevations must be at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. A scale bar is encouraged.\r"
