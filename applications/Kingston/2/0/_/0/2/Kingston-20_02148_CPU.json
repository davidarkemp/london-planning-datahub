    "The proposed erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site is located on the pavement on the west side of King Charles Road outside the King Charles Centre and south of the junctions with Alexandra Drive and Hollyfield Road. \r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in character and appearance. The site is located opposite the designated Alexandra Recreation Ground Metropolitan Open Land and sits just to the south of the designated heritage asset the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. The immediate surrounding buildings and curtilage/land are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\r130 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposed telecoms apparatus.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of H3G 15m street pole and additional equipment cabinets.\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed having regard to Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) 1990 Act, the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies. \r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location on the pavement on the west side of King Charles Road outside the King Charles Centre and south of the junctions with Alexandra Drive and Hollyfield Road and opposite and in close proximiy to a number of residential properties and adjacent the designated well used Alexandra  Recreation Ground Metropolitan Open Land and Fishponds Park Conservation Area.\r\rThe height of the mast would be 15m which would be in excess of 5 to 7m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed telecoms equipment would be sited adjacent to the designated heritage asset of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would provide the benefit of an improved telecoms offer in the area this benefit does not outweigh the disbenefit of the less than substantial harm caused by the proposal in its failure to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the setting of the conservation area. \r\rThe proposed telecoms equipment would also be located opposite the designated Alexandra  Recreation Ground Metropolitan Open Land and the siting and appearance of the proposal would detract from its setting. \r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance of the telecoms apparatus would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with paragraphs 194 - 209 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits. \r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.\r\rIt should be noted that contrary to the inference made by the applicants in their supporting documentation the applicant did not engage in  pre-application correspondence or discussions either with the LPA or the future education provider on the site of the King Charles Centre.",
