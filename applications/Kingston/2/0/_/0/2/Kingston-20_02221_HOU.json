    "The proposed extension by reason of its excessive depth and width, leaving no separation distance from the shared boundaries, would result in an unacceptable loss of light and an undue sense of enclosure and loss of outlook in relation to the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 19 Queens Road, thereby conflicting with Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant is advised to submit a householder planning application for the proposed works.",
    "I acknowledge receipt of your payment for £4,624, the fee required for this application is £7,514, therefore please forward the outstanding balance of £2,890 as soon as possible. This is based on the information supplied in the cover letter - the 8 dwellings and 329sqm of commercial floor space.\r\rNote: Payment can be made online via the Kingston council website, via our Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002, or by cheque made payable to Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames"
