    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38 (6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004  states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate  otherwise. \r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rThe application site resides within Flood Zone 2\r\rProposal \rThe  current planning application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established. On such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary  and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application. In assessing the application, Officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since granting the original permission. \r\rPermission was granted under  24/01684/HOU dated  16 September 2024 for the Demolition of conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension. \r\rAs noted before the principle of development has already been established as this application  seeks  amendments to the following:\r- Retention of rear (now built) extension wall (and foundations) to 3650mm from the house wall \r- Increase height rear extension \r- Change of colour of the sliding doors to black - \r- Installation of 400 x 500 H window in the ground floor toilet \r- Raise height of front rooflight ( Repositioned higher on roof slope)\r- Removal small window from first floor bathroom \r- Install 600 x 900 rooflight on loft  roof  \r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety Strategy\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment :\rOfficers have reviewed and assessed the proposed amendments to the development in the context of the previous planning  permission ( ref : 24/01684/HOU). It is noted from the  submission that works have commenced on site.  \r\rOverall,  the  proposed development is  considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its siting in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely  affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPD.\r\rOfficer Comment : The application is accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment which identifies the site falling within Flood Risk Zone 2. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is not lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rThe submitted Flood Risk Assessment which accompanied  planning permission (ref : 24/01684/HOU) appears to have been produced in accordance with the Environment Agency standing advice. A revised Flood Risk Assessment  was not submitted to accompany this application  and on that basis Officers consider there to be no change to the scope nor principle of the original document to impact upon the decision of this application.   In the event of an approval, Officers would consider it appropriate to impose a planning condition requesting that ground floor power sockets be located a minimum of 450mm above FFL (700mm above the maximum flood level) in order to provide an additional safety measure.\r\rFire safety  \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has  not resubmitted a Reasonable Exception Statement to support this application.   On this basis, the previously approved Reasonable Exception Statement remains extant  in the context of this decision. Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r\r",

    "Application Site\rThe application property is a large detached house with a spacious plot in an area comprised detached properties on the west side of Stoke Road and is located within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: The estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course.   \r\rThe existing property is not listed, however, the site is also located within the Strategic Area of Special Character (Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill) and is located adjacent to an area of land designated as an Area of Archaeological Significance and Metropolitan Open Land (MOL). \r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey rear extension, replacement of existing timber windows into French painted timber doors to rear garden, replacement of existing French door to front elevation and porthole window with new timber French door with fanlight. Addition of new window from kitchenette to side elevation and new access door into existing garage.\r\rConsultation\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rMalden and Coombe Neighbourhood CAAC: No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alteration to the front elevation would be in keeping with the property and would not result in harm to the character or appearance of the area. The proposed rear extension would not be viewable within the streetscene. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 205-214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the The Coombe Hill Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling within the 2.5 Coombe Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r32 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rRelevant Planning History \r- 24/03065/NMA - Non Material Amendment to planning permission 23/01842/HOU (Erection of side extension at first and second floor) to amend roof design including additional skylight and changes to rear dormers. Refused on 10.01.2025.\r- 23/01842/HOU - Erection of side extension at first and second floor. Granted on 01.09.2025\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.- The impact of the development on non-designated & designated heritage assets.  \r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rDesign\rOfficer Comment: The application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 23/01842/HOU:\r\r-  Alteration of the dormer windows to have flat roofs instead of pitched and;\r- Incorporating a uniform roof line instead of different ridge heights.\r\r The applicant previously submitted a non-material amendment application for the above changes which was ultimately refused as the proposal as a whole would fall outside the realm of non-material. In particular, the changes to the initially approved development would've caused a substantial change to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area. \r\rOfficers have now assessed the changes to the roof and concluded that whilst this change would be visible in the streetscene, it would not cause detrimental harm to the vicinity. The rest of the proposed development still remains as follows:\r\rOfficers note that the proposed first floor extension would not adhere to the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 37 on Cat-Slide Roofs, in regards to maintaining the set back from the front building line (in this case, the start of cat slide feature) by a minimum of 1m to retain the form. However, officers acknowledge that the vicinity of Wolsey Close has a variation of dwelling styles, therefore, the proposal would not be an odd addition. \r\rThe proposed side extension would have a set down from the ridge line of approximately 400mm, maintain distance from the front of approximately 1.2m and maintain the existing distance of approximately 1m distance from the boundary shared between 3 Wolsey Close, falling in line with Policy Guidance 36, of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rTherefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above, officers consider that the proposed development would not cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of Wolsey Close or the host building. As such, the proposed development would not harm the 2.5 Coombe Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies a similar footprint to the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Officer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of garage into a habitable room and erection of a single storey front extension to include front porch extension. Changes to fenestrations. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the conversion of the garage to a habitable room and erection of single storey front extension to include front porch extension. Changes to fenestration.  \r\rOfficers note there are various styles of porches and garage conversions within the streetscene. Whilst the proposed front extension projection would exceed the existing front building line of dwelling and neighbouring dwellings, Officers note a similar built form at no 31 The Byeways. For this reason, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rDespite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. Officers note there is no access to the rear garden and the loss of the garage also results in the loss of possible cycle storage. Should permission be granted a condition requiring details of future cycle parking would be applied.\r\rThe application involves the loss of  the garage space. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety. Therefore, the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. \r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\rFire safety \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of piggyback roof extension raising part of roof height. Removal of 2 chimneys and installation of 4nos rooflights . Fenestration alteration in the first floor.  \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises  a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r02/12394/FUL - Erection of first floor rear extension and roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Refused 03.12.02\r02/12103/FUL - Erection of first floor rear extension and roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Refused 29.08.02\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a piggyback roof extension,raising part of roof height. Removal of 2 chimneys and installation of 4 nos rooflights. Fenestration alteration in the first floor. \r\rOfficers note the proposed single story piggyback gable loft extension above the main volume of the house would be set back by 4m (wall to wall measurement) and therefore would be compliant with Policy Guidance 40 in the Residential Design SPD.The proposed piggyback roof extension would accommodate 4no rooflights\r\rThe proposed fenestration alterations  on  both proposed west and east side elevations as well as the  proposed rear elevation are deemed acceptable. Should Officers be mindful to approve the planning application, appropriate planning conditions will be appended to the decision  requesting  identified windows to be obscure glazed and removing permitted development rights for the installation of additional windows on the west and east elevations of the  dwelling.   \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the  piggyback roof extension, raising part of roof height together with the removal of 2no chimneys ad installation of 4 nos rooflights and fenestration alterations in the first floor, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rOfficers note the existing upper level  side elevation windows on the neighbouring dwellings serve non habitable rooms.\r\rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a  Reasonable Exception Statement,.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Application Site: \r\rThe application relates to a site to the north of East Road behind James House which fronts Richmonds Road. The site is currently a private 15-space carpark that serves James House. James House is currently a 3-storey property with a ground floor retail unit, occupied by Richer Sounds, and 2 floors of residential units above, comprising 10 flats.  The third floor (fourth storey) is currently under construction and will comprise 3 flats as granted under planning permission reference 20/01196/FUL. \r\rThe site is within Kingston Town Centre with Richmond Road being within a shopping frontage and predominated by ground floor retail and commercial units with residential flats above. East Road is characterised by mostly residential properties of differing typologies. \r\rRichmond Road (A307) is a major arterial road within TfL's road network. The site has a PTAL rating of 6a on a scale of 0-6b with 6b being the most accessible, meaning it has very high public transport accessibility. The site is located within a controlled parking zone (CPZ).\r\rThe site is not located within a conservation area nor is it a statutory listed building and non-designated heritage asset. No. 74 to 84 Richmond Road are buildings of townscape merit. \r\rThe site is within Flood Zone 1 and has a low probability of flooding from rivers and the sea. The site is not within a Critical Drainage Area. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is for the erection of a two-bedroom dwelling in the car park and amendments to the layout of the existing car park. \r\rRelevant History: \r\r20/01196/FUL: Erection of roof extension to create 3no.x new dwellings, with associated parking, landscaping alterations and associated development works. Granted 21.12.2020. \r\r16/12266/FUL: Erection of a 3 bedroom dwelling. Granted 01.06.2016. \r\r95/3335/FUL: Change of use of first floor and second floors from offices to use as 10 separate flats. Granted 16.11.1995. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 49 neighbours were consulted and 5 objections were received. These are summarised below. \r\r- Loss of daylight and sunlight for neighbouring occupants\r- Loss of privacy from balconies and flank windows\r- Too many car parking spaces resulting in insufficient vehicle turning around within carpark layout\r- Contrary to sustainable transport objectives and increased parking stress\r- Loss of landscaping and trees\r- No consideration of resurfacing of the car park, cycle and waste storage and new security gates consented under the approved scheme 20/01196/FUL\r- Disruption and disturbance as a result of construction works\r\rConsultee Comments: \r\rCouncil's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer raised no objection to the proposal, subject to the securing final details via conditions and a legal agreement. \r\rCouncil's Environmental Health Officer raised no objection to the proposal. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Principle of Development \r- Standard of Accommodation\r- Character and Design \r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Highways and Transportation\r- Climate Change and Sustainability\r- Fire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development: \r\rThe Policy GG2 of the London Plan (2021) (LP) and Paragraph 124 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) (NPPF) promote the redevelopment of underutilised land for the delivery of housing. Policy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) (CS) sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the LP. LP Policy H1 sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10-year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThe Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply of housing land as required by the NPPF therefore, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In other words, the tilted balance weighs a development's adverse impacts against its benefits, not on a level playing field, but tilted towards granting permission. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application. \r\rThe proposal is for a new dwelling within the car park which would reduce the number of spaces from 15 to 10. The allocated spaces to leaseholders from James House would be retained which is supported. The Ground Floor Plan approved for the most recent planning permission 20/01196/FUL identifies a refuse and cycle storage area for the commercial unit along the northern side boundary of the carpark, adjacent to the carpark, as well as a new automated gate at the entrance. These details have not been identified on any of the submitted plans and Officers are unable to determine if the proposed car park layout would successfully allow these features to be provided. Additional material submitted during the assessment of the application confirms further consultation is required between the Applicant's Transport Consultant and the commercial occupier, Richer Sounds, in regard to their cycle and waste storage provision to determine whether it can be accommodated within the car park layout. There are a number of unresolved matters with the scheme and a lack of insufficient information to adequately assess whether the proposed car park arrangement would be provided without compromising neighbouring amenity and vehicle movement along the highway. This carries weight against the scheme. \r\rThe proposal would make a small but positive contribution to Council's housing target, in line with LP Policy H1 and CS Policy CS10. Support for the principle of development is subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. LP Policy D6 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall GIA, built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. CS Policy DM13 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rThe proposal would deliver a 2-bedroom, 3-person dwellinghouse. The overall gross internal floor (GIA) area would be 89.9 sqm. The dwelling would meet the minimum internal space standards, in terms of GIA, bedroom sizes and storage space, in compliance with LP Policy D6. The proposed Section Plans confirm the dwelling would achieve a minimum 2.5m floor-to-ceiling height for at least 75% of the GIA, in compliance with LP Policy D6. \r\rThe dwelling would be dual aspect and each habitable room would be serviced by at least one window for suitable ventilation, outlook and access to natural light in compliance with LP Policy D6. \r\rThe dwelling would have a 39.2 sqm rear garden, 18.6 sqm front garden and 5.9 sqm balcony. The private outdoor amenity space complies with CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 13 in the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (SPD). \r\rThe proposal would achieve compliance with Building Regulation requirements M4(2) for adaptable and accessible homes in terms of step free access and internal layout, in compliance with LP Policy D7. \r\rIn summary, the proposed units would achieve an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants, in compliance with LP Policy D6 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rCharacter and Design. \r\rPara 131 of the NPPF states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. \r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. CS Policy CS8 and DM10 and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide SPD require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rKingston's Residential Design SPD, the Small Sites Design Narrative 2024) and London Plan Guidance for Small Site Design Codes 2023 provide guidance for residential development on small sites. \r\rThe Kingston Borough Character Study 2011 for Canbury recognises the area as an inner Victorian suburban area of established high quality. The property would be highly visible to surrounding properties, including from the Kingston Town Centre at Richmond Road. The proposal is for a 2-storey, with roof space, street-facing infill dwellinghouse which would continue the terrace of housing along East Road. The dwellinghouse would be on a 113 sqm plot and have a plot coverage of 32%. The proposal seeks a traditional form with a pitched roof to be in keeping with the prevailing character of the built form. Officers consider the site is capable of subdivision and would be in keeping with the density of the local area, in compliance with Policy Guidance 4 and 25 of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe development would be built right to the north-eastern boundary, setback a minimum of 2.9m from the rear boundary and setback 13m from James House. The proposed front boundary would respect the pre-established building line along the street with space for a front garden in compliance with Policy Guidance 23 of the Residential Design SPD. The property would introduce a 2-storey blank wall right up to the shared boundary with no. 1 East Road. Officers consider the siting of the development to be poor and would present as an overly dominant building that is unneighbourly, contrary to LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rThe proposal includes a rear balcony on the second floor level with a 1.1m high balustrade along the rear boundary.  The Applicant has claimed the rear balcony is comparable to the juliet balcony on the second floor level of no. 1 East Road approved under planning permission reference 20/02312/HOU. While there are examples of juliet balconies at the two-storey level in properties fronting East Road, there are no examples of rear balconies which are more detrimental in terms of impact on neighbouring amenity. The balcony would be set up 0.9m from the roof eaves and 0.4m from the side of the roof closest to no. 1 East Road and therefore, would not be highly visible within the roof slope and is therefore, supported on design grounds. \r\rThe proposal would include a large metal standing seam front dormer that is 2.3m high, 3.1m wide and 2.5m deep. The submitted Proposed East Side Elevation demonstrates the front dormer would be partially blocked by the front dormer on. 1 East Road however, it would be highly visible from the west when looking at the site from Richmond Road. The front dormer would only be set up from the roof eaves by 0.4m. Additionally, it would include a front window that would not align with the windows on the elevations below, unlike the front dormers on no. 1 and 3 East Road. Officers consider the siting and size of the front dormer to be insensitive to the proportions of the dwellinghouse and would be an incongruous feature within the streetscape, contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe dwellinghouses would be a contemporary approach to traditional building materials, including light coloured facing brickwork, slate tiled roof, zinc clad dormer, and light coloured aluminium window frames. Officers consider the materials to generally be generally acceptable and complement the traditional materials and detailing of the surrounding built form. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, final material details would be secured by condition to ensure high quality products are proposed from design to construction stage. \r\rOfficers consider the siting of the proposed dwellinghouse to be uneighbourly and result in an overly dominant development right on the shared property boundary, contrary to LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. Additionally, the front dormer would be an incongruous feature within the host property and the streetscape due to its poor siting and design, contrary to LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 39 under the Residential Design SPD. This carries weight against the scheme. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity: \r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. CS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal has the potential to impact neighbouring properties at no. 1 East Road to the west, no. 6 Gibbon Mews to the rear and James House to the east. \r\rIn terms of privacy, the proposed scheme would not include flank windows facing no. 1 East Road which is supported to prevent overlooking opportunities. The flank window on the western elevation would be obscurely glazed to mitigate overlooking. The proposed rear balcony would be set nearly 1m behind the juliet balcony on no. 1 and would include a 1.1m high balustrade which would overcome any loss of privacy on neighbours. The Applicant has submitted a visual of the proposed outlook from the balcony window and this confirms loss of privacy on neighbours would be negligible. A rear window is proposed on the first floor however, it is located on the western side of the property, setback from the shared boundary to avoid overlooking and rear windows at the ground floor are screened by a high brick wall on the shared boundary which would prevent overlooking between the rear garden and neighbouring properties. \r\rIn terms of overshadowing, a Daylight, Sunlight and Overshadowing Report (prepared by Pro Sustainability, dated October 2024) has been submitted. The report states the proposal would result in a negligible impact on neighbouring habitable windows, in terms of daylight distribution (DD) and vertical sky component (VSC). Additionally, the proposal would not result in an unacceptable level of overshadowing on the outdoor amenity spaces of neighbouring properties. The proposal would result in a reduction in annual probable sunlight hours (APSH) for 3 windows tested (facades within 90 degrees of due south). The 3 windows are roof lights, 2 of which serve a kitchen in no. 1 East Road and 1 that serves a bedroom in no. 6 Gibbon Mews were shown as resulting in a medium level of reduction in sunlight at a 51%, 34% and 35% reduction in APSH respectively (sunlight availability is affected if the centre of the window receives less than 25% APSH). The report states that BRE recommendations consider these impacted windows as being less important due to their use (kitchen and bedrooms) however, BRE guidelines emphasises that 'care should be taken not to block too much sun.' The worst affected window would experience a 51% reduction in ASPH which Officers consider would significantly affect occupants in no. 1 East Road's access to sunlight in their kitchen/dining room, especially as the only other windows serving this room are north facing. A number of objections have been received from neighbours which raise overshadowing and loss of daylight as a concern. \r\rThe new dwelling on the site would increase comings and goings within the property but Officers do consider the levels would be beyond an acceptable level within the sustainable residential setting. \r\rAn air source heat pump (ASHP) would be located at the roof level. Officers consider sufficient space would be available to ensure it would be appropriately concerned by the roof form. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, a condition would have been secured to place noise limits on the ASHP. \r\rIn summary, the proposal, due to its poor siting and mass along the shared boundaries would result in an unacceptable level of overshadowing and loss of daylight for neighbouring occupants, contrary to LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. This carries weight against the scheme. \r\rHighways and Transportation:\r\rPara 116 states development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network, following mitigation, would be severe, taking into account all reasonable future scenarios. CS Policy CS7 and DM10 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe site has a PTAL 6a rating. The dwellinghouse would be car-free development which is supported by Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer as it complies with LP Policy T6. The site is within a CPZ therefore, if the scheme was considered acceptable, car-free development would have been secured by legal agreement. \r\rThe proposed reduction in car parking numbers within the existing car park is considered to be acceptable as it would provide for the leaseholders of James House approved under planning permission 95/3335/FUL. Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has raised no concerns about the swept path analysis which indicates that cars can safely enter and exit the car parking spaces in a forward gear. \r\rA total of 1 electric vehicle charging station would be included within the car park which is slightly below the 20% requirement under LP Policy T6.1C. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, final EV charging facilities would have been secured by condition. \r\rA cycle storage area for 2 bikes is provided in the rear garden of the dwellinghouse which is accessible from a gate adjacent to the car turning area. The quantum is compliant with LP Policy T5, CS Policy CS6 and DM8.  Final details of the cycle store would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable to ensure it is accessible, weatherproof and secure in line with the London Cycle Design Standards. \r\rRefuse storage would be located adjacent to the cycle storage with allowance for 4 bins and a food bin according to the Design and Access Statement. The quantum of bins and the storage area generally complies with Appendix 2 of the Residential Design SPD. Final details would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. Refuse would be collected from the kerbside along East Road as per the existing condition. \r\rA Construction Management Plan would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable to ensure construction vehicles and associated works do not impact the local highway network.  \r\rThe proposed development would not adversely impact on the local highway, in terms of functioning and safety in compliance with NPPF Paragraph 116, LP Policy T6.1 and CS Policy CS7 and DM10, subject to final details via condition and legal agreement.  \r\rClimate Change and Sustainability: \r\rNPPF at para 161 sets an expectation that planning will support the transition to net zero by 2050. \r\rLP Policy SI 2 requires major development to be net zero-carbon. Although the subject application is not a major application, greenhouse gas emissions should be minimised to the greatest extent possible. \r\rCS Policy CS1 and DM3 states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe Design and Access Statement confirms the development incorporates both passive and active energy efficient design measures. The dwellings would be constructed, insulated and orientated and ventilated to reduce mechanical heating and cooling. Active design measures include PV panels and air source heat pumps. The proposal is considered to generally accord with LP Policy SI 2 and CS Policy DM1 and DM3. Final details would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. \rA condition would be secured requiring the proposed dwellings to achieve a mains water consumption of 105L or less per person per day, in line with LP Policy SI 5. \r\rOverall the scheme is acceptable on climate change and sustainability grounds. \r\rBiodiversity, Trees and Landscaping:\r\rNPPF at para 187 states planning designs should enhance and promote the conservation, restoration and enhancement of ecological matters and identify and pursue opportunities for securing measurable net gains for biodiversity. LP Policy G6 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain (BNG). CS Policy DM6 requires new development to promote landscaping as an integral part of a new development's design. \r\rThe Applicant claims the proposal would be subject to de minimise exemption for BNG. The Applicant has confirmed 2 trees within the car park were removed around 2023. BNG baseline assessments must be taken from January 2020 to account for situations where a site's habitat value is purposefully degraded to avoid the delivery of BNG. Officers are not convinced the de minimise threshold BNG exemption applies to the proposed development given there is evidence the site was cleared of habitat within 5 years of the scheme being submitted and this has not been considered in the baseline assessment, contrary to Paragraph 187 of the NPPF, LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. This carries weight against the scheme. \r\rThe loss of these trees has been considered within the landscaping scheme with the inclusion of 2 new trees within the front and rear garden which is supported. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, final details of the soft and hard landscaping would have been secured by condition. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rA Fire Statement Form (prepared by Fletcher Crane Architects) was submitted and demonstrates the proposed development would provide suitable means of evacuation, fire tender access and fire mitigation measures, in accordance with LP Policy D12. If the scheme was acceptable, the Fire Statement would have  been secured by condition to ensure compliance at the Building Regulation stage. \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. \r\rThe proposal would make a small contribution towards the borough's family housing supply which would carry positive weight in favour of the application, in compliance with LP Policy H1 and CS Policy CS10. The new home would provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants in compliance with LP Policy D6 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rA number of objections from neighbours has been received which raises concerns about the proposed car park layout and design elements that were committed to be delivered planning permission 20/01196/FUL. These are unresolved matters which the Applicant has confirmed requires further discussion with the commercial tenant. Insufficient information has been submitted to confirm whether the proposed car park arrangement could be provided without compromising the provision of cycle and waste storage for the existing tenants of James House and without impacting neighbouring amenity and vehicle movement along the highway, contrary to LP Policy D3 and T6 and CS Policy CS7 and DM10. \r\rOfficers consider the siting and scale of the proposed dwellinghouse to be uneighbourly and result in an overly dominant development right on the shared property boundary resulting in an unacceptable loss of daylight for neighbouring occupants, contrary to LP Policy D3 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rThe proposed front dormer, due to its poor siting and design, would be an incongruous feature within the host property and streetscape and would be detrimental to the character of the local area, contrary to LP Policy D3, CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 39 under the Residential Design SPD. \r\rInsufficient information has been submitted, in regard to a BNG baseline assessment, to determine the site's pre-development biodiversity value since 2020 and confirm whether a BNG exemption would be applicable, contrary to Paragraph 187 of the NPPF, LP Policy G6 and CS Policy DM6. \r\rNo legal agreement to ensure the proposed dwellinghouse is car-free within the Controlled Parking Zone which would result in adverse impacts on the function and safety of the highway, contrary to Paragraph 116 of the NPPF, LP Policy T6.1 and CS Policy CS7 and DM10. \r\rOfficers have taken into account the Housing Delivery Test tilted presumption in favour of development as set out in para 11 of the NPPF whilst considering the conflicts with the Development Scheme. For this scheme, the adverse impacts of the development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the Development Plan taken as a whole. As such, Officers recommend planning permission be refused.",
    "\rLand Contamination\r\r1. In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r2 Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\r3 The Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\rcarry out work to an existing party wall;\rbuild on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\rin some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an\tadjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\r4 Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from the landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\r5 The building/extension that you propose may affect a right of light enjoyed by the neighbouring property. This is a private right which can be acquired by prescriptive uses over 20 years; as such it is not affected in any way by the grant of planning permission.\r\r6 When undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\r7 You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\r8 Please note that this planning application has been assessed against current planning legislation only. The applicant (or any subsequent owner or developer) is therefore reminded that the onus of responsibility to ensure the proposed cladding installation meets current fire safety regulations lies fully with them and that they are legally obliged to apply for the relevant Building Regulations.\r\r9.The proposed development is located within 15m of Thames Water's underground assets, as such the development could cause the assets to fail if appropriate measures are not taken. Please read our guide 'working near our assets' to ensure your workings are in line with the necessary processes you need to follow if you're considering working above or near our pipes or other structures.\r\rhttps://developers.thameswater.co.uk/Developing-a-large-site/Planning-your-development/Working-near-or-diverting-our-pipes. \r\r11.the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins.  This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Highways Operation Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins.  \rThe team would secure some deposit to ensure that repairing cost is covered should any damage result from the construction associated with this site.\r\r12.A license from the Highways Operation will be required to erect off site direction signs.  This same team will issue the hoarding license (if necessary) and seek appropriate deposits.\r\r13. During construction, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway.  The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads.  We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris.  This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times. \r\r14.The applicant should be advised to consider if a parking suspension might be needed to allow access for big delivery construction vehicles involved.  To apply for parking suspension (if needed), the applicant should contact the Environment Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002. \r\r15.Any parking that cannot be contained within the site must park considerately and safely, so as not to obstruct sightlines at junctions or site accesses.  The applicant should be aware that any such parking will cause unnecessary concern and agitation within the local community; Should make full use of the site accesses to maximise the availability of off street parking\r\r16.Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient. \r\r17. The site is adjacent to the Network Rail corridor and the proposed route for the future delivery of Crossrail 2. The applicant should be aware that Crossrail 2 would result in a higher frequency of trains operating through Chessington South Station. In addition, works to deliver Crossrail 2 will be required at Chessington South Station. At present however, the Crossrail 2 project remains a proposal subject to future decisions by Government on both funding and powers to deliver the railway.\r\r18. Due to the close proximity of the proposed works to Network Rail's land and the operational railway, Network Rail requests the applicant / developer contacts Network Rail's Asset Protection and Optimisation (ASPRO) team via AssetProtectionWessex@networkrail.co.uk prior to works commencing. Network Rail's Asset Protection team will ensure the works can be completed without posing a risk to Network Rail's infrastructure. The applicant / developer may be required to enter into an Asset Protection Agreement to get the required resource and expertise on-board to enable approval of detailed works. More information can also be obtained from our website https://www.networkrail.co.uk/running-the-railway/looking-after-the-railway/asset-protection-and-optimisation/.\r\r19.\tThe applicant is reminded that they are solely responsible for any risk for noncompliance any standards that have been required at the time of the build by Secured By Design. Any changes made post certification which would impact the accreditation standards as required in the Secured By Design New Homes Guide, will void certification and any risk from non-compliance will lie with the persons responsible for the changes made without prior consultation with our offices. The current Secured by Design (SBD) requirements can be found in the design guides on the SBD web site www.securedbydesign.com\r\r20. A Deed of  Variation dated 04.02.2025 has been signed in association with this planning permission.",
    "Condition 15 (Construction Management Plan) - RBK Neighbourhood Engineer has reviewed the information submitted and is satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details are agreed and that Planning Condition 15 (Construction Management Plan) of planning permission 24/00979/FUL  is hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Proposal\rThe proposal seeks to extend the use of the air hall for indoor tennis use for an additional 2 months of the year. \r\rThe air hall is known by the Club as 'the dome'. It covers two hard tennis courts (numbers 5 and 6) located on the southern side of the site. The air hall comprises a double skin material that is inflated by compressor pumps. It has a rotating entrance door and an emergency exit door. It is lit internally during the permitted hours of use.\r\rConsent was granted for the air hall via planning permission 04/16225/FUL  subject to the condition: \r\r5. The airhall hereby permitted shall only be inflated from 1st October-31 st March each year. During the rest of the year, the airhall shall be permanently dismantled. \r\rReason: in the interest of the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring dwellings in accordance with Policies RL5 and H1of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames unitary Development Plan. \r\rThe submitted cover letter states: \r\rThe airhall has been used since 2005. The current application seeks to extend the  dates so that the airhall can be inflated for an additional two months of each year (ie in September and April). \r\rThe airhall courts are a vital facility for the Club and are very well used. For example, the utilisation rate for October - December 2024 was 84%.\r\rPoor weather impacts younger players the most. At present, a number of outdoor sessions (ie not in the airhall) have to be cancelled in April and September due to wet, cold and windy weather, as well as poor light. For example, during April 2024, three \rdays of junior coaching sessions were lost (out of a possible 24 days). During September 2024, four days of junior coaching sessions were lost (out of a possible 19 days) due to these reasons. There are between 5-10 coaching sessions on those days, so that resulted in up to 30 sessions missed in April and up to 40 sessions missed in September 2024. \rIf the airhall could be inflated during April and September, it would allow all coaching sessions to go ahead indoors, regardless of the weather and light conditions outside. Additionally, it would always allow the children's Easter holiday camps to take place \rindoors, increasing participation. \r\rThe ability to use the airhall for indoor tennis for an additional two months of the year (in September and April) would significantly improve the facilities at the Club, in particular for coaching sessions and opportunities for the younger players. This accords with policies GG3, S5, CS3, DM5, CS16, the NPPF, PPG and Sport England advice\r\rIn addition, we request that the words 'shall be permanently dismantled' are changed to 'shall be deflated and not used'. The end result would be the same (ie the air hall cannot be used outside of the dates 1 September to 30 April). The reason for the change of this wording is for practical reasons, as follows. \r\rIt takes a professional team of 15 people two days to prepare the air hall prior to inflation. The actual inflation process only takes approximately an hour. It then takes a team of 15 people two days to dismantle the air hall once it has been deflated, and then move it to storage on-site for the summer months. Therefore, currently, a total of four days of potential usage are lost during the setting-up and taking-down processes. By changing the wording from 'shall be permanently dismantled' to 'shall be deflated' will allow the airhall to be used for tennis for the full period between 1 September to 30 April.\r\rWe therefore request that Condition 5 is amended as follows:\rThe airhall hereby permitted shall only be inflated from 1 September - 30 April each year. During the rest of the year the airhall shall be deflated and not used.\r\rConsultation\r42 residents were notified by way of letter. No responses have been received. \rEnvironmental health: no objection \r\rAssessment\r\rOfficers consider that the proposal would enhance the provision of sporting facilities on site in accordance with London Plan policy S5. Furthermore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, loss of privacy or noise and disturbance. No concerns are raised with character and appearance. The case for the extension in the use of the air hall is compelling and would be in keeping with the development plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a 3 storey end terrace building containing a commercial unit on the ground floor. \r\rThe site is located with the Chiltern Drive Local Centre, a key area of change, a critical drainage area, the Borough Strategic Walking Network and the Borough Strategic Cycling Network\r\rProposal\r\rChange of use of the commercial unit from Class E (Commercial, Business, and Service Use) to Sui Generis (Tattoo Shop). The proposal does not involve any external changes to the existing building\r\r\rPublic Consultation\r20 residents were notified directly by way of letter. No responses have been received\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rThe principle of the change of use\rResidential amenity \rHighways \rFire safety \r\rChange of use \r\rPolicy DM17 states that the Council will protect, manage and enhance all employment land and premises in local centres so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods, services and employment. \r\rPolicy DM19 states that applications for change of use that would threaten the predominance of A1 uses (current Class E) will be resisted. It will also support local shops and resist their loss (particularly convenience shops) in Local Centres and outside designated centres.\r\rThe application site is located within the Chiltern Drive Local Centre. \r\rThe proposed use would result in the loss of a class E unit, and therefore a use that could lawfully be used for retail purposes, however, given the broad range of uses falling within Class E, it is no longer possible to completely protect the loss of A1 uses. A tattoo parlour would have the character of Class E use in many respects and provide an active frontage. Officers do not consider that the proposed use would conflict with the development plan in this regard. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  subject to the control of opening hours, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway impacts \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site is located within a PTAL Zone 2, however, is located very close to Berrylands railway station. It is unlikely that the proposed use would result in significant trip generation over and above any Class E use. It is noted that no car parking for staff and customers is proposed which would be appropriate in this case. \r\rThe London Plan would require a commercial space of this nature to provide 1 long stay cycle parking space and 1 short stay cycle parking space, and while the applicant has not provided details of the proposed cycle storage, officers consider that this could be secured via an appropriate condition in the event of an approval to ensure policy compliance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that there would be no significant traffic or transport impacts from the proposed change of use.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a reasonable exemption statement, however, it is unsatisfactory. The plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of single storey front extension, conversion of garage to habitable room and fenestration alterations \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises  a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r24/0012206/PAEXT - Erection of  single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3.4m and eaves height of 2.75m). Prior approval note required 10.06.24\r24/00557/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (6m depth, maximum height of 3.4m and eaves height of 2.75m). Prior approval refused 15.04.24\r24/00511/HOU - Erection of front porch extension and conversion of garage to habitable room. Associated changes to fenestrations. Granted 30.04.24\r18/14425/HOU - Erection of two storey front extension, new front porch and raised ridge height, front dormer extensions to facilitate  a loft conversion and elevational alterations. Granted 11.07.18\r646/1 (address 1A/1B Langley Grove) - Detached house. Granted 01.11.65\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey front extension, conversion of garage to habitable room and fenestration  alterations. \rmatch the size of existing. \r\rThe principle of a front porch extension and conversion of a garage into a habitable room was established through planning permission 24/00511/ HOU. \r\rThe current planning application seeks approval for a front  extension  which would include a front porch which would be deeper than the previous approval accompanied by a front extension of a similar depth. Overall, the proposed front extension would not exceed the depth  and therefore  the existing front building line  of the existing garage. \r\rOfficers note the proposed fenestration alterations and the inclusion of obscure glazing on the left and right proposed elevation of  dwelling and extension\r\rThe proposal also seeks to convert the integral garage into a habitable room.This would result in the loss of the garage door and  introduction of replacement windows and surround brickwork  which would be of a similar appearance to the existing main windows  within the front elevation of the dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey front extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space into a habitable room. The area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety. \r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r6 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development.  1 letter of objection received and states : \r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy \r\rThese material considerations will be included within the assessment. \r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer  - no objection even with the removal of 2 tree T01 and T01 both category 'C' low quality\r\rRBK LLFA - recommend more evidence submitted to LPA to demonstrate that run off from the terrace and its direct discharge to boundary plants will not increase flood risk to neighbouring properties particularly no13.

Granted 17.06.70\r2578/MC - Alterations and additions. Granted 19.12.57\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Biodiversity\r- Impact on Trees\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Impact on Flood Risk & Drainage\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks demolition of front porch and replacement of the tile hanging with render on main front gable. Demolition of single storey east side lean to and erection of a single storey side infill extension. Erection of first floor rear and rear dormer roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion. Alterations to windows and doors. Rear terrace to be extended.\r\rOfficers' response to the proposed design changes are set below.\r\rThe principle of the removal and reconfiguration of the non original front entrance porch, door and overlights is considered acceptable. However,  the removal of the existing hanging tiles on the front and west elevation would not be supported as they are considered to be a notable feature of the dwelling  contributing to the character, architectural style, design as well as the age of the building as well as contributing towards the character and appearance of the immediate area and the Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.   It is also considered that the existing  hanging tiles have a biodiversity value to the dwelling. This is addressed further in the Heritage Assets  and Biodiversity section of this report. \r\rThe proposed external extensions and  internal design alterations both external and internal  to the ground floor level of the dwelling are considered  to be acceptable.  Officers note the external rear terrace is to be enlarged with a lower perimeter boundary wall  which in principle is deemed acceptable, however further comments are provided in the flood risk section of this report. \r\rIn terms of the proposed first floor extensions, Officers note these would be contained within the built footprint of the ground floor and have a render finish to match the existing ground floor extension.  The introduction of the first floor extensions would result in the creation of a first floor terrace which would be  enclosed by a glazed balustrade. Glazed juliette balustrades are proposed on new rear elevations at first floor level.\r\rThe proposed first floor extensions would duly result in the loss of the existing rear shallow  pitched roof dormers  and present flat roofs. A proposed rear dormer extension would sit comfortably on the rear roofslope.\r\rThe proposal also includes  alterations to all windows and doors on the rear elevation at ground level and introduction  of new windows on both the east and west elevations.  Should Officers  be minded to approve the application, an appropriate  planning condition would be attached to the decision requiring further details to be provided on the  new and replacement windows and specifically identified windows to present obscure glazing.  \r\rIn terms of landscaping, Officers note the retention of the existing close boarded timber/ fence wall between no 11 and no9 as well as the boundary with no 13 to remain as existing. Existing foliage on the side boundaries, the adjacent neighbours are largely screened from views of the house.  \r\rTo conclude, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of form and design  in relation to the loss of the existing hanging tiles on the front elevation of the dwelling. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the  dwelling itself as well as upon the immediate area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the site's topography together with the  density of the existing foliage and boundary treatment along the site boundaries between the application site and neighbouring properties  providing heavy screening between the neighbouring  properties. In addition, it is considered that these  existing attributes minimise or have no impact in terms of daylight  and therefore amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rWhilst the introduction of the balcony on the first floor  would overlook the rear garden of the dwelling ,  the outlook would be no different from  the introduction of a new window on the rear elevation at this level. Officers note the terrace would provide a limited view towards neighbouring no9, however views are likely to be obscured by foliage/ landscaped boundaries.\r\rOfficers note the introduction of new windows at ground  and first floor level on both side elevations would present obscured glazing and therefore outlook would be limited.  \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rBiodiversity \rParagraphs 187 - 195 in the NPPF (2024) addresses conserving and enhancing the natural environment.  Paragraph 193  sets out the principles that Local Planning Authorities should apply when determining planning applications. \r\rPolicy G6 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net diversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process. Policy DM6 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echoes these principles. \r\rThe accompanying Biodiversity checklist identified the application site being located within 50m of  native woodland including ancient semi natural and replanted woodland and veteran (particularly old/ large) trees. \r\rA Preliminary Ecological Appraisal  (PEA) and Roost Assessment accompanied the application   and Officers note the statement that the dwelling has a high roosting habitat value for bats including the potential for the roof space to support a maternity roost due to a number of identified features  externally on the roof including the existing hanging tiles.  However, the application is not supported by a bat emergence/ re- entry survey together with any other necessary ecological survey work , therefore Officers are unable to fully assess the  full biodiversity value of the site and consider potential appropriate mitigation measures.  \r\rGiven lack of a bat survey and other ecological survey work, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not adversely affect the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site, contrary to policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rImpact on Trees\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) states that the Council will expect new development  to ensure that trees are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided . \r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan (2021) states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained (Category A, B and lesser category trees where these are considered  by the local planning authority to be of importance to amenity and biodiversity,as defined by BS 5837:2012).\r\rThe site resides  within TPO Areas Order :MAC.06.56 Ref :A3 Area Order. RBK Tree and Landscape Officer has reviewed the proposal and has raised no objection. The Officer considered the  impacts to any trees on or off site are either none  at all or low impact.  \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 207 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rParagraph 216  states the effect of an application on the significance of a non designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining an application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset. \r\rThe site is located within the  Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non designated heritage asset.  Officers note the  existing open character and landscaping/ access arrangement of the front boundary treatment of the application site which leads directly onto Neville Avenue.  As a  result,  the existing front elevation  of the dwelling showcasing  distinct  architectural style features  in terms of materials and finishes, in particular the existing hanging tiles, are visually  prominent  from both  Neville Avenue  and on the approach from Warren Rise, positively  contributing towards the existing streetscene. and  in the immediate vicinity.  It is considered that the loss of the existing hanging tiles on the front and west elevations of the dwelling would have an adverse impact on  both the character and appearance of the dwelling itself,the immediate streetscene  and its contribution towards the Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of  Special Character. It is therefore considered that the proposal would  be contrary  with Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFlood  Risk and Drainage\rPolicy D11 ( C) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that development proposals should maximise building resilience  and minimise potential  physical risks, including those arising as a  result of extreme weather, fire, flood and related hazards.\r\rThe application was accompanied by the submission of a SUDS statement.  RBK  Lead Local Flood Authority (LLFA)  have reviewed this statement together with the Arboricultural  Impact Assessment . Officers noted that the current rear terrace drains to the rear garden landscaping and the  run off from the extended terrace  to be  managed via rain gardens which would discharge into the existing boundary planting to support the existing watering regime.\r\rLLFA officers raise concern in terms of the overall size of the terrace and the drainage of water into the rain gardens  with the discharge unrestricted  into the boundary planting. No detail has been provided as to whether the existing landscaping together with the site topography would prevent run off from the application  site from impacting the adjacent properties.   \r\rLLFA is recommending that more evidence is provided to demonstrate that run off from the terrace and its direct discharge towards boundary planting would not increase the flood risk to neighbouring properties particularly  no 13. This is in accordance with para 181 NPPF (2024)\r\rIn the absence of this information LLFA and RBK Officers are unable to fully assess the proposal in the context of the \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\r\rConclusion \rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, erection of front bay window extension\r\rConsultation\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed bay window would improved the overall apperance of the property and would reflect the bay windows of the surrounding properties. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Other Side Elevation - Please provide Existing and Proposed Side Elevations showing the perspective from the other neighbour's side.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of outbuildings and erection of two-storey rear extension, and rear hip to gable and side dormer roof extensions, Juliet balcony and installation of 2no. front and 2no. side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Erection of single storey rear and side extensions. Conversion of garage to habitable room. Changes to fenestrations.\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed with this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the recent planning permission ref 24/01294/HOU (Demolition of outbuildings and erection of two-storey rear extension, single storey rear and side extension. Conversion of garage to habitable accommodation. Changes to fenestrations.) granted on 22.07.2025.\r\rThe current scheme is for the same scope of work as the approved ones under planning permission ref 24/01294/HOU and, in addition, proposes rear hip to gable roof extension with Juliet balcony and two side dormer roof extensions. There would be no increase in the total height of the dwelling.\r\rAs such, the principle of the two storey rear extension and single storey wrap around extension has been established, planning permission ref 24/01294/HOU.\r\rThe proposed rear hip to gable roof extension with Juliet balcony, given its scale, siting and the proposed design is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling. \r\rGiven the modest scale of the side dormers and its significant set back from the front elevation, they are considered to be acceptable and in accordance with Policy 39.\r\rOfficers note similar side dormers present within Linkside, as such the proposal would be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised within the written representation with regards to the impact of the proposal on the adjoining properties. \r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at No 18.\r\rOfficers note the irregular siting of the neighbouring property No 16. It has been demonstrated on the submitted plans that the proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the the existing secondary bedroom window at the first floor (obscure glazed and fixed below 1.7m as per planning permission 17/14223/HOU for Erection of two storey side and single storey rear extension) at this adjoining property. \r\rGiven the scale and siting of the proposal and size of the plot, it is considered that it would not appear as an overbearing when viewed from the neighbouring properties.\r\rA relevant condition would be attached for all the new openings above the ground floor level in both side elevations to be obscure glazed and non openable below 1.7m, to ensure no adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining properties in terms of an undue overlooking or loss of privacy.  \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy Report, which is considered acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Condition 4 (Dust and Emissions) of planning permission 21/00646/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of the development the applicant must submit details of how dust and emissions during construction and demolition are to be controlled. The submitted Dust Management Plan must incorporate the recommendations of Appendix A6 of the Air Quality Assessment dated February 2021 and shall have regard to the GLA SPG on the Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction and Demolition.\r\rReason: This information is required prior to the commencement of development to ensure adequate protections are put in place to protect local air quality and comply with Policy SI 1 of the London Plan (2021) and the GLA SPG Control of Dust and Emissions During Construction.\r\rEnvironmental Health Officer comment: Thank you for consulting the Pollution Control Team on the above application. I have looked at the document submitted to discharge condition 4 (ref. 241865/CEMP/AG/KL/01, dated 12/02/25).\r\rThe document currently consists of a Air Quality Dust Risk Assessment (AQDRA) only, which means it does not yet satisfy the requirements of a Dust Management Plan, as described within the guidance provided by the GLA's 2014 The Control of Dust and Emission from Demolition and Construction SPG.\r\rThe SPG requires that a Dust Management Plan typically includes the following:\r\r- Summary of work to be carried out;\r- Description of site layout and access - including proposed haul routes, location of site equipment including supply of water for damping down, source of water (wherever possible from dewatering or extraction), drainage and enclosed areas to prevent contaminated water leaving the site;\r- Inventory and timetable of all dust and NOx air pollutant generating activities;\r- Results of an Air Quality (Dust) Risk Assessment (see Chapter 4);\r- List of all dust and emission control methods to be employed (see Chapter 5);\r- Details of any fuel stored on-site;\r- Identification of a trained and responsible person on-site for air quality.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38 (6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004  states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate  otherwise. \r\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\r The application site resides within Flood Zone 2\r\rProposal \rThe  current planning application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established. On such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary  and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application. In assessing the application, Officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since granting the original permission. \r\rPermission was granted under  24/01684/HOU dated  16 September 2024 for the Demolition of conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension . \r\rAs noted before the principle of development has already been established as this application  seeks  amendments to the following:\rRetention of rear (now built) extension wall (and foundations) to 3650mm from the house wall \rIncrease height rear extension ( Officer measurements Approved 3.158m , proposed 3.358m)\rChange of colour of the sliding doors to black - \rInstallation of 400 x 500 H window in the ground floor toilet \rRaise height of front rooflight ( Repositioned higher on roof slope)\rRemoval small window from first floor bathroom \rInstall 600 x 900 rooflight on loft  roof  \r\r\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment :\r\rOfficers have reviewed and assessed the proposed amendments to the development in the context of the previous planning  permission ( ref : 24/01684/HOU). It is noted from the  submission that works have commenced on site.  In respect of the installation of a small window to serve  the ground floor toilet, should Officers be minded to approve this amendment, the applicant is advised that an appropriate  additional planning condition would be attached to a planning permission ensuring that the  window would have obscure glazing. \r\rOverall,   the  proposed development is  considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development .\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its siting in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely  affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPD.\r\rOfficer Comment : The application is accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment which identifies the site falling within Flood Risk Zone 2. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is not lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rThe submitted Flood Risk Assessment which accompanied  planning permission (ref : 24/01684/HOU) appears to have been produced in accordance with the Environment Agency standing advice. A revised Flood Risk Assessment  was not submitted to accompany this application  and on that basis Officers consider there to be no change to the scope nor principle of the original document to impact upon the decision of this application.   In the event of an approval, Officers would consider it appropriate to impose a planning condition requesting that ground floor power sockets be located a minimum of 450mm above FFL (700mm above the maximum flood level) in order to provide an additional safety measure.\r\rFire safety  \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has  not resubmitted a Reasonable Exception Statement to support this application.   On this basis, the previously approved Reasonable Exception Statement remains extant  in the context of this decision. Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the 3.1 Hogsmill And Berrylands Area of Archaeological Significance. The small part of the rear boundary falls within the Flood Zone 2.\r\rProposal \rConversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, erection of a single storey rear and front porch extension.\r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Highway Safety\r- Fire Safety\r- Archeology\r- Flood Risk\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth, which is up to 3.5m for semi detached properties. However, considering the listing of the proposal, the proposed scale and design, the proposal is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed conversion of garage into a habitable space and erection of front porch extension are considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the existing street scene.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to both adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an uncaptable loss of daylight in relation to both adjoining properties.\r\rIt is noted that the adjoining No 106 benefits from a rear extension as per submitted photographs of the site.\r\rWith regards to No 102, considering the existing situation and the proposed scale and design of the rear extension, it is considered that it would not appear as an overbearing when viewed from this adjoining property. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Elmbridge Avenue. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form and Flood Risk Response Statement submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling. A relevant condition would be attached to ensure that appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development. \r \rArcheology\rThe application site is situated within the Archaeological Priority Areas - 3.1 Hogsmill And Berrylands Area of Archaeological Significance. According to the archaeological risk model provided by Greater London Archaeology Advisory Service, any householder developments situated within the Tier 3 Archaeological Priority Area are posing negligible risk, which means developments only rarely causing harm to heritage assets of archaeological interest and hardly ever causing significant harm.\r\rAs such, due to the  modest scale of the proposal and its siting, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in significant harm to heritage assets of archaeological interest. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement and Dwg ref 05 Proposed Fire Plans which are considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "4 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  1 letter of objection has been received regarding the following summarised concerns:\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rOfficer response:\rThe application has been assessed using BRE guidance in relation to loss of daylight/sunlight.\rCondition A.4. (7) of (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 states that where an owner or occupier of any adjoining premises objects to the proposed development, the prior approval of the local planning authority is required as to the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of any adjoining premises.\r\r\rThe proposed extension would  result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and would fail the 45o test with regards to daylight as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD in relation to No. 5 Ellingham Road. The applicant has failed to provide any evidence that the loss of light would be to a non habitable room. The proposed extension would be deep and hard up against the boundary with No. 5 Ellingham road and would result in an overbearing and unneighbourly addition due to the limited depth of the rear gardens. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have a significant and unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties.",

The rear elevation would present  bifolding doors and a single window. A proposed first floor rear extension would sit within the built footprint of the proposed ground floor rear extension and have a width of 3.5m.  A dual pitch roof is proposed that would relate well with the existing main roof of the dwelling.   Within the terrace blocks along Porchester Road, Officers note there are similar examples of  part two storey/ part single storey rear extensions.\r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the  part two storey/ part single storey rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r9no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension.  \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor flat.\r\rThe application site falls within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning History\r24/00562/FUL  - Erection of a single storey rear extension. Refused 13.06.24. Appeal dismissed 20.11.24 (APP/Z5630/W/24/3348554)\r23/02900/FUL Erection of single storey rear extension . Changes to side fenestration . Refused 15.12.23. Appeal dismissed  21.06.24 (APP/Z5630/D/24/3340103)\r\rThe appeal decisions relating to this application site are material considerations  in the assessment and determination of this planning application. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for a single storey rear extension.  \r\rThe application site forms part of an open 'courtyard' space which has been divided by a 1.77m close boarded fence.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would extend a depth of 3.45m and a new build width of 2.9m infilling the open 'courtyard' space to the rear of the dwelling.  It would have a  single aspect pitch roof with an eaves height of 2m which would sit above the existing fence level. The proposed roof would have concrete tiles to match existing and dark grey ply with flat roof position to include a single roof light. Fenestration changes are also proposed on both the rear and side elevation.\r\rCompared with the previously refused schemes, Officers note the depth  of the proposed extension  remains unchanged  with the proposed side elevation wall positioned directly along the shared boundary  with adjoining neighbouring ground floor flat,  no 5 Vale Crescent.  The proposal would comply  with the recommendations as set out in Policy Guidance 33  in the Residential Design SPD.  \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact of daylight and sunlight  of the proposed rear extension using BRE degree rule and Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on the neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is No5 Vale Crescent, the adjoining neighbouring ground floor flat. \r\rGiven the siting and scale of the proposed development along the shared boundary with No5 Vale Crescent and taking account of the proposed design changes in terms of height and depth, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in the significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room at ground level.\r\rThe application site has been the subject of two previous RBK planning refusals  and two dismissed appeal decisions.  These planning decisions are material considerations in determining the  current application. \r\rOfficers have considered the Inspectors  observations and judgement as set out in paragraphs 7, 8, 9  and 10 of appeal decision (APP/Z5630/W/24/3348554) :\r\r'7. At the time of my site visit I noted that the area to the rear of No5 immediately outside of the property within the gap between the outriggers, contained chairs and appeared to be in use as an area  for the occupiers of the property to sit out. Furthermore, a ground floor window and French doors are situated in the rear elevation of No5,  very close to the shared boundary. The window in fact, looks directly towards the boundary fence.  \r\r8. Due to its design and proximity, the proposed extension would enclose the rear of No5, creating a tunnelling effect. When viewed from No5 the proposed extension would appear as a highly  prominent, large, solid and featureless outlook and a harmful sense of enclosure. The proposal would, therefore, cause unacceptable harm to the living conditions of the occupiers of the neighbouring property at No5 Vale Crescent with particular regard to outlook.\r\r9 I accept that the rear of No5 is already close to the appeal property and that the outlook from No 5 is already towards a constrained area between the two storey rear projections at Nos 1 and 5. However, the proposal would unacceptably worsen the existing situation to such a degree that it would have an unduly detrimental effect on the living conditions of the occupiers of No5. \r\r10. For these reasons the proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan, adopted 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy,adopted April 2012. Amongst other things, these policies seek to ensure proposals are well designed and have regard to amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of outlook, daylight and avoidance of visual intrusion.'\r\rIrrespective of the proposed design changes in terms of the height to the proposed single storey extension, based on the siting and scale  of the extension within the existing  small courtyard,   Officers maintain their  previous planning judgement and endorse the Inspectors conclusions  that the proposed development would continue to be clearly visible from No5 Vale Crescent. The proposal  would constitute  an unneighbourly form of development  presenting an overbearing appearance  for the ground floor neighbour  giving rise  to an unreasonable loss of outlook  and increased sense of enclosure  to the habitable room windows within No 5. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance  and increased sense of enclosure. \r\rImpact on heritage assets\rParagraphs 195 to 208 of the NPPF (December 2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 of the NPPF (December 2023)  states the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the  application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss of the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application site falls within Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non designated heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would not have any adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not harm the significance of the Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan as taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. \r\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the recent planning history: 23/02210/HOU (Erection of single storey rear extension and changes to fenestrations) refused on 05.10.2025 due to an adverse impact on the amenities of the neighbouring property. \r\rThe current scheme proposes slightly reduced depth of the extension and lowered eaves height to the east elevation, which is considered to be acceptable. The proposed total mass and bulk of the single storey rear extension is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that the adjoining property No 3 benefits from a single storey rear extension. The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at No 3. \r\rThe submitted proposed plans demonstrate that the proposal would not result in an uncaptable loss of daylight or loss of outlook in relation to the nearest habitable bedroom window at the adjoining ground floor maisonette, No 12 Thornhill Avenue. As such, it is considered that the applicant has successfully addressed the previous reason for refusal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
