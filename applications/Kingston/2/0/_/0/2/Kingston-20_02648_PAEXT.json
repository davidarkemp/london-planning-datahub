    "The proposed extension and alterations are considered not to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.3 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rThe application site is a corner property located within Coombe Wood Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rUnder the provisions of Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, this application seeks to vary Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission 21/02656/FUL (Erection of two-storey detached house with rooms in roof space and integral garage (following demolition of existing house)) dated 16.11.2021. Variation to consist of changes to the interior layout, and external changes to the facade, materials and rooflights\r\rConsultations:\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rMalden and Coombe Hill Conservation Area Advisory Committee - no response received. \r\rProposal:\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed changes would include a new roof form (mansard roof) and alterations and relocation of the skylights. It is noted that  there would be no increase in the total height of the building. The parapet walls would be raised and finished with a rendered detail. The approved green roof over the garage area would be replaced by a membrane roof.\r\rIn addition to the above amendments, the applicant proposed the following changes to the elevations:\rFront elevation:\rSingle column to the entrance porch \rAlterations to fenestration, installation of a dormer window instead of a rooflight\r\rNorth side elevation\rAlterations to fenestration, addition of one window to the first floor and 4 no rooflights to the second floor (instead of a dormer window)\r\rSouth side elevation\rAlterations to fenestration, removal of a window to the first floor, addition of two rooflights\r\rRear Elevation\rAlterations to fenestration, removal of Juliet balconies and the rear balcony, installation of an additional window at the first floor level and a dormer window instead of a rooflight at the second floor level. \r\rOverall, the proposed changes set out above are considered to be acceptable in design terms due to their sympathetic, proportionate and subordinate nature. They would not be significantly different to that approved under parent planning permission 21/02656/FUL. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: Having regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposed alterations would not result in any harm to the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed alterations would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the conservation area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposal  would  not result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alterations due to its scale and siting would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTo ensure no adverse impact on the adjoining property, all openings inserted at the first and second floor levels in the south elevation shall be obscure glazed and non openable below 1.7m when measured from the finished floor level, as per original condition attached to planning permission 21/02656/FUL.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rSummary\rIn conclusion, the proposed amendments to Condition 2 (approved plans) would not result in a material difference in terms of character and appearance of the proposed development or adversely impact the neighbouring amenity. The conclusions in respect of all other matters remain unchanged from the previously approved application ref no 21/02656/FUL.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.\r",
