    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at Nos. 240 and 242 Hook Road. The proposed rear dormer extension, by virtue of its design, size and bulk, would fail to appear as a subservient addition. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 and paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
