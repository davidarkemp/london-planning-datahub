    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the southern elevation wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rConsultations\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to the potential impact of the proposal on the access track to the side of the property. \r\rOfficers are satisfied that the correct Ownership Certificate has been signed for the purposes of assessing this planning application. Any boundary dispute would be a civil matter.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the ground floor rear extension would not respect Policy Guidance 33, of the residential design SPD in regards to the flat roof height of approximately 3.2m and a total depth of approximately 6.6m. However, the proposed rear extension would not be an incongruous addition to The Ridings are several neighbouring properties in the vicinity benefit from a similar extension. On balance, officers consider the proposed rear extension to be acceptable in regard to character and appearance.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed two storey side extension would also not be set in from the boundary by 1m, however, officers would not consider this a detrimental issue, as the gap has already been eroded by the existing garage and Neighbouring property No.44 The Ridings sits at a reasonable distance from the boundary. Additionally, the proposal would not be at odds in the vicinity of The Ridings or with the adjoining neighbouring property No.40 The Ridings. The proposal would involve a pitched roof which would resemble the existing roof and the applicant demonstrates matching material and similar fenestration use to the exterior of the dwelling, preserving the appearance of the host dwelling. \r\rAlthough the extension of the garage conversion/extension would protrude further out, in line with the front wall of the dwelling, this would not be incongruous to the vicinity of The Ridings, as many dwellings on this road also benefit from similar extensions and it would generally follow the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 38, which states:\r\r- Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window.\r- New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition.\r- Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation.\r- The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house.\r- All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties.\r- Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension and the two storey side extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rules and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The dimensions of the proposed garage would safely accommodate on-site car parking, as such, would comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Additionally, despite the minor extension to the front of the dwelling, the remaining hardstanding to the front of the property would still provide an adequate car parking space, which would be acceptable levels of on-site car parking. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
