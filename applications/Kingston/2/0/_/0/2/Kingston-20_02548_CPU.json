    "The proposal would involve a material change of use and would therefore constitute development as defined by Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rTwo Storey Side/ First Floor Extension-\rThe proposed two storey side/ first floor extension would comply with the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of being set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps. It would also be set down and set back from the front elevation to appear subordinate. Additionally, the adjoining neighbouring property No.8 The Ridings benefits from a two storey side extension, therefore, officers conclude that the proposed extension would not unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings but rather create similarity.\r\rGarage Extension/Front Extension-\rAlthough the extension of the garage conversation/extension would protrude further out, in line with the front wall of the dwelling, this would not be incongruous to the vicinity of The Ridings, as many dwellings on this road also benefit from similar extensions and it would generally follow the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 38, which states:\r\r- Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window.\r- New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition.\r- Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation.\r- The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house.\r- All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties.\r- Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rSingle Storey Rear Extension-\rThe single storey rear extension would not strictly comply with the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of height. The proposed flat roof height is demonstrated as 3.3m which is 0.3m more than the guidance in Policy Guidance 33. However, the rear extension would have a modest depth of 1.8m and it is considered that the proposal would appear a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host building.\r\rRear Dormer and Gable-End Extension -\rOfficers note that the proposed dormer would not maintain a 500mm distance from the eaves, sides, or ridge and that the proposed hip-to-gable extension would not create symmetry between the pair of semi-detached dwellings, however, this form of development would not be incongruous in the immediate vicinity of The Ridings. The bulk of the rear roof extension would be hidden from the streetscene, as the dormer would be to the rear of the dwelling and the applicant proposes materials to match the existing dwelling. Notwithstanding the above, the dwelling benefits from permitted development rights and as such, the roof extension could be constructed without the need for planning permission subject to conditions and limitations.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment:  Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD, to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. The loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, a condition requiring details of cycle parking will be imposed.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please amend the Site Location Plan to include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway.\rNote: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, car parking and open areas around buildings).\r"
