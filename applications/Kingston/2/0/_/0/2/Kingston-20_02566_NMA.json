    "The Council considers the amendments to be non-material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment be granted.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is a two-storey mid-terrace dwellinghouse located on Queens Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension, and L-shaped dormer roof extension to facilitate loft conversion with two front rooflights and Juliet balcony\r\rThis application follows recently refused application 22/01327/HOU dated 01.07.2022 which was refused for the following reason:\r\r1)The excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 6 Queens Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 6 Queens Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and therefore, taking all factors into consideration reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis reason for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey pitched roof rear extension. This extension would measure approximately 7.1 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse, and approximately 2.4 metres to eaves height on boundary with No. 6 Queens road. Whilst the proposed extension would exceed the recommended depth of 3.5 metres as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, and would have an acceptable impact on its character. \r\rFurthermore, the application proposes the construction of a flat roof L-shaped dormer extension to the rear roofslope of the original dwellinghouse as well as the rear roof of the outrigger. Whilst this element of the proposal would not strictly conform to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed L-shaped dormer would not be an uncharacteristic addition to the roofscape of Queens Road. \r\rFinally the application proposes the installation of two rooflights to the front roofslope of the dwellinghouse. Officers consider that these are appropriate additions to a site in residential use and would not detract from the character of the dwellinghouse or area. \r\rAs such, Officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 2 and No. 6 Queens Road. In relation to No. 2 Queens Road, this neighbouring property benefits from a single storey rear extension. Due to the siting of the proposed development in relation to this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight to this neighbouring property or an overbearing appearance. As no windows are proposes facing this property, Officers consider the proposed would not result in a loss of privacy. \r\rIn relation to No. 6 Queens Road, the proposed extension would be set in from the boundary by 0.2m and would have an eaves height of 2.4m. Due to theses amendments to the application, officers consider that on balance, the proposed development would no longer have an overbearing appearance or result in an undue sense of enclosure to the adjoining property at No. 6 Queens Road.\r\rFurthermore, Officers consider that the applicant has now demonstrated through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 6 Queens Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. \r\rThe application does not propose any windows facing this neighbouring property and as such will not result in a loss of privacy. \r\rThe previous reason for refusal has therefore been addressed.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which is considered compliant with Policy D12.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
