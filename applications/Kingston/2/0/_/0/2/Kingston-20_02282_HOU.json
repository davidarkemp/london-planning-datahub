    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "A sample, or a manufacturing specification and photograph, of the cladding materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the installation of any cladding. The development shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. These details are required prior to the installation of any cladding because the details could affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the first floor side elevation walls of the extensions hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The flat roof(s) of the extensions hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Condition 29 (Residential Car Parking) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of development (other than demolition, site enabling works) in any Phase or Development Plot, details of the number, layout, location and access to residential car parking spaces to be provided for that phase shall be submitted to the local planning authority for approval and then provided and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r\rReason: To avoid creating unacceptable traffic congestion on the surrounding road network and ensure there would be adequate parking and servicing for the development and no adverse transport impacts from the development.\r\rOfficer response: The revised information provided by the applicant is considered to be sufficient.\r\rThe Council's Highways Engineer offered the following comments:\r\rHighways have reviewed the details and tracking information submitted as part of discharge of Condition 29. Highways is satisfied that there will be no adverse impacts on the highway network from the proposed manoeuvres for access and egress from the parking bays. Arrangements shown in drawing Vehicle swept path - 23181-MA-XX-XX-D-0010 are acceptable at this stage.\rHowever, highways feels that a similar arrangement elsewhere in the wider site could cause issues at later stages where the public footway is sandwiched between the development and the proposed off street parking for the development. This should be addressed in later phases.\r\rAs such, the revised details submitted in relation to Condition 29 (Residential Car Parking) for Plot E Phase 1 only are hereby approved.",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans/documents submitted for the purposes of this application are consistent with the parent planning permission reference 20/02942/FUL, however, any inconsistencies would be resolved in favour of the parent permission. An Application for Approval of Details Reserved by Condition should not be used to evolve or modify the scheme in a way that is substantially different from that set out in the application.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 7 (Cycle Parking) of planning permission 22/03503/HOU, which states:\r\rCondition 7 (Cycle Parking) - Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rThe cycle parking facilities as shown in the approved details shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained for that purpose and kept free from obstruction thereafter.\r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Condition 34 (Wind Mitigation) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of development (other than demolition and site enabling works) in any Phase or Development Plot (Other than Phase 1), details of mitigation for wind, including roof top enclosures, to be submitted for approval in writing by the Local Planning Authority for that phase. The scheme approved by the Local Planning Authority shall be fully implemented and maintained. \r\rReason: To achieve an acceptable wind climate within the public realm.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted information is considered to be sufficient. As such, the condition  34 (Wind Mitigation) in relation to Plot B, Phase 1 is hereby approved.",

The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "The submitted floor plan does hot have a stated scale.\rPlease provide Existing and Proposed Floor Plans to show the position of A/C unit at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.
