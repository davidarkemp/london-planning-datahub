    "The proposed single storey side and rear extension, by reason of its depth, flat roof form, lack of separation distance from the shared boundary with No. 22 Beresford Avenue and lack of set back from the front elevation would fail to be both proportionate and subordinate and would not relate well to the host property.  In combination with the loss of the front porch which is an original feature of the property, the proposed extensions and alterations would be incongruous and would detract from the character and appearance of the original property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
