    "The proposed erection of rear dormer roof extensions to the main and outrigger roof and the installation of a front rooflight to facilitate a loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwellinghouse which has been split into a ground floor and first floor flat. The site is located in a suburban area.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History 23/00076/FUL - Installation of a privacy screen to allow use of an existing flat roof to the rear of the property as roof terrace - Refused 13.03.2023\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application with a similar proposal for a 2.8m deep terrace which would be located on top of the existing 3m deep single storey rear extension. The proposal also included the erection of a 1.8m high and obscured glazed privacy screens. The applicant has revised the proposal by reducing the width of the terrace, creating a distance from the boundaries of 800m on both sides and reducing the height of the screening towards the rear to 1.1m, however, maintaining the maximum height of 1.8m on the sides. \r\rThe proposed development to the mid-terraced dwelling would be considered unacceptable in terms of scale and spacing. The proposed 2.8m deep terrace with privacy screens would create a bulky structure to the terraced building which would be highly visible from neighbouring properties. The proposed balcony would be in close proximity to a number of neighbouring properties with insufficient separation distances in what is a suburban area. The balcony would introduce a new and incongruous form of development which would be highly prominent when viewed from neighbouring properties.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposal would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is noted that the site address is a mid-terraced dwelling and the proposed development to the first floor would be situated very close to the habitable windows of the adjoining properties. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and noise and disturbance. There would also be a loss of privacy to the ground floor flat with the newly proposed clear glazing. The proposed development would therefore be unneighbourly and have an unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
