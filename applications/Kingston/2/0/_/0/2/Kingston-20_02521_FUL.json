    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\r17 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received by a neighbouring property which has been taken into consideration for this assessment.\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would be approximately 4m deep, the proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.2m (above the existing single storey extension) and the total height of approximately 3m (above the single storey extension).\r\rThe proposed extension would be adjoining the common boundary with No 32 Bonner Hill Road, the separation distance to No 28 Bonner Hill Road would be approximately 2.3m. \r\rThe submitted proposed elevations drawing shows changes to No 32 Bonner Hill Road, however, this site falls outside the application site. This application will be assessed against the existing situation as well as having regard to any relevant approvals next door. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed rear extensions to the first floor on terraced properties are usually not recommended due to separation distances issue, however in this case, due to the proposed modest scale of the extension, its design and siting is considered to appear in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.  \r\rTherefore, it is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and the proposed extension is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe concerns in relation to the use of the flat roof of the approved single storey rear extension are noted, however, this would be controlled via conditions of planning permission 22/03352/HOU. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
