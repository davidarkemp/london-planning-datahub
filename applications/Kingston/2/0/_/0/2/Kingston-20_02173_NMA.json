    "The Council considers the amendments to be non-material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment be granted",
    "Condition 8 (Landscaping Scheme) of planning permission 19/03124/FUL states:\rThe development hereby approved shall not be occupied until a landscaping scheme has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority including planting of trees, shrubs, plants and areas to be grassed. The landscaping shall be carried out in the first planting season after commencement of the development unless agreed otherwise in writing by the Local Planning Authority, and shall be maintained for a period of 5 years. Such maintenance shall include the replacement of any shrubs and trees that die. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision and maintenance of trees, other plants and grassed areas in the interests of visual amenity and in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy Adopted (2012).\r\rOfficer response: The Council's Tree and Landscape Officer confirmed that the plan submitted by the applicant for this purpose is insufficient as it does not provide details of species, latin names, numbers, planting densities and sizes at time of planting.\r\rThe applicant is advised that any changes/extensions to the existing dropped kerb in order to form a new vehicular access would require a separate planning application and this element should not be included in a discharge of condition application.",
    "The lawful application does not benefit from a free go. \rRegulation 9 of the Fee Regulations. Regulation 9(b) only covers \"an application for planning permission which is made following the refusal of planning permission\" an application for a lawful development certificate is not an Application for Planning Permission. Regulation 1b of the same Regulations identifies Lawful Development Certificate applications as being different to Planning applications\r\rThe fee required for your planning application is Â£ 103.00.  Payment can be made online via the Kingston council website, or our Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002."
