    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent evidence that the loss of on-site car parking spaces would not have a detrimental effect in relation to highway safety in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O.2 (1) (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order (England) 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to submit sufficient evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would incorporate adequate flood resilience and resistance measures and would provide safe and dry access/egress in times of a flood event, as such, based on the information submitted it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would constitute sustainable development and not put undue pressure on emergency services, contrary to paragraph 163 of the NPPF (2019), Policy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), and in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O.2 (1) (c) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order (England) 2015 (as amended)",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house. The original footprint shows two outriggers, possibly a coal shed/toilet. The property history available online shows that a previous application 21/00555/PAEXT dated 09.04.2021  was also refused for this reason. The outriggers create side elevations. The proposed extension would therefore extend beyond the side elevation of the original footprint and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "If you have evidence to contradict the local planning authority's assessment of the application, you are encouraged to apply for the development again and include that evidence in support of the application.",
