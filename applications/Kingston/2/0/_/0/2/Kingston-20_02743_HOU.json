    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its excessive scale and siting, would dominate and unabalance the pair of semi-detached properties at Nos. 40-42 Manor Way, thereby resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The RBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has raised an objection and provided a comment in response to the submitted details:\r\rThe applicant has submitted 2 plans for site access 2023/7536/001 & 2023/7536/002:\r- 2023/7536/001 - Shows access to the site where vehicles enter the site. This plan fails to take into account a parking bay situated right opposite the site which is over run in the tracking. The parking bays in question are not shown on the plan so does not reflect the situation on the ground.\r- 2023/7536/002 - Shows worst case scenario for larger vehicles. The tracking shows the vehicle clearly overrunning the footway. This is not acceptable under any circumstances as it poses a serious safety risk to pedestrians.\r\r-The applicant is to note that they should explore other measures to ensure no unsuspended parking, footway or traffic island on the road should be over run at any point during any proposed vehicular movements.\r- Except for the comments above the measures proposed in the remaining document seem to be acceptable. However, a resubmitted document will be commented upon its own merits.\r\rWith the above comments, Highways would not support the discharge of condition 6 of application 23/01755/FUL in its current form.",
    "Please provide Existing and Proposed Loft Plans as there is window alteration in loft  at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works."
