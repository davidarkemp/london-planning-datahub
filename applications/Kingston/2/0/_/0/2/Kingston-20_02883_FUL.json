    "The proposed development is unacceptable within Flood Zone 3b and the submitted Flood Risk Assessment is inadequate, does not include a Sequential Assessment or a robust Exception Test or any details of flood plain storage compensation. As such, the scheme would put occupants at undue danger from flooding and would increase flood risk elsewhere contrary to Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2023)",
    "The proposed vehicular access and parking arrangements would have an unacceptable impact on highway safety to a heavily trafficked TFL Red Route, increasing road danger, and would likely exacerbate congestion in conflict with paragraph 115 of the NPPF (2023), Policies T3 and T4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By reason of its excessive bulk, cramped appearance within the site and poor quality design the proposed development would appear highly incongruous when viewed from the wider area and would harm the character and appearance of Beverley Way, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Guidance 2012.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that floor to ceiling heights would be sufficient, inadequate private and communal amenity space would be provided and it is unclear whether the flats and amenity spaces would receive sufficient daylight or sunlight. In the absence of any evidence to the contrary it is considered that the standard of accommodation would be poor, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy and the Residential Design SPD.",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the indicated biodiversity and habitat mitigations and enhancements could be delivered on site such that the development would deliver sufficient mitigations and enhancements, contrary to Policies G4, G6 and G7 of the London Plan (2021), Policies DM5, DM6, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 180 of the NPPF (2023).",
    "Insufficient private amenity space would be retained for the occupants of No. 66 Beverley  Way, a dwelling which is capable of family occupation, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation, contrary to the NPPF 2023, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 Kingston Core Strategy 2012 and the Kingston Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
