    "The proposed single storey rear extension would result in a significant loss of daylight to habitable room windows, an overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining No 8 Oakdene Drive by reason of its excessive depth and height along the shared boundary. The proposed development would result in a significant adverse impact on the amenities of adjoining properties contrary to Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The excessive depth of the proposal would be in conflict with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Desgin SPD and the proposed extension would not be proportionate or subordinate to the main dwelling.  It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposal contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012), the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "Any vehicular crossing must be constructed and any redundant crossing reinstated as footway in accordance with the provisions of the Highways Act, 1980 by the Service Director (Planning & Transportation) (Highways), Directorate of Environmental Services, Guildhall II, Kingston upon Thames.",
    "The submitted attic plan is not labelled as existing or proposed, please revise the attic plan with the correct labelling.",
    "Please provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
