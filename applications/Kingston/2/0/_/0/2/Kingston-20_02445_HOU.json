    "The submitted drawings are insufficient and therefore the proposal cannot be properly assessed. The application would not comply with article 7(1)(c)(ii) of the Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: This application seeks approval for a single storey rear extension (orangery) with a depth of 2.6m and a pitched height of 3.4m which would have eaves that sit at 2.4m. The proposed would sit closest to the boundary shared with neighbouring property No.54 Grafton Road. \r\rOfficers acknowledge the proposed extension would fall within the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33 and the design would be well-suited to the host dwelling, as it would respect the pitched roof format of the main roof and the proposed extension would not be incongruous to the wider area, as neighbouring properties benefit from similar extensions.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. Officers note that the extension would slightly breach the 45 Degree Rule in regard to the rear door of neighbouring property No.54 Grafton Road, however, the proposed material would aid in preserving their amenity in terms of sunlight and daylight. Additionally, No.54 Grafton Road, has an existing window that serves the same kitchen/dining area.\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
