    "No demolition or development, other than demolition to top of slab level, shall take place until a stage 1 written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, and the programme and methodology of site evaluation and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.\r\rIf heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 then for those  parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be  submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that  is included within the stage 2 WSI, no demolition/development shall take place  other than in accordance with the agreed stage 2 WSI which shall include: \rA. The statement of significance and research objectives, the  \rprogramme and methodology of site investigation and recording and  the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake  the agreed works \rB. Where appropriate, details of a programme for delivering related  positive public benefits. \rC. The programme for post-investigation assessment and  \rsubsequent analysis, publication & dissemination and deposition of  resulting material. this part of the condition shall not be discharged  until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the  \rprogramme set out in the stage 2 WSI. \r\rReason: This pre-commencement condition is necessary to safeguard the archaeological  interest on this site. Approval of the WSI before works begin on site provides  clarity on what investigations are required, and their timing in relation to the  development programme. If the applicant does not agree to this pre commencement condition please let us know their reasons and any alternatives  suggested. Without this pre-commencement condition being imposed the  application should be refused as it would not comply with NPPF paragraph 199.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey rear outbuilding -garden room\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding (garden room) would be approximately 3m high finished with a flat roof. Given the siting of the proposal and its proposed design and scale is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is noted that no trees would be removed as per submitted application form.  \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
