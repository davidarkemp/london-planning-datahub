    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form, other than the window frames which shall all be finished in timber, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) and Policy DM12 (Development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows in the south elevation and situated on the first floor shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises of a detached two-storey dwelling located to the west of Cherrywood Close, Kingston. \r\rThe site does not comprise of a listed building, nor is it located within a conservation area (although immediately borders onto the Liverpool Road Conservation Area boundary). \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks increase of the roof ridge to facilitate roof extension incorporating a side and rear dormer and 3no. rooflights to the front elevation and flat rooflights to flat roof sections. Solar panels to the flat roof section.\r\rPlanning History\rNone of relevance\r\rConsultation\r13no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\rKingston Town Conservation Area Advisory Committee: Objection. \"The site does not sit in a CA. However, the site does abut and is visible from the neighbouring Liverpool Road CA. In particular, the proposed increased roof height, addition of an incongruous new side dormer (to facilitate stairwell head room) and overly large new rear dormer, would not be in keeping with neighbouring properties and would cause harm to the setting of the CA.\"\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area and heritage assests; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rCouncil's Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for dormer extensions (under Policy Guidance 39), as follows:\r-\tSet down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm; \r-\tSet in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm; \r-\tDo not feature on the front slope of the roof (in most cases); \r-\tDesigned to complement the character of the existing house and wider area; \r-\tMatch or line-up with any original windows below; and, \r-\tNot built in the style of a mansard roof\r\rThe predominant roof form of the area is hipped, with a consistent eaves and ridge height to all of the dwellings within the small cul-de-sac of Cherrywood Close. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed additional height of 1.3m would significantly increase the height difference between the application dwelling and other neighbouring dwellinghouses.  \r\rThe scale of the proposed height difference would create a visually discordant relationship which is considered to harm the prevailing character of the street scene. \r\rThe proposed side dormer roof extension to one side of the roofslope is considered to be of a design that would appear incongruous within the roofscape as a projecting wing and when viewed in combination with the proposed roof height, would create a discordant, cluttered roof form to the host dwellinghouse which would be out of keeping with the character of the area.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 prescribes that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings\rshould also be actively managed. \r\rParagraph 199 of the NPPF 2021 sets out that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is\rirrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance\r\rParagraph 202 of the NPPF states that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the\rsignificance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use. \r\rThe special architectural and historic interest of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area can be summarised as an area of individually designed detached and semi-detached houses dating from the 1850s set in a mature landscape on the edge of Richmond Park.\r\rOfficers note that the roof of the application property is visible from Alexandra Road within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area. Officers consider the impact of the proposed roof extension would be less than substantial with the vista through to the roofscape of the application property seen as a glimpse in the Alexandra Road streetscene, over the top of a low-rise single-storey detached building (in use as a Kingdom Hall of Jehovah's Witnesses). \r\rAs per Paragraph 202 of the NPPF, 2021, there would be no mitigating public benefits associated with the proposal with only limited, private benefits afforded from the proposed roof extension.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposals would result in unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and wider street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers consider that the scale and siting of the proposals would be such that it would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light or outlook. In addition, it is considered that the proposals would not cause any greater impact upon the privacy amenity of either neighbouring dwelling than the existing first floor windows and nevertheless, use of conditions would adequately safeguard privacy.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and on the wider area. Officers consider that the proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the adjacent Liverpool Road Conservation Area.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and the application is therefore recommended for refusal. \r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Conditions 10 (Lighting) of planning permission  19/00991/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling. The site is located within the Riverside North Conservation Area.\r\rConsultation\r\rOne objection received and summarised as follows\r\rKTCAAC - Object on grounds of the proposals scale and mass and its harm to the character and appearance of the conservation area\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. \r\rParagraphs 189 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on designated and non designated heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated or non-designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extensions would be a subordinate addition and of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and their surroundings. The proposal whilst highly visible in the private and public views of the site would not be visually intrusive and would sit comfortably alongside the built form of the host property. It is not considered that the proposed development would harm any architectural features or mature landscaping which contribute towards the significance of the designated heritage asset.\r\rIt is considered the proposal would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the designated Riverside North Conservation Area that the proposal sits within. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light or overbearing appearance. \r\rIt is considered that whilst there may be some loss of light to the neighbouring properties but it is considered that the separation distance and orientation to the neighbouring properties to the proposed development are such that any loss of light would not cause undue harm to the existing living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rThe two windows proposed at the rear at the first floor of the proposed extension would serve a bathroom/wc and bedroom. It is acknowledged that these would have views towards the properties to the rear but it is not considered that this would be significantly greater than the views of the existing windows at the rear of the host property. However given that the bedroom window is a secondary habitable room window and a bathroom window it is reasonable to recommend a condition that these windows be obscure glazed to lessen the perceived impact on privacy of additional windows overlooking the neighbouring properties.   \r\rOther matters\r\rA condition is recommended to ensure the development is carried out in accordance with the deposited Fire Risk assessment in order for the development to accord with policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
