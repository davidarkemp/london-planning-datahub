    "The proposed extension would extend beyond  walls forming side elevations of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located within a residential cul-de-sac comprising, in the main, properties of a broadly similar style. \r\rNearby properties have had similar side and rear extensions and hip to gable roof extensions. \r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing rear conservatory, erection of single storey rear, first floor side extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 2nos front roof lights to facilitate loft conversion. Internal alteration.\r\rConsultation\rNo representations received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed extensions to the property would be in general accordance with the Development Plan and accompanying guidance, with the exception of the rear dormer, this would be an overly dominant addition, would fail to follow the original roof design of the property, and would result in a contrived roof form. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of the design, scale, size of the proposed roof dormer  It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy, subject to the imposition of conditions controlling the obscure glazing of the side window. \r\rFire safety - whilst no information has been submitted with regards to fire safety, I am content that this information could be submitted as part of a condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
