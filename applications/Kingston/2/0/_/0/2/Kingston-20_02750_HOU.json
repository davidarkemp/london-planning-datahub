    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The flat roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwellinghouse.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. 5 letters of objection have been received from 4 separate neighbouring properties relating to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r- Loss of Privacy\r- Overbearing Impact\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below\r\rRelevant Planning History\r21/01595/HOU - Demolition of existing conservatory. Erection of single storey rear extension and first floor side extension with associated changes to fenestration. Rear and side dormer roof extensions with chimney stack removal and installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion - Approved 23/12/2021\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant seeks planning permission for the addition of a patio with a height of approximately 610mm and a dwarf wall with a height of approximately 950mm. Officers have noted the concerns of neighbouring properties in regard to the height, bulk, design and layout of the retrospective patio. However, development of this type would not be incongruous in the vicinity of Branksome Way as several neighbouring properties benefit from rear patios. Furthermore, the raised patio would not be highly visible from neighbouring properties or the public highway.\r\rTherefore, the patio is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers acknowledge that the raised patio would afford views towards neighbouring No.12 Branksome Way and No.30 Woodlands Avenue. In order to mitigate any overlooking to neighbouring properties, officers will impose a condition, requiring the erection of privacy screening of 1.8m in height (when measured from the upper surface of the raised patio) along/adjacent to both sides of the raised patio. This would ensure no direct views towards these properties from the raised patio.\r\rWithin the context of the large rear facing windows which also serve the open plan kitchen/reception room at No. 12, the side facing window in proximity to the site boundary with the application site is considered to be a secondary window. While there would be some loss of daylight and outlook as a result of the necessary privacy screens at the application site, it is, on balance, considered that sufficient outlook and daylight would be retained for this habitable room as a whole via the south and rear facing windows which provide the primary outlook over the rear garden and source of daylight. Therefore, subject to the erection of privacy screens, it is considered that the patio would not give raise to any significant adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
