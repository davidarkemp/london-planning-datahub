    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) the premises shall only be used as a single family dwelling and for no other purpose (including any other purpose in Class C3 on the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 or any provision equivalent to that Class in any Statutory Instrument revoking and/or re-enacting that Order).\r\rReason: The establishment of purposes or uses other than a single family dwelling would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and would provide an unsatisfactory standard of accommodation for future occupiers and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship with the nearby residential uses in accordance Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

    "Condition 5 (Refuse/Recycling) of planning permission 18/12924/FUL states:\rRefuse/Recycling\r(i) No building or use hereby permitted shall be occupied or the use commenced until the refuse store, and area/facilities allocated for storing of recyclable materials, as shown on approved plan no(s) 3852/PL/210A have been completed in accordance with\rthe approved plans. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development shall either be stored within this dedicated store/area as shown on the\rapproved plans, or internally within the building(s) that form part of the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material shall be stored or placed for collection on the public highway or pavement, except on the day of collection.\r(ii) Prior to occupation of the development hereby approved, details of the waste collection strategy (to include details of the process for the collection of waste and recycling, the procedure for presenting waste and recycling for collection, and the size\rof waste and recycling bins) shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by\rthe Local Planning Authority.\rRefuse storage facilities and recycling facilities shall thereafter be provided in accordance with the approved details, such facilities to be permanently retained at the site. The development shall be maintained in accordance with the approved waste\rcollection strategy.\r\rOfficer comment:\rThe approved development included three separate refuse stores internally at ground floor level. Two providing refuse and recycling storage for the development itself (one residential and one commercial), and one to provide a store for the existing bins that are left on the access road and serve the Kingston Hill properties (with capacity to match the existing). The officers report  welcomes the provision of the additional store for the use of existing properties, and acknowledges that the developers are not in a position to require that the commercial units in Kingston Hill use the refuse facilities offered. The application proposal advised that a site management company would be appointed who would be responsible for the transfer of refuse/recycling bins from the site to Manorgate Road on collection day.\r\r1003-T-01 RevP2 - Refuse Collection Plan is submitted with this proposal. It details  the two  refuse stores for the development itself (one residential and one commercial), with capacity in accordance with the Council's Joint Recycling and Waste Technical Planning Guidance.  It details that bins would be brought to a holding area near the site entrance on collection day and returned the same day by the block managers. The plan also includes the provision of the additional refuse store for the use of Kingston Hill properties, as per the consented layout.\r\rOn this basis, officers are satisfied that the refuse and recycling storage arrangement are acceptable and  condition 5 can be discharged.",
