    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Broadmead Avenue.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of two storey side extension and rear dormer extension, in association with conversion of roofspace into habitable space and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roof slope. \r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\rOfficer response: The above concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed two storey side extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as the proposed roof would not be set down by recommend 500mm as it would match the existing roof line. It is noted that the proposed side extension would be set in from the common boundary by recommended 1m to maintain the existing gaps between the buildings and that the first floor extension would be set back from the front elevation.\r\rThe existing cat-slide feature would be retained, in accordance with Policy Guidance 37  of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rOfficers note that the existing street scene shows various examples of the two storey side extensions, similar to the proposal. Therefore it is considered that due the proposed design and materials, siting and scale of the proposed two storey side extension, it would not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. As such, the proposed two storey side extension would appear in-keeping with the host dwelling and surrounding area. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would not be set down from the roof ridge, however considering its modest scale and proposed set in distances from the sides, is is considered to appear as proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rThe alterations to the roof of the existing single storey rear extensions are noted and are acceptable. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised regarding the proposed rear dormer roof extension. However given the separation distance of approximately 30m from the existing rear elevation of the host dwelling to the rear elevations of the adjoining properties to the rear, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an undue overlooking or an unacceptable loss of privacy in relation to these properties.\r\rTo ensure no unacceptable impact of the proposed openings to the side elevation at the first food level to the adjoining property a relevant condition regarding obscure glazing and fixed windows would be added. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar/Cycle Parking\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposal would not affect the existing car or cycle parking facilities. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rWestfield Court is a four-storey flatted block fronting Portsmouth Road. \r\rThe building is located on the Riverside South Conservation Area and the Thameside Strategic Area of Special Character. The building is not statutory or locally listed. \r\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the replacement of single glazed wooden windows and patio doors with UPVC double glazed windows/doors\r\rConsultation\rNo representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact on heritage assets; \r- Fire safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals involve the installation of 8no. replacement UPVC sash windows to the northern, southern and eastern elevations. The proposed windows would be uPVC but of a high quality and in a style matching closely with the existing timber sash windows to be replaced.\r\rThe proposed changes are considered acceptable in terms of their design and would result in minimal impact on the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and wider streetscene.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe replacement sashes would closely replicate those which exist currently in design and appearance. The proposed replacement sash window frames would not appear visually obtrusive when viewed from the street scene. The glazing bars and window pane sizes would correspond with that which currently exists. On the whole, it is considered that the proposals would not constitute a harmful addition to detrimentally affect, nor result in harm to, designated Riverside South Conservation Area and Thames Side Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not have any harmful impact upon the significance of the designated heritage assets of either the Riverside South Conservation Area or the Thames Side Area of Special Character.  \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that listed building consent should be granted.\r",
