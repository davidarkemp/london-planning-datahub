    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service.

The proposed development is not considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed dormers would not be a subordinate addition or of an archtectural style sypmapthetic to the host property. Cumulatively they would create visual clutter at roof level and it is considered the proposal would be an incongruous addition to the host property that would not site comfortably within the existing roof form or the built form of the host property overall. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. The porposal would reduce the amount of private amenity on site but this would not be reduced by more than 50% and it is considered that the remaining amenity space would still be of a practical layout and usable as private amenity space for the host property.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters \rA condition is recommended to secure the submission of fire saftey strategy to ensure the proposed development would comply with policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r\rNo response received\r\rRelevant History \r\r23/00974/HOU - Erection of first floor side extension with alterations to the existing roof, and erection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 3no. rooflights to the front roof slope to facilitate loft conversion - Refused\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed scheme is a revision of planning application 23/00974/HOU. The proposal does not fully follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted Residential Design SPD. Whilst the scheme proposed has on the 1st floor side extension provided at least a 500mm set back from the front elevation and 500mm set down from the ridge the propoesed 1st floor extension would still extend across to the boundary.  \r\rAs such officer's concerns still remain that the proposed extension at 1st floor would still not be a subordinate addition to the host property with its width extending to the side boundary still cause for concern. It is considered the proposal would unduly unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties which the host property forms part of and in turn would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, the pair of semi-detached properties the host property forms part of and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed 1st floor extension's proximity to the side boundary would create a dominant and overbearing addition to the host property despite the proposed set down from the ridge and set back from the front elevation. It is considered that the extension at 1st floor would still be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring properties eroding the spaciousness of the plot and still create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the rear of the properties in particular 125 South Lane to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rThe application is supported by a daylight/sunlight survey. Whilst the survey concludes there would be some loss of light to the neighbouring occupiers the levels of light do not fall below what is considered acceptable by the BRE Guidance. As such it is considered that the applicant has demonstrated that the proposal would on balance not have an adverse impact on the neighbouring occupiers provision of daylight sunlight. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure and due to the orientation and proximity of the neighbouring properties in relation to the proposed extensions it is considered that this would also impact upon and reduce the outlook of neighbouring occupiers in particular 125 South Lane to the detriment of their existing living conditions.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r",
    "PREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY:\rApplication reference 21/01375/FUL - Change of use from former hall to 4no. dwellinghouses with associated parking, amenity space, refuse/recycling facilities and landscaping. Granted planning permission, dated 23.09.2021.\r\rApplication reference 22/01411/CLC - Details required for Conditions 3 (Materials), 4 (Construction Management Plan), 5 (Refuse), 6 (Boundaries), 7 (Levels), 11 (Sustainability), 14 (Cycle Parking) and 23 (Bat Survey) of planning permission 21/01375/FUL (Erection of 4no. dwellinghouses with associated parking, amenity space, refuse/recycling facilities and landscaping). Approved, dated 27.07.2022.\r\rApplication reference 23/01449/CLC - Details required for Condition 8 (Landscaping Scheme), Condition 12 (Drainage System) and Condition 20 (Nature Conservation) of planning permission 21/01375/FUL (Erection of 4no. dwellinghouses with associated parking, amenity space, refuse/recycling facilities and landscaping). Refused, dated 25.07.2023.\r\rApplication reference 23/02134/CLC - Details required for Condition 8 (landscaping scheme), 12 (drainage), and 20 (nature conservation) of 21/01375/FUL (Erection of 4no. dwellinghouses with associated parking, amenity space, refuse/recycling facilities and landscaping). Pending Consideration.\r\rCONSULTATIONS:\r23no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. 1no. representation received, objecting to the proposals. Concerns summarised as follows:\r-\tPotential for overlooking from proposed side windows.\r\rOfficer's comment: Duly noted. The proposed side windows would be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m, and so, therefore, would not introduce the opportunity for overlooking towards neighbouring properties. Please refer to main body for full assessment.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe site is located on the western side of Leatherhead Road. The site is a previously developed or brownfield parcel of land, which formerly accommodated a community hall structure (since largely demolished - some structures remain) and previously allotments (since disused). The land is currently overgrown and is not used for any purpose.\r\rBarwell Business Park is located on the opposite side of Leatherhead Road to the site, which comprises of a linear form of two-storey brick-built offices. The site is bounded to the rear by the open space of Sir Francis Baker Recreation Ground and Chessington Cricket Club. Four detached properties lie adjacent to the north fronting Leatherhead Road and two semi-detached chalet-style properties fronting Leatherhead Road lie adjacent to the south of the site, with those properties along Almshouse Lane backing onto the subject site.\r\rThe site is located within designated Green Belt. The site does not contain any listed or locally listed buildings, nor is it located within a Conservation Area.\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) rating of 2. The site lies within the Environment Agency's Flood Zone 1.\r\rPROPOSAL\rApplication under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plan) of Planning permission 21/01375/FUL (Erection of 4no. dwelling houses with associated parking, amenity space, refuse/recycling facilities and landscaping) to add new windows in the side elevation.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development, impact upon character and appearance and impact upon neighbouring residential amenity.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission.\r\rIt is acknowledged that there is no statutory definition of a minor material amendment (MMA) although the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) explains that a MMA is 'likely to include any amendment where its scale and/or nature results in a development which is not substantially different from the one which has been approved'.\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed changes submitted under this application to the approved permission comprise of the addition of windows to the side elevation. One additional obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m (above floor level) window is proposed to the first floor to the south flank elevation and one additional obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m (above floor level)  window is proposed to the ground floor on the north flank elevation. The windows would serve a first floor hallway and ground floor utility/wc. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the building and wider area. \r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Residential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed changes would not create any material loss of amenity or privacy beyond that assessed under the original application given that the windows would be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m (above floor level). Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed amendments to Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission reference 21/01375/FUL are considered to maintain appropriate good quality design and would not result in material difference or material harm in terms of character and appearance of the proposed development, nor in terms of impacts upon neighbouring amenity. The proposals are considered to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.  \r\rRECOMMENDATION\rGrant planning permission.\r",
