    "The proposed change of use of ancillary residential garden land and garage to a storage and distribution (Class B8) use, and the associated operations and paraphernalia associated with that use, would be visually incongruous and completely out of character with the suburban residential character of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The application site has poor accessibility by public transport and would likely increase of the use of the car as a mode of transport and would therefore fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent evidence and complete information, that the proposed development would not adversely impact on-street car parking capacity which could harm the amenities of neighbouring properties and adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 109 of the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposed storage and distribution use (Class B8) in this suburban location would be visually intrusive and result in unacceptable noise and disturbance to neighbouring properties through the introduction of a more commercial and intensive use to this residential area contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans/documents submitted for the purposes of this application are consistent with the parent planning permission reference 20/02942/FUL, however, any inconsistencies would be resolved in favour of the parent permission. An Application for Approval of Details Reserved by Condition should not be used to evolve or modify the scheme in a way that is substantially different from that set out in the application.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 30 (Damage Costs Assessment) and Condition 56 (Air Quality Neutral Assessment) of planning permission 21/04022/FUL, which states:\r\rCondition 30 (Damage Costs Assessment) - Prior to commencement of above ground works on the development hereby permitted, a Damage Cost Assessment in line with the requirements of the GLA Sustainable Design and Construction Practice must be submitted to and approved in writing by the local authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the health of neighbouring properties and future residents in the interests of air quality as set out in Policy SI 1 (Improving air quality) of the London Plan.\r\rCondition 56 (Air Quality Neutral Assessment) - Air Quality Neutral Assessment: A Damage Cost Assessment using the most up to date damage cost toolkit from Defra and the most recent version of the EFT must be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority within 3 months of commencement of development.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy SI 1 (Improving air quality) of the London Plan 2021 and the GLA Sustainable Design and Construction Practice SPG.",
    "Please revise the red outline in the location plan. The red outline needs to include access from the main road/highway.",
    "The submitted existing site block plan has an incorrect scale bar, it measures to 125m instead of 50m in scale 1:1250 as stated. Please provide a Existing Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r",
