    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The existing ridge tiles shall either be maintained in their current location and condition or otherwise reinstated prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates. \r\rReason: To prevent harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, in accordance with policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the north-east or south-west elevations of the dwelling to which this permission relates unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The rooflights in the development to which this permission relates shall be of a conservation style, constructed in timber and set flush with the plane of the roof in which they are inserted. The rooflights shall be permanently retained in this style. \r\rReason: To prevent harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, in accordance with policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the north-east or south-west elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, any new or replacement windows in the front elevation of the dwelling shall be timber framed and painted white.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 23/00168/HOU:\r- to remove 2nos rooflights in rear extension\r- provision of planted wildflower extensive green roof\r- change in parapet height\r- relocation of ASHP\r- updates to fenestration.\r\rWhilst the proposed changes might be considered acceptable in terms of their design and impact on neighbouring properties, the question Officers must turn their mind to is, are the proposed changes material or non-material. It is clear from the drawings that the change in this case would be highly noticeable, resulting in a development with a significantly different rear elevation, as such the amendments would represent a material change. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the application be refused.\r\rThe applicant is advised to submit an application under s73 or a new householder planning application.",
    "No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time. Should the applicant wish to install scaffolding or a hoarding on the footway whilst undertaking this work, separate licences may be required with TfL, please see, https://www.tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-andconstruction/highway-licences.",
    "Transport for London Comment: The site of the proposed crossover is on Malden Way, which forms part of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). TfL is the highway authority for the TLRN, and is therefore concerned about any proposal which may affect the performance and/or safety of the TLRN. \r\rIt is understood that the applicant is proposing the extension of an existing crossover.\r\rIt is understood from the plans that vehicles will be able to enter and exit in a forward gear.\r\rThe applicant will need to enter into a Section 278 (Section278Team1@tfl.gov.uk) agreement with TfL for works to the footway or highway. It should be noted that TfL will have to approve and agree any amendments to the highway and all costs must be covered by the applicant.\r\rTfL is satisfied that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on the TLRN.",
    "Officer Report\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rConversion of garage into utility room and changes to fenestration\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the existing car parking facilities; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed conversion of garage would include an erection of a new roof and front porch with associated alterations to fenestration. Considering the scale of the proposal, the proposed design and materials to match the existing ones, it is considered that the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers note the existing street scene contains examples of similar front extensions, as such it is considered that the proposal would not have significant impact on Gainsborough Road.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Condition 5 (Fire Safety Strategy) of planning permission 22/03034/HOU states:\r\rPrior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r \rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r \rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rOfficers response: The submitted Fire Safety Strategy is considered to be sufficient. As such, condition  5 is hereby approved. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved strategy and thereafter maintained.",
