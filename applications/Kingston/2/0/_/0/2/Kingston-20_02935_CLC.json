    "The submitted details are unacceptable and show an incorrect layout in comparison to that approved under planning permission 18/12924/FUL. As such the proposed development would not be in the interests of visual amenity, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted 2012.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed and are hereby approved, subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details (Corum Brick), in relation to Condition 5 (Material samples) of Planning Permission 21/03204/FUL, which states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of any development above ground level, samples of the facing brick to be utilised in the development (Units 8 / 9 as shown on Proposed Site Plan - Drawing Number C-233-TP-02 Rev L), shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer comments: The submitted Vandersanden corum brick is a buff brick of reasonably good quality which is considered compatible with the mix of brick evident along Red Lion Road and consistent with the visuals provided as part of the parent planning permission.",
