    "By reason of the proposed depth of the extension, its lack of separation distance from the shared boundaries and the position of principal neighbouring habitable room windows at ground floor level, it is considered that the proposed development would be unneighbourly and would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.  The proposed development would fail BRE Guidance in relation to the 45 degree rule and result in an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of light, would create an undue sense of enclosure and would result in a loss of outlook to both Nos. 60 and 64 Douglas Road. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant is advised to seek planning permission through a householder application, after assessing the proposal against the guidelines set out under the council's Residential Design SPD.",
