    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rThe site is located in the Local Area of Special Character Lime Grove (non designated heritage asset)\r\rConsultation \r\r20 objections have been received and are summarised as follows\r\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Effects on trees\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rAssessment\r\rThe proposal would provide an increased residential offer on the site providing 3 x 3 bed and 1 x 1 bed units a net increase of 3 residential units which would contribute towards the boroughs year on year housing targets in the absence of a 5 year housing supply. \r\rThe proposed units would meet the London Plan internal space standards and would be of a practical layout meeting the requirements of London Plan policy D6. \r\rThe proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties due to its size, siting and design orientation and dsitances from neighbouring properties are such it is considered that the proposed development would not have an undue impact on the neighbouring occupiers existing living conditions in regards to outlook and daylight/sunlight. However offficers are concerned that the rear balconies on the upper floors would lead to actual or perceived overlooking of the neighbouring occupiers in particular the gardens of 18 Acacia Grove and as such result in a loss of privacy to the neighbouring occupiers which would cause harm to the residential amenities of the neighbouring ocupiers and diminsih their existing living conditions.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed building by virtue of its size siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the streetscene. It is considered that the proposed building would sit uncomfortably in the street and would not be of an architectural style sympathetic to its surroundings and would detract from the character and appearance of and cause less than substantial harm to the non designated heritage asset the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character. It is considered that the proportions and arrangement of the building do not present a coherent design and there is overexcessive use of balconies at the rear which are considered to be an incongruous feature and creates visual clutter and detracts from the character and appearance of the area. In addition the dormer at the rear also appears to sit uncomfortably within the context of the proposed building and its surroundings and added to the stepping of the building at the rear gives the building an unbalanced appearance at the rear.\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide sufficient off street parking and would not increase  exacerbate existing on street parking demand and in the absence of a signed and completed legal agreement for a car free development to mitigate demand for on street parking or evidenced through a parking beat survey that on street parking capacity exists the proposal has the potential to create congestion and parking pressure that could prejudice highway safety and the proposal would therefore not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF and policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r\rThe LPA's tree and landscape officer does not raise an objection to the proposal and it is considered that the proposal would not cause harm to respect to trees. It is proposed that the lime tree at the front is removed as it conflicts with the proposed development. Given the condition of the tree no no objections to its loss are raised. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
