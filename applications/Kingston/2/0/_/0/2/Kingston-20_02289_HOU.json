    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within Flood Zone 2.\r\rConsultations\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Flood Risk.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: WhiLst officer acknowledge that the proposed first floor extension is not a common type of development in the vicinity of Thornhill Road, the extensions would relate well to the host property and it would not be visible from the streetscene. The applicant proposes to use matching materials, preventing a stark difference from the host dwelling and officers note that the proposed development would generally be designed to respect the character of the original dwelling with the proposed pitched roof, as such would appear as a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. \r\rOverall, there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and it is would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has sufficiently demonstrated the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed first floor rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rules and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting and modest size of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r  \rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site and Surroundings\r\rThe application site is a detached residential dwelling located to south of Wilton Grove, New Malden.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. \r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area and the building and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified with no responses received. \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\rDesign \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rFire Strategy\r\rDesign \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers Comment: \rThe proposed single storey rear extension replaces an existing conservatory and extends the full width of the dwelling to a depth of approximately 3.9m and a height of approximately 3m. This extension is considered appropriate in design and proportionate in scale to the host dwelling. The materials comprise a mix of render walls and black aluminium panels to the rear elevation. \r\rA new roof is proposed to the existing side extension. The roof would be raised to a modest degree but this is not considered to result in any design concerns and the additional height would not be visible behind the existing parapet. \r\rThe existing garage door is to be replaced by a window. This new opening is considered compatible with the existing dwelling and raises no design concerns. \r\rFor these reasons, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: \rThe site is adjoined by 5 Wilton Grove to the east and 7 Wilton Grove to the west.\r\rWith regard to 5 Wilton Grove, the proposed single storey extension does not extend beyond the existing conservatory but has a flat roof and is higher at the neighbour boundary (3m) than the conservatory (approximately 2.3m). Given the modest depth and additional height, the proposal is not considered to be overbearing for this neighbour. \r\rWith regard to No. 7 Wilton Grove, this neighbour has an existing outbuilding sited on the boundary of the application site and so, for this reason, as well as the reasonable height and depth of the extension, the ground floor extension is not considered overbearing for this neighbour. The same conclusion is reached for the new roof of the side extension which raises the building by approximately 0.2m.\r\rBased on the submitted drawings, officers have undertaken a 45 degree elevation test which demonstrates that the proposal would not interrupt the midpoint of the nearest habitable window to either neighbour. It can therefore be concluded that the proposal would not result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to neighbours. \r\rThe proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for either adjoining neighbour.\r\rIn summary, the proposal is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and the proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rHighways\r\rThe existing garage is to be alrered to a garage/storage. It is unclear whether any off street parking is being lost. However, regardless, the existing dwelling benefits from a large forecourt parking area. On this basis, there is considered adequate space remaining on site for parking to avoid an unacceptable impact on highway safety. \r\rSummary\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
    "This is for a deed of variation to amend a legal agreement attached to planning permission 08/16113/OUT. \r\rThe Deed of Variation only amends the mortgagee's indemnity clause and does not contain any substantive amendments to the previous legal agreement. The Council's legal team has advised that the clause is now fairly standard and acceptable to lenders. Such requests are fairly common as the previous format has resulted in Registered Social Landlords having difficulty in finding funding.\r\rFor these reasons, the Deed of Variation is considered acceptable.",
