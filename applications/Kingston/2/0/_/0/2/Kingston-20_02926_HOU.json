    "The proposed development would result in loss of characteristic feature (undercroft) and therefore would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the adjoining terraced dwellings resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed works would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the surrounding trees. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to comply with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
