    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rRelevant history\r\r23/00512/HOU Erection of first floor side and rear extension. Refused \r\rReasons\r1.The proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring gardens and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r2.The proposed extension by virtue of their size, siting and design would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and narrow their outlook to detriment of their existing living conditions. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r22/01542/HOU Erection of part single, double-storey rear and side extensions. Removal of 1no chimney stack, new porch and associated changes to fenestration. Refused \rReasons:\r1. By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling, within the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \r\r2. By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.11 Romney Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No.11 Romney Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r22/03168/HOU Erection of a part single, part two storey side and rear extension and new porch. Refused \rReasons:\r1. By reason of its overall design, height, scale, bulk and massing, the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling and would not be set-in from the shared site boundary by a minimum of 1 metre in conflict with Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would fail to retain characteristic gaps between houses and would be out of keeping with the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \r2. By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.11 Romney Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at No.11 Romney Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConsultation\r\r8 responses received. 5 in support and 3 in objection to the proposed development. The objections are summarised as follows\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rThe proposed extensions are a revision of the previous proposals listed in the relevant history section above and notably the most recent 23/00512/HOU. The depth of the extension has been reduced by 1m and the extensions have been set off the boundary to the side but would still be within 1 metre of the boundary at the side. \r\rIt considered that the revised proposed development would still be of an excessive depth at first floor to the rear. It is considered that the proposed extensions proximity to the side boundary would still be of concern with less than a 1metre gap between the side elevation and the side boundary.  It is considered that the proposal would still fill up the plot to the side and reduce the spaciousness between the adjacent plot particularly at 1st floor level. The proposals would still not be a subordinate addition or of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property and would not follow the guiding principles of the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design Guide. \r\rIt is considerd that the proposed extensions by virtue of their size, siting and design would still create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be a dominant and overbearing feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the neighbouring gardens and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would result in some loss of light to neighbouring occupiers but this is not considered significant enough to merit a reason for refusal. The proposed extensions due to their proximity to the boundary and excessive depth would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring occupiers and would narrow the outlook of neighbouring occupiers as a result to the detriment and harm of their existing living conditions. It is not considered the proposal would result in a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be not in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rThe applicant is advised to seek pre-app advise to discuss potential amendments to the scheme. \r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
