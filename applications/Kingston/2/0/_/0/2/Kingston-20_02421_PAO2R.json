    "The applicant has failed to provide any evidence to support the existing/vacant use as being B1(a) office and as such the LPA is not satisfied that the proposed change of use from office to residential would fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would have sufficient provision of off street parking and would not lead to on street parking pressures and congestion that could prejudice highway safety and as such the proposed change of use from office to residential would not fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "The key areas of assessment are:\rThe impact of the development on character and appearance;\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\rThe impact of the development on highways; and,\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets.\rThe impact of the development on trees.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The  development as built is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there is no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  As with the consented scheme, the proposed garage would be built on the boundary with the neighbouring properties at No.s 1-4 Fairlawn. Whilst the proposed development may cause some level of overshadowing of No. 4's, forecourt it would not adversely impact any principal habitable room windows to an unacceptable degree. It is considered that the development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light, overbearing appearance or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies\rT6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan in order to not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rOfficers Comments: The original application of which this is a resubmission of was refused on the grounds that the proposed development would result in an over provision of car parking on site that would fail to promote sustainable modes of transport.\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 2 (poor). In accordance with Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021, Outer London properties in locations which have PTAL Levels of 2 - 3 and have three or more bedrooms, should be limited to 1 car parking space per dwelling.  As with the consented scheme, 2 parking spaces are provided,  1  within the garage, and one as part of the hardstanding.  \r\rParagraphs 198 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposal on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application site is situated within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area, which is a designated heritage asset. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: Large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course. \r\rOfficer Comment: As the proposed development is considered to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, officers therefore consider that the proposal would not harm the architectural and historic significance of the Coombe Wood Conservation Area. As no harm has been identified there is no need to weigh the scheme against any public benefits.\r\rThe Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill SASC constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the\rKingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough. As with the original consented scheme, Officers consider that the proposed construction of a boundary wall to the front of the property, as well as the garage would not appear visually incongruous within the streetscene. The proposed development therefore would not result in any harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\rThere would be no harm to the Area of Archaeological Significance as a result of the proposals.\r\rOfficers Comments: The consented garage was located within very close proximity to a plum tree located on the application site, and required the removal of this tree,  with a requirement for planting of a replacement  medium sized tree.\rThe applicant, as a keen gardener wished to retain the plum tree, resulting in the changes to the consented footprint of the scheme.  The works have been completed.   The Tree officer raises no objection to the proposal on the basis that the tree is to be retained. Therefore, there is no longer a  need for the replacement tree.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing rear conservatory and erection of part two storey/part single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. \rThree representations have been received from one address objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Inconsistencies with the submitted plans (incorrect numbers of the adjoining properties and siting of the existing neighbouring conservatory at the application site)\r\rOfficers response: The raised above concerns will be addressed within the report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed  rear extension to the first floor would be approximately 3.1-4.1m deep, the proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.6m. The extension would be finished with a dual pitched roof. \r\rPolicy Guidance 34 (two-storey rear extensions) states that the two storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling. The proposal would be set in from the common boundary with No 51 Norbiton Avenue by approximately 1m. The separation distance to No 55 Norbiton Avenue (semi detached dwelling) would be approximately 2.8m. While the separation distance to No 55 may be acceptable, the separation distance of approximately 1m to the boundary with No 51 is considered not appropriate and proportionate to the proposed scale of the extensions. Due to the proposed depth, mass and bulk, the proposal would appear as dominant and intrusive addition when viewed from the adjoining properties. \r\rWith regards to the proposed single storey rear extension, it would project approximately 5 - 5.8m beyond the original, staggered rear building line. The proposed flat roof would be approximately 3.4m high. It is noted that Policy Guidance 33 recommends depth of a rear extension up to 3.5m for semi-detached properties. \r\rDue to the siting of the proposal (almost on the common boundary with No 55), relatively narrow application site, small separation distances, the proposed rear extensions given their excessive depth, mass and bulk would appear as dominant and visually intrusive additions when viewed from the neighbouring properties. As such the proposal is not considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The main dwellings to consider when assessing the impacts on neighbouring amenity are Nos 51 and 55 Norbiton Avenue. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal due to its excessive depth, mass and bulk would appear as overbearing when viewed from the neighbouring properties and would result in an undue sense of enclosure to No. 55. \r\rOfficers note the 45 degree lines with regards to  the 1st floor rear extension and habitable opening at the adjoining properties at the first floor level on the submitted floor plans to demonstrate that the extension would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to both adjoining properties. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed single storey rear extension, its proposed height of approximately 3.4m and location of the nearest habitable opening at the ground floor level at No 55 (ref: 10/12364/LDP), it is considered that the proposal would fail the 45 degree rule and result in a significant loss of daylight in relation to this property. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "As the proposal does not include a vehicle crossover then please revise the Block Plan to remove this.\rNote: a Block Plan must be drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "Please provide the number of floodlights to be installed in the proposed site."
