    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling, located within Coombe Hill Conservation Area,  Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rConsultation\r- 10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received, relating to privacy.\r- Malden And Coombe CAAC -No objection\r- Trees And Landscape - No objection\r- Historic England (Archaeology) - Consulted \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on the Coombe Hill Conservation Area, the Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance or the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character. \r- The impact of the development on protected trees.\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter And Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:The proposed side extension would generally fall in line with the guidance of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 35 and taking into account the context of the large site and immediate neighbouring properties, there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rIn regards, to the proposed front canopy extension, officers note that it would appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition and would be designed to respect the symmetry of the existing front elevation. \r\rOverall, officers consider the proposed development to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Residential Design SPD states:\rFor all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use) the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distances will be but in general minimum separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained using the following standards:\r\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances (37)\r\rOfficers have assessed the proposed removal of the Holm Oak Tree (T2) and the Sycamore Tree (T3) in relation to the neighbouring property that is nearest to these trees. Although Mowbary, Kingston would be the closest neighbouring property to this tree, officers conclude there would be no significant loss of privacy to Mowbary, as the properties would still maintain a substantial separation distance of over 40m. It is also noted that replacement tree planting would be required following the removal of the trees (the final position of replacement tree planting would be agreed by way of planning condition).\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45  Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraph 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would reasonably adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD and would not be clearly visible from the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Coombe Hill Conservation Area, the Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance or the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rHistoric England (Archaeology) was consulted on this proposal, however, do not consider that it is necessary for this application to be notified to them, as the proposal would not fall within the following catergories:\r\r- Major planning applications over 0.5 hectares whether in an APA or not\r- Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping requests and Environmental Statements\r- Applications supported by an archaeological desk-based assessment\r- Minor planning applications in any APA (tiers 1 to 3)\r- Domestic basement applications in APA tiers 1 and 2 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers consult GLAAS on any domestic basement in an APA.\r- Householder and equivalent-scale very minor applications in APA tier 1 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers do not consult GLAAS on householder or equivalent applications unless within 50m of a scheduled monument.\r- Proposed substantial demolition or major alterations to historic buildings\r- Submission of details in relation to archaeological conditions\r- Appeals on applications for which an archaeological issue has previously been identified\r\rAs such, no comment would be required from Historic England (Archaeology).\r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) states that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted an Arboricultural Impact Assessment which was assessed by the Council's Tree & Landscape Officer.\r\rThe Tree and Landscape Officer comments as follows:\"The trees proposed for removal in order to facilitate the development are protected by the Conservation Area (not the TPO), but they are small trees providing no public amenity. On this basis, There is no objection to their removal if replacement planting can be secured of 2 for 1 via a detailed landscape and planting plan. The trees do not have to be immediately to the same location but can be elsewhere within the property the plan should include detail of species and size at the time of planting and the planting should be undertaken in Oct 2023 and not before.\"\r\rWhilst there was no objection to the proposed removal of the Holm Oak Tree (T2) and the Sycamore Tree (T3), a detailed landscape and planting plan is required and will be secured by condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
