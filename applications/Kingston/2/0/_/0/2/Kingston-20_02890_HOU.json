    "The proposed vehicular access by virtue of its siting would encroach within the 10 metre junction protection area for the junction with Elmdene as detailed in the RBK Crossover Policy 2020 and this close proximity to the junction of Elmdene is considered to present a highway safety risk that could result in conflict between vehicles using the proposed access and the junction of Elmdene which is likely to prejudice highway safety. The proposal would therefore not accord with paragraph 109 of the NPPF and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy and the RBK Crossover Policy 2020.",
    "The application site is located on the pavement of Maple Road adjacent the St Andrew's Square Gardens. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The site is located in the designated St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. The immediate surrounding buildings and curtilage/land are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\r140 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposed telecoms apparatus.\r9 responses in support have been received. \r\rSurbiton CAAC - Objection raised siting and appearance \rVictorian Society - Objection raised siting and appearance \rLondon Parks and Gardens Trust - objection raised siting and appearance\r\rLPA's Tree and Landscape Officer - reviewed proposals and raised no objection on tree grounds. \r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of 15m high 5G telecoms: H3G street pole and additional equipment cabinets\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) 1990 Act, the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 states in paragraph 117 states  Applications for electronic communications development (including applications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development Order) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development. This should include:\ra) the outcome of consultations with organisations with an interest in the proposed development, in particular with the relevant body where a mast is to be installed near a school or college, or within a statutory safeguarding zone surrounding an aerodrome, technical site or military explosives storage area; and\rb) for an addition to an existing mast or base station, a statement that self-certifies that the cumulative exposure, when operational, will not exceed International Commission guidelines on non-ionising radiation protection; or\rc) for a new mast or base station, evidence that the applicant has explored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or other structure\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location on the pavement of Maple Road adjacent the St Andrew's Square Gardens and opposite and adjacent to a number of residential properties.\r\rThe height of the mast would be 15m which would be in excess of 5 to 7m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed telecoms equipment would be sited in the designated heritage asset of the St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would provide the benefit of an improved telecoms offer in the area this benefit does not outweigh the disbenefit of the less than substantial harm caused by the proposal in its failure to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance of the telecoms apparatus would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with paragraphs 189 - 208 of the NPPF 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rHaving reviewed the applicants sequential approach to site selection officers are not satisfied that alternative sites have been thoroughly assessed with the reasons for discounting other sites seemingly lacking detail or fully reasoned and the site search being limited in its reach. Officers are not satisfied that the application site represents the least harmful option available in the area to meet the additional coverage and capacity requirements.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits.",
