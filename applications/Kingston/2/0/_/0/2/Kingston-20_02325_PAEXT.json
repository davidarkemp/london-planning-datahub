    "Land Contamination The Guiding Principles for dealing with Land Contamination is available on https://www.gov.uk/guidance/land-contamination-how-to-manage-the-risks. The Environment Agency recommends as best practice that all site desk study, site investigation, remediation strategies and verification reports submitted for planning purposes are undertaken by a suitably qualified person, preferably registered as a SILC/SQP. They recommend that for brownfield site developments - especially on sites with higher risk previous uses - desk study reports, site investigations, remedial strategies and verification reports are signed off under the National Land Quality Mark Scheme (NQMS). The NQMS is a system designed by the industry-led Land Forum to ensure that land contamination management work meets the necessary standards. It applies in particular to the presentation of environmental information to the regulator in the form of reports setting out both factual and interpretative information.\r",
