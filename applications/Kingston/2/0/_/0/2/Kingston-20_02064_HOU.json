    "The proposed single storey side extension would not be proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwelling and would erode the symmetry shared with the adjoining property. The excessive width and depth of the flat roofed extension along the boundary would appear overly dominant and incongruous within the street scene, contrary to the Residential Design SPD (2013) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Please clarify the application is only for side extension or wrap around side and rear extension. Please amend the application form, drawings and other documents accordingly.\r\r"
