    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous feature that would constitute a cramped form of development that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and have the appearance of being \"shoehorned\" into the site.  It would also erode the spaciousness of this corner plot and be out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area and as such detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, the proposal does not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

    " The applicant has failed to demonstrate in the absence of a supporting daylight/sunlight report/survey that the future occupants would have an adequate provision of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rNo response received to public consultations. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal does not fully follow the guiding principles of the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD however in the context of the site and its surroundings it isconsidered in this instance that the the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters \rA condition is recommeded to secure the development proposed is carried out in accordance with and thereafter maintained as such as per the deposited fire safety strategy statement prepared by Beaver Tech to ensure that the proposed development complies with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Proposal: \rVariation of Condition Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning permission 22/00304/FUL (Erection of two storey single family dwelling with roof accommodation and basement with associated amenity space, off street parking, perimeter wall, electric access gates, cycle storage and refuse/recycling store) to allow minor modifications on approved plans and elevations.\r\rPlanning History:\r\r22/00304/FUL - Demolition of existing house and erection of two storey single family dwelling with roof accommodation and basement - Granted 29 Mar 2022\r\rConsultations:\r15 no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. 1 objection was received making the following comments.\r-\tBuilding too large\r-\tParking issues\r\rSite and Surroundings:\rThe application relates to a site on the junction of Derwent Avenue and Grasmere Avenue, Kingston Vale.\r\rThe site was previously occupied by a two storey dwelling but this has since been demolished (through planning application 17/14763/FUL). \r\rThe site is within the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 1b (very poor) and is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability).\r\rProposal:\rVariation of Condition Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning permission 22/00304/FUL (Erection of two storey single family dwelling with roof accommodation and basement with associated amenity space, off street parking, perimeter wall, electric access gates, cycle storage and refuse/recycling store) to allow minor modifications on approved plans and elevations.\r\rAssessment:\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development, design, standard of accommodation, highways and traffic \r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rPlanning permission was recently granted for a two storey residential dwelling through 22/00304/FU. There are not considered to be any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission and the principle of development is therefore accepted. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal includes an extended basement, the introduction of a front porch, front gable and alterations to fenestration. \r\rThese are considered positive design changes that improve the appearance of the building in relation to the character and appearance of the area and Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rNew lightwells are proposed to serve the extended basement but these are modest in scale and unlikely to be prominent in public views. \r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rFor flats, Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD requires 10sqm of amenity space per dwelling + 1sqm per additional occupant and Policy Guidance 14 requires new flats to provide 50sqm of communal amenity space per development plus where less than 10sqm private amenity space is provided per flat, the shortfall in provision should be added to communal amenity space, e.g. If a private balcony of 3 sqm is added per flat, an additional 7sqm per flat should be added to the total amount of communal amenity space\r\rPolicy D12 of the London Plan requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rThe proposal increases the size of the basement but this remains for a media and games rooms which would not necessarily require high levels of daylight and sunlight. The main habitable rooms are on the ground and first floor which would continue to receive adequate levels of daylight and sunlight. \r\rOtherwise, the proposal does not introduce any changes that would diminish the standard of accommodation already approved through 22/00304/FUL.\r\rNeighbour amenity\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality. \r\rPolicy DM 10 of the Core Strategy requires development proposals to \"have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\".\r\rThe proposal would not raise any additional neighbour amenity concerns than those already considered through the previous permission. \r\rIn summary, the proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity to surrounding neighbours, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy. \r\rHighways and Traffic Impact\r\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Core Strategy requires new development to provide cycle parking in accordance with minimum standards.\r\rPolicy DM9 requires new developments to comply with car parking standards.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe proposal does not introduce any changes that would impact on the required level of parking or access to the site. Parking would remain at the front of the property, accessed from Derwent Avenue, and the new porch and front gable do not appear to significantly impact on the vehicular access or the ability of cars to manoeuvre on site. \r\rConclusion\r\rThe pre-existing building has been demolished and so, based on the existing vacant site, the proposal would result in an increase of 1 dwelling on site which would make a small, but nonetheless positive contribution to the Council's housing target which is afforded moderate weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe proposed development is broadly the same as previously approved and the proposed changes are considered acceptable. Overall the proposed development is considered acceptable by reason of its plot ratio, building line, scale, mass, design and materials and would not detract from the character of the area or the character or appearance of the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore consistent with Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021), policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance contained within the Residential Design SPD.  This is a neutral matter.\r\rThe proposed new dwelling is considered to represent an adequate standard of accommodation in accordance with Policy D6 and D12 of the London Plan and policies DM10 and DM 13 of the Core Strategy (2012). This is a neutral matter.\r\rThe proposed development is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours and, as such, is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012). This is a neutral matter.\r\rMatters relating to highways and transportation, refuse and recycling and sustainability are considered to be neutral matters, subject to conditions.\r\rGiven the lack of a 5 year housing land supply, the application is to be assessed on the tilted balance under the NPPF.
