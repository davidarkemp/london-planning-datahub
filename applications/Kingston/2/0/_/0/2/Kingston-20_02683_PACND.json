Therefore, the building does not benefit from the rights afforded by Class A of Part 20 of Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The building to which this application relates is less than three storeys in height above ground level. Therefore, the proposed development would fall foul of the limitations of Paragraph A.1(b) of Part 20 of Schedule 2 to The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would not be lawful.",
    "The building to which this application relates was constructed prior to 1 July 1948. Therefore, the proposed development would fall foul of the limitations of Paragraph A.1(c) of Part 20 of Schedule 2 to The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would not be lawful.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate whether the proposed development would comply with the limitations of Paragraph A.1(e) of Part 20 of Schedule 2 to The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling \r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History - 23/00556/HOU - Erection of part two storey/part single storey rear, first floor side extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3nos front roof lights to facilitate loft conversion. Refused 03.05.2023\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application (23/00556/HOU) which was refused for the following reasons:\r\r-By reason of its scale, width, insufficient set back, and insufficient set down, the proposed first floor side extension would not appear subordinate or proportionate the existing dwellinghouse, would be excessive in scale, would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene and would represent a cramped form of development which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r-By reason of the proposed gable ended design, the roof form would not relate well to the dwellinghouse or other properties on Reynolds Road which is characterised by hipped roofs, and would therefore be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIn comparison to the previous refusal,  the first floor side extension has been reduced in size; it would be set down from the ridge line by approximately 1.7m and has an increased distance from the shared boundary of approximately 750mm. Although officers acknowledge the setback from the front elevation has not been amended from the previously refused application. However,the proposed first floor would appear subordinate to the host dwelling and in the immediate vicinity of Reynolds Road.\r\rThe applicant has omitted the proposal for a dormer extension while retaining the double gable ends. Officers acknowledge that the gable ends may appear slightly bulky in the vicinity of Reynolds, it would not be incongruous in the wider area as a neighbouring property in Reynolds Road has benefited from a similar development. Additionally, the previous refusal states that the first floor extension and gable ends in conjunction would appear bulky. As the applicant has reduced the first-floor extension, the first floor and gable ends on balance, would be acceptable.\r\rIt is still noted that the double gable extension would not necessarily unbalance the attached dwelling No.20, as they are only connected via the closest ground floor extension on the boundary and it would not be appropriate when viewed in the context of the wider area of Reynolds Road, in regards to bulk. However, the proposed hip to gable ends could be erected under the provisions of permitted development, which is given considerable weight in this matter.\r\rAlthough the proposed porch would not maintain a 500mm distance from the existing bay window, it would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the existing dwelling. It would not significantly harm the current parking provisions and would not appear incongruous in the streetscene. \r\rThe proposed two storey rear extension would generally comply with the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD; it would relate well to the host property and would not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof and the proposal would maintain adequate separation distances between neighbouring properties. \r\rWhilst the ground floor rear extension would not mirror the host dwelling roof form, it is considered that the proposal would appear a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host building.\r\rOverall, on balance, officers consider that there would not be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers acknowledge there is an existing terrace at neighbouring property No.20 Reynolds, located on top of the single-storey rear extension which does not seem to benefit from planning permission. However, the amenity of the neighbouring properties in its entirety will be considered. \r\rAlthough the proposed two-storey rear extension would allow for further overlooking onto the existing terrace, it would not bring significant harm to the privacy of No. 20 Reynolds Road when compared to the existing situation.  \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety  \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement, however, the removal of this feature would not be odd in the immediate vicinity of Woodgate Avenue. Overall, this is considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its proximity in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not easily accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate replacement parking for vehicles.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total depth of 3.5m from the rear wall and a flat roof height of 3m. Although the depth would fall outside the guidance of the Residential Design SPD for semi-detached dwellings, it would not be visible from the streetscene, it would have a relatively modest height and the proposed material would be similar to the existing dwelling.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed side extension would be visible from the street and would not maintain 250mm distance from the boundary shared between neighbouring property No. 12 Lyndhurst Avenue, however, it would be reasonably small in scale and would appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling. Additionally, the extension would not be incongruous in the immediate vicinity of Lyndhurst Avenue as a number of dwellings benefit from side extensions.\r\rIn regards to the proposed front porch, officers consider it would not significantly affect the character and appearance of the original dwelling or the street generally. Although it would not respect the features of the adjoining property No.16 Lyndhurst Avenue, the proposal would respect the pitched roof form of the existing roof and would appear subordinate\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. Given that the proposed rear extension would be at a substantial distance from No.12 and only extend past No.16's rear extension by approximately 1.1m, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
