    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, C & G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site relates to Rokeby School, which is an all-boys school for ages 4 to 13 located on the south side of George Road. George Road runs east to west connecting Warren Road in the east to Kingston Hill. \r\rRokeby School is identified as a Locally Listed Building  and comprises a mixture of single, two and three-storey buildings. The original  three-storey school building  has been significantly extended over the years with single and two-storey extensions.\rThe road is mixed use in character,  with a number of non-residential uses including three schools accessed from George Road (Marymount International School, Rokeby School and Holy Cross Preparatory School). On the opposite side of the road is Four Acres, Unilever Training Centre. There are residential properties in Gatehouse Close to the south and The Drive to the west of the site.\r\rThis part of George Road is characterised by a mixture of large Victorian, Edwardian and 20th Century buildings. The buildings range in height from single to three- storeys and vary in design and appearance.\r\rThe site is within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area, a Strategic Area of Special Character, an Archaeological Area of Significance. \r\rThe trees on the site are covered by blanket Tree Preservation Order MAC.06.56A.7 and protected by the site's conservation area designation.\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 1 a (very poor) and is not well served by public transport\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey brick built electrical substation within north east corner of site.\rThe proposed electrical substation would be brick built with a flat green sedum roof, with a footprint of 4.4m x 5m and height of 2.5m from ground up to eaves level. \rThe existing pedestrian footway would be redirected around the substation. \rIt is advised that it is necessary to update the electrical supply into the school's kitchen as the school looks to replace gas fueled appliances with electrical ones.\r\rConsultation\rNeighbouring Occupiers: 3 Individual notification letters have been sent and the proposal has been advertised by site and press notice. No response has been received. \rHeritage Officer: No objection\rMalden and Coombe CAAC: No objection - Of similar character and materials to the proposals for the new classrooms above the sports hall. \rGreater London Archaeological Advisory Service: No objection. No conditions required.\rTree officer:No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Design and Heritage, including Archaeology\r-Trees; and,\r- Residential Amenity\r\rRelevant History\rThere is a concurrent planning application under consideration 23/01756/FUL for the Provision of three classrooms at first floor level above the existing sports hall(ensuring the ridge height remains unchanged) located on the eastern boundary together with the single storey extension of the existing Design and Technology classroom to the rear, new electrical substation and associated works. Capping pupil numbers to 420.  \r\rThis wider application also includes the substation subject to the current freestanding application 23/01788/FUL\r\rDesign and Heritage\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. \r                                                                                                                 \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe application site lies within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area, the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, and includes the locally listed building Rokeby School (Coombe Croft). It is also within a tier 2 archaeology area. \rOther designated heritage assets in the vicinity include: \u0019&¹ Four Acres and attached terrace, walls and steps, George Road (Grade II); \u0019&¹ The Lodge and Gatepiers at Four Acres, George Road (Grade II); \u0019&¹ Ivy Conduit House, George Road (Grade II); and \u0019&¹ Gallows Conduit House, George Road (Grade II*) \r\rOther non-designated heritage assets (locally listed buildings) include: \u0019&¹ Marymount School (Ballard Coombe); \u0019&¹ Boundary Wall Coombe Crest / Stonegarth; \u0019&¹ Robin Hill Cottage; \u0019&¹ Holy Cross Prep School (Coombe Ridge House); \u0019&¹ Holy Cross Convent School (Coombe Ridge House Lodge); and \u0019&¹ Hampton Spring \r\rThe submitted Heritage Assessment notes that the architectural and historic interest of the Coombe Wood conservation area primarily relates to the historic buildings within it which provide physical evidence as to the origins of the estate. A large number of these buildings are either statutorily or locally listed. These buildings are high quality and are of clear historic illustrative interest representing the tastes and fashions of their periods of construction.\r\rA large part of the character and significance of the conservation area relates to its suburban character and the large areas of open space, the golf course, surrounded by Victorian and early 20th century road layouts. The area of open space in conjunction with the mature gardens and well planted streets make a material contribution to the conservation area's character and appearance. \r\rIn terms of the impact of the proposal, the heritage assessment concludes that location of the sub station will mean that it would be discreet and the use of brick would mean it would blend in with the existing buildings.  \r\rOfficer Comment: The location of the substation at the front of  the school is largely screened from the key views of the locally listed Rokeby School (Coombe Croft) building on George Road due to the trees, landscaping and orientation of the buildings on site.  The substation is proposed as an addition to the northern side of the Sports Hall wing. This is to be clad in red brick to reflect the wider context, while reading as a separate structure. This is considered to have limited impacts on the heritage significance of relevant heritage assets.\r\rIt is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character and setting of the Coombe Wood Conservation Area, or the locally listed Rokeby School or other heritage assets as a result of the proposed development.\r\rArchaeology\rThe site is within a tier 2 archaeology priority area, Kingston APA 2.5 Coombe Hill\rOfficer comment: The Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service have assessed the proposal and confirm that the proposal is unlikely to have a significant effect on heritage assets of archaeological interest. No further assessment or conditions are therefore necessary\r\rTrees and Landscaping\rThe substation would be constructed on the site of an existing bin store which is currently tarmac. It is proposed that the electricity supply will come direct from George Road underneath the existing entrance road.\r\rAn Arboricultural Implications Report accompanies this proposal. It relates to the wider works to the school site but also reviews the works to the substation. Appendix 3 'Tree Protection Plan' shows the proposed route of the High Voltage Cabling and demonstrates that the proposed routing of the cables only marginally touches the outer edge of the root protection area of T26 Lime and T28 Yew. The Plan notes that within the RPAs excavation is to be carried out under arboricultural supervision.  \rThe Tree and Landscape Officer has confirmed that there are no objections to this proposal.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the size and siting of the proposed substation, it is considered that the proposed substation would not result in unacceptable harm to the amenity of neighbouring occupiers due to loss of light or outlook.  A Condition is recommended to limit noise emissions.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in compliance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
