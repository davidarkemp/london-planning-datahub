    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as '47 Caverleigh Way Worcester Park KT4 8DH', as set out in Section 1 (Site Address) of the submitted application form signed 22.10.2020, unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: the establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings in conflict with policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The flat roof area of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

The\rdevelopment shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples and completed prior to occupation.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the\rdevelopment in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012",
    "Please submit 'Structural Report' re land raising and retaining walls.",
    "After the site visit, it seems that the certain works are going on the area from the main entrance (access) to the plot 3 and 4, which are not included in the description of the proposal. Please submit all the works to be done in the proposed site.\r\rIt is the applicant/agent's duty to provide all the necessary works that are within the red outline of the location plan, even the applicant's do not own the land.\r\rCan you also confirm the works proposed in relation to the access to the site and that the red line includes all of these areas.\r"
