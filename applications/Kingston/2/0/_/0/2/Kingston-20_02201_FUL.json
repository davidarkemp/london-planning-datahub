    "The removal of condition 48 of application reference 19/01228/FUL would result in harmful levels of noise breaking into the affected flats which would result in poor quality accommodation, adversely affecting the amenities of the future occupiers of the development. Therefore, the proposal would be unacceptable and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.5 & 7.15 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012).",
    "The removal of condition 48 of application reference 19/01228/FUL would result in harmful levels of noise breaking into affected flats. This would leave the commercial use adjoining the application site vulnerable to noise complaints that may lead to unreasonable restrictions on the existing business and future occupiers, as well as undermine the viability of the site which falls within a Locally Significant Industrial Estate. The proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and in particular  paragraph 182, Policy 7.15 of the London Plan 2016 and D13 of the Intend to Publish London Plan.",

This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. The applicant is strongly advised to seek further advice before proceeding with any approval.",
