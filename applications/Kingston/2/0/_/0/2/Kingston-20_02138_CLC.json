    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a semi-detached family dwelling and it is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey side and rear extension\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side extension would replace the existing one and it would be of similar appearance. It is acknowledged that the proposed side extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would not be set back from the front elevation and not set in from the common boundary. However, considering the existing street scene, the existing side extension and the proposed scale and design of the replacement extension, it is considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be of a staggered rear building line and of the maximum depth of 6m along the boundary with No 50 Dysart Avenue. The proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.6m featuring a pitched roof. \r\rIt is noted that the proposed depth of the rear extension is not strictly with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, however due the size of the plot and the proposed design, the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest height of the proposed roof eaves of approximately 2.6m and the proposed roof design, it is considered that  the proposed development would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to both adjoining properties, therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight.\rDue to the proposed siting and the design of the extensions, the proposed development would also not result in an overbearing appearance or sense of enclosure. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Proposed Fire Safety Strategy 48DYS-P-03(-), which is considered acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
