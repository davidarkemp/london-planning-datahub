    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site is a two storey semi-detached residential dwelling located to the east of Mayfair Avenue, Worcester Park.\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability).\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified. No responses received. \r\rNetwork Rail: No objections.\rTfL: No comments \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rFire Strategy\r\rDesign \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rA single storey rear extension is proposed that is 4.7m in depth, spans practically the width of the property and is 3m in height. This extension is designed and scaled appropriately to the existing building. \r\rA two storey side extension is proposed that 2.7m in width, 7.5m in height and 6.1m in depth. The extension is set down from the ridge by 0.5m, set back from the front elevation by 0.35m and does not exceed half the width of the existing building. Whilst the side extension is only set back from the primary front elevation by 0.35m, the prominence of the catslide roof will be retained and it is accepted that there are numerous examples of first floor side extensions that are set back to the same degree (including 87 and 99 Mayfair Avenue). Whilst the extension will unbalance the adjoining the semi-detached property, it is accepted that the proposal broadly aligns with the guidance in the Residential Design SPD (other than the set back as discussed above) and there are various examples of similar side extensions in the surrounding area.\r\rA rear dormer is proposed that is set down from the ridge of the main building, in from the sides and up from the eaves. Whilst it is not set down 500mm from the ridge or in 500m from the adjoining neighbour boundary, it is accepted that there are other examples of similar dormer extensions in the surrounding area. \r\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: \rThe site has an existing conservatory which extends approx. 4.7m in depth, 3m in height and is set in from the neighbour boundary with No. 93 Mayfair Avenue. The proposed ground floor extension extends to approx. the same depth as the existing conservatory and extends to the neighbour boundary at a height of 3m. Given the extent of the existing conservatory, and as the height at the neighbour boundary is not unreasonable, the proposed ground floor extension is not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to this neighbour. \r\rThe proposed first floor extension extends along the boundary with No. 97 Mayfair Avenue but does not extend beyond the existing rear elevation of the host property. This neighbouring property has windows on the flank of the building but these appear to be secondary or non-habitable windows. The extension is set in from the neighbour boundary. On this basis, the proposal is not considered to be overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to this neighbour. \rNo flank windows are proposed to the first floor extension and so the proposal will not result in an additional overlooking beyond the established level of overlooking in the area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer does not give rise to any undue loss of amenity for neighbours. \r\rThe proposal is also not considered to result in undue levels of noise and disturbance or light pollution. \r\rFor these reasons, the development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and the proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
