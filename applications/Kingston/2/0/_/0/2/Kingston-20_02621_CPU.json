    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and the installation of 3no. rooflights to the front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. \r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rFirst Floor Side Extension -\rOfficers note that the proposed development would be visible within the streetscene, however, the proposal would not significantly detract from the host dwelling or surrounding area, as the houses on Beechcroft Avenue vary in design and size, therefore would not be an odd addition to the wider area. Additionally, the proposed side extension includes a pitched roof which would be consistent with the existing pitched roof element of the host dwelling and it would be set back from the front wall of the original house by approximately 3m and set down from the ridge of the existing roof by approximately 1.5m, in respect of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD.\r\rSingle-storey Rear Extension -\rThe proposed rear extension would have a total flat roof height of approximately 3.2m falling outside the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33, however, the proposed rear extension would have a depth of approximately 3m and would not be visible from the street scene. Additionally, it would appear small in scale and, therefore would not cause harm in regard to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or the wider area.\r\rGarage Conversion & Kerb Drop Alterations\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement with a window however, it is considered the proposal would not cause a significant negative impact on the streetscene of Beechcroft Avenue.\r\rOfficers note that a number of properties on the road have dropped kerbs, however, the proposed crossover would result in the loss of a significant amount of green verge. The loss of the grass verge would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DM 6 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylight of the proposed rear extension which would be a maximum of approximately 3.2m in height along the shared boundary with No. 75 Beechcroft Avenue. Officers acknowledge that the proposed development would fail the BRE 45-degree rule on both plan and elevation indicating a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground-floor window at No. 75 which serves a dining room (a habitable room). However, if the proposed rear extension had a reduced height to 3m, it could be constructed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution and in this case considered a fallback position that is given significant weight. \r\rTherefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking.\r\rThe proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rThe councils' Vehicle Crossover Policy, April 2020 states that an opening size, minimum of 2.7m and maximum of 4.0m must be provided at the back of the footway, measured at right angles to the public highway. The proposed vehicle crossover is proposed to be widened to approximately 4.5m falling outside the Vehicle Crossover Policy. Additionally, alteration to this crossover would require the removal of a grass verge greater than 2.0m deep, therefore is considered unacceptable. \r\rOverall, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on highways safety, the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
