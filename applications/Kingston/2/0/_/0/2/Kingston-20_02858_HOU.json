    "-- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultations \r\rNo response received. \r\rAssessment\r\rThe application is a section 73 application for a minor material amendment to planning permission 22/03123/FUL. The application seeks to amend the plans condition condition 1 of the permission to allow for the following changes \r\r- raise the ground floor ceiling height by 500mm to enable space for MVHR and pipework to be concealed increasing the overall height of the building by 500mm \r- changes to fenestration at ground floor to change window heights from 5 panes to 6 panes \r- and insertion of a new circular roof window\r\rAll other elements of the approved scheme remain unchanged and are not the subject of consideration under this application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. Paragraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed changes to the approved development are considered to be minor. The proposed changes are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the approved building or the surrounding area as a result of the proposed changes to the approved development. The site is in a Strategic Area of Special Character a non designated heritage asset. The proposal is considered to not cause any harm to the non designated heritage asset.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed changes to the approved development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConditions \r\rAll conditions from the approved scheme 22/03123/FUL should be carried forwarded with the plans condition updated with the relevant drawings and the 3 year time limit condition amended to run from the date of grant of planning permission ref 22/03123/FUL (the application being amended).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
