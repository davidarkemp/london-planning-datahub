    "The proposed development, by reason of the introduction of parked vehicles to an attractive pedestrian area, would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the design, layout, character and appearance of the area and would result in an environment that would be unduly dominated by cars. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "This application has  been submitted in pursuant to condition 6 (Lift Overruns) of application 22/01751/PAMA (Prior approval for the change of use from Retail (Use Class E) to 18no.x Dwelling houses (Use Class C3) at first and second floors.)\r\rCondition 10 reads: \r\rPrior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby approved, details of all lift overruns shall have been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details prior to the beneficial occupation of the development and retained as such. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rOfficer comment: The lift overrun would marginally exceed the height of the roof and would not be particularly noticeable from any public or private vantage points. The submitted details are considered satisfactory. The submitted details are hereby approved.",
