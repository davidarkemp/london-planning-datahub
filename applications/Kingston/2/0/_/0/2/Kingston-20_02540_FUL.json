    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultations \r\r2 responses received. One response raises concern re disruption during construction but supports the proposed development the other is in objection to the proposed development. The repsonses are summarised below and the matters raised are addressed through the officers assessment. \r\r- Effects on trees\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- Hours of construction\r- Noise \r- Fumes\r\rRelevant History\r21/03643/HOU -- Erection of first floor rear and rear canopy extension. Installation of 1nos front rooflight. Alteration to fenestrations -- Permitted with conditions\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is an amendment to the extant planning permission 21/03643/HOU. \r\rThe amendments include\r\r- Omission of chimney and rear roof lights\r- Altered rear canopy design\r- Insertion of additional first floor window on east elevation\r- Solar panels on rear roof slope\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed developmennt as did the extant planning permission 21/03643/HOU does not fully accord with the guiding principles of the Council's adopted Residential Design SPD. However it is considered in this instance in the context of the extant planning permissin and the site and its surroundings the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rGiven the orientation of the proposed development including the additions made to the extant planning permission it would pass the 45-degree plan test in relation to the closest habitable windows of the neighbouring properties, and as such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.  \r\rOther matters\r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the area sits within a Tree Preservation Area Order, and given that the trees of concern would be sited an appropriate distance from the proposed development officers consider that the proposal would not cause adverse harm to the protected tree on site, as such the proposal would accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire safety \r\rPolicy D12 of the London Plan requires all new development to give regard to fire safety. It is recommended that a condition is imposed to secure the submission of fire safety strategy in order to ensure that the proposed development would accord with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConstruction\rThe applicant will be bound by the primary legislation under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation such as building regs and the party wall act which includes acceptable hours of construction and control of noise, dust and other activities that could be of a nuisance to neighbouring occupiers during construction and the informatives attached draw the applicants attention to these matters. Any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted.

    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwelling house located along Ancaster Crescent. \rThe site is not located in a Conservation Area or Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal\rThis application seeks permission for the erection of a single-storey rear extension. Hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rPlanning History\r23/00780/HOU - Erection of single-storey rear extension and hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Granted planning permission, dated 26 May 2023.\r\rConsultations\r6no. neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No representations received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- The impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rCharacter & Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure approximately 3.3 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse (at its maximum), spanning the full width of the property and would have a pitched roof, with an eaves height of approximately 2.8 metres. This extension broadly conforms to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, and would also appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. Officers therefore consider that this element of the proposal would also have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse.  \r\rThe application also proposes alterations to the roof including change from hip to gable and the construction of a rear dormer extension. \r\rOfficers note that a similar hip to gable roof extension has been implemented at neighbouring property, No.40 Ancaster Crescent (ref. 13/14336/LDP), as well as No. 38 Ancaster Crescent (ref. 21/01562/HOU). The hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer under consideration in this case would not strictly accord with the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013. However, they would be in keeping with the character of the original dwelling and would be similar to those approved works at roof level at No's 38 and 40 Ancaster Crescent. \r\rThe only material difference between this application and the recently approved scheme (under 23/00780/HOU) is the proposed addition of matching tiles to the side elevation of the loft conversion. Officers note that there are other examples of houses along Ancaster Crescent that feature tile clad loft conversions to the side elevation.\r\rAs such, Officers consider that there would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse as a result of the proposed development. \r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThere would be no material difference proposed in terms of impact upon neighbouring amenity, given the proposed change is to the materiality of the side facing elevation of the loft conversion. It is considered therefore, that the proposed development would not affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties to an unacceptable degree by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design Guide, 2013.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed materials and roof form would not strictly relate to those of the existing dwelling, however, the proposed works would not be visible within the streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regard to neighbouring amenity, No. 31 Mount Road benefits from a rear extension along the boundary with No. 29 so no harm has been identified. With regard to No. 27 Mount Road, the proposed rear extension would be compliant with BRE guidance. It is also noted that the proposed roof has been designed to limit loss of daylight/sunlight to No.27 Mount Road. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r \rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing side extension, erection of two storey side and single storey front porch and rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony and installation of 3 nos front rooflights.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties were notified. No responses were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed hip to gable and two-storey side extension would not strictly accord with the Residential Design SPD (2013) guidance in that it would disrupt the symmetry shared with the adjoining property. However, it is acknowledged that a hip to gable extension could be achieved via permitted development rights. It is further noted that the extension would maintain a 1m set-in from the shared boundary with No. 43 and a set-down of 0.5m from the ridge of the roof which would limit any terracing effect. The two-storey extension would be set-back from the front elevation by approximately 1m which would ensure that part of the cat-slide roof is retained. Overall, it is therefore considered that the proposed two-storey side and roof extension would be proportionate and subordinate features.\r\rWhile the proposed 6m deep single storey rear extension would not accord with the Residential Design SPD (2013) guidance, it is noted that prior notification ref: 23/00301/PAEXT has been granted for a similar extension. While the extension would not be a proportionate addition, Officers attach significant weight to the permitted development fall-back position. Other elements of the proposal such as the front extension and rear dormer would not appear incongruous within the context of neighbouring extensions.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that neighbouring No. 47 has built a conservatory extension. While there would be some loss of outlook and loss of daylight as a result of the proposed 6m deep extension along the boundary, it is not considered that this impact would be significant. Furthermore, there is a permitted development fall-back position for a 6m deep extension in this location.\r\rWith regards to No. 43 to the north, there is a primary habitable room window at the first floor side elevation level which would be affected by the proposals (ref: 15/14755/HOU). It is noted that the affected window was granted permission on the basis of it being obscurely glazed (see Condition 5 of permission ref: 15/14755/HOU).\r\rIt is considered that the identified window would experience a noticeable reduction in daylight as a result of the proposed two-storey and roof extensions. However, given that the proposals maintain a 1m set-back from the site boundary it is considered that it would be unreasonable to preclude No. 45 from extending in a similar manner to No. 47. Furthermore, it is noted that the proposed side facing windows at No. 45 would all be obscurely glazed and non-opening below 1.8m above finished internal floor level. Regarding rear facing habitable room windows, the set-back from the site boundary would ensure no significant adverse impact to these rooms. Regarding additional rear facing windows, it is not considered that this would result in any significant loss of privacy to neighbours when compared to the existing situation.\r\rOverall, within the context of established permitted development fall-back positions and neighbouring extensions, it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Representations\r8no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development and 2no. objections were received relating to:\r-\tAccess or traffic problems\r-\tCar park issues\r-\tFumes\r-\tInappropriate design/layout\r-\tLoss of light/sunlight\r-\tNoise\r-\tOverlooking / loss of privacy\r-\tUnacceptable or incompatible use\r\rOfficer comments: The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rPlanning History\rThe planning history that is relevant to this application is:\r22/03919/FUL - Conversion of the existing detached garage into a 1no 2 bedroom bungalow with a separate access - Refused planning permission, dated 14 Feb 2022 for the following reasons:\r\r(1)\tThe proposal would not provide an adequate quantum of internal floorspace or privacy for all habitable rooms, would not be considered a wholly dual aspect dwelling, or meet the required floor to ceiling heights, and as such it is considered that the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation, which would be contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF 2021.\r\r(2)\tGiven that backland development is uncharacteristic of the form of the area and the proposal would divide the existing garden land, and add additional parking to the rear of the site, the proposal would appear visually out of keeping with the characteristic form of development within the immediate vicinity, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF 2021.\r\r(3)\tThe two proposed on-site parking spaces have not been safely designed and could not be safely accessed, and as such officers are not satisfied that the proposal would not unduly increase parking stress and demand within the surrounding area, and adversely impact on pedestrian and highway safety. . Further given that inadequate details have been provided for pedestrian movement along the access road, the quality of the access road, and the use of the road for the sports and cricket ground, it is considered that the proposal would have adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r(4)\tGiven the substantial separation distance of the proposed development from Somerset Avenue, and that the applicant has not provided sufficient details of waste collection, Officers are unable to assess the acceptability of waste arrangements to serve the proposed dwelling which could result in the proposal impeding upon pedestrian and highway safety and appearing a visual nuisance on collection day. This would be contrary to the NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r(5)\tThe applicant has not provided a fire safety strategy and the existing access road would not allow sufficient space for an emergency vehicle to safely enter the site, and as such the proposal would not adhere to Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.\r\r16/10002/HOU - Proposed conversion of garage into a habitable room - Withdrawn, 15 Jan 2016.\r\r13/10387/HOU - Erection of a single storey detached garage and workshop - Granted planning permission, dated 5 June 2014. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of the existing detached garage into a 1no. 2-bedroom bungalow with a separate access. Installation of solar panels. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tHousing delivery:\r-\tThe standard of accommodation provided;\r-\tThe impact upon the character and appearance of the area;\r-\tThe impact upon the residential amenity;\r-\tThe impact upon highway safety;\r-\tThe provision of adequate cycle storage facilities;\r-\tFlood Risk Assessment and drainage; \r-\tThe impact on protected trees; \r-\tFire safety;\r-\tThe impact on sustainability;\r-\tThe impact on biodiversity; \r-\tOther matters; and,\r-\tThe contribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\r\rHousing Delivery\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of The London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF 2021 indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThe proposed development would provide a net increase of one single dwelling on site which would constitute a small, albeit positive contribution towards this target. The scheme would utilise the rear amenity space of 34 Somerset Avenue, and as such the site is considered as being garden land and will be assessed on this basis. While there are no specific policies in the London Plan or Core Strategy that prevent development of garden land, there is emphasis on ensuring that new development is sympathetic to the surrounding area, and as such the acceptability of the development in this specific location will be set out in the Character and Design section of this  report. However, with the area being a residential location, the principle of development is considered to be acceptable, subject to compliance with other Development Plan policies. This holds substantial weight in favour of the proposal.\r\rStandard of Accommodation                                                                                 \rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                                           \rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher figure of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms.\r\rThe proposal seeks to provide 1x2 bed dwelling on one floor as a 4 person dwelling. For this sized property, Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 would require an internal floorspace of 70sqm, and given that approx. 63.3sqm would be provided as set out in the Design and Access Statement, officers note that it would fall short of the requirements set out in the London Plan. \r\rThe proposed dwelling would benefit from the required built-in storage space and floor to ceiling height. However, given the proximity of the proposed dwelling to the rear and side boundary treatment, the proposal could be largely considered a single aspect dwelling that is mainly eastern facing with limited resultant outlook and natural daylight/sunlight ingress. \rOfficers also note that the principal window for bedroom 1 would sit in close proximity to the shared boundary to the rear of the site, which would provide limited outlook and privacy given the proximity to the Cricket Club to the west of the site.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would provide approx. 60sqm of private outdoor amenity space, which would well exceed the requirements of the Residential Design SPD. While there is sufficient amenity space, officers note the changes in levels across the site and, given that the existing dwelling would sit at a higher level, officers consider there to be a loss of privacy, however this could be lessened by appropriate boundary treatment, if planning permission were forthcoming.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposal would not strictly comply with the policy requirements of the London plan, given that the proposal would not provide an adequate quantum of internal floorspace or privacy for all habitable rooms and would not be considered a wholly dual aspect dwelling with resultant poor degree of outlook and natural daylight/sunlight ingress, it is considered that the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation. This carries substantial weight against the proposal.\r\rImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) states that new development should respond to the existing character of a place by identifying the special and valued characteristics of the locality and be of a high quality in terms of design.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers note that the proposal would utilise the existing detached garden office to the rear of the site. The proposal would not create any additional floor space, but would alter the fenestrations to include additional openings. The proposal would also amend the materiality to appear more in keeping with the existing dwelling, and as such would appear more as an independent dwelling rather than an ancillary outbuilding. \r\rOfficers note that the proposal would add additional boundary treatment to divide the existing garden land. Given that the subdivision of plots is not a common feature of the form of the immediate surrounding area, and that the proposal would appear less like an ancillary building and more so of an independent dwelling, Officers consider that the proposal would appear more cramped within the existing plot which would not be in keeping with the established character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rConsistent with the previous assessment, given that backland development is uncharacteristic of the form of the area, the proposal would appear visually out of keeping with the dwellings in the immediate vicinity. This holds substantial weight against the proposal.\r\rImpact upon the Residential Amenity of Neighbouring Occupiers\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal would utilise the existing building on site, and therefore it is considered that there would be no overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight for the occupants of neighbouring properties. \r\rWhile there would be an intensification of the site for residential use, rather than ancillary use, given that neighbouring properties would be adequately separated from the proposed development, there would be no adverse impact in relation to privacy for the occupants of neighbouring properties. \r\rGiven that no amenity concerns have been raised, this would be of neutral weight in the balance.\r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) states that car-free developments should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking; and an absence of local on-street parking controls should not be a barrier to new development. Table 10.3 then sets out the maximum residential parking standards. \r\rThe site is located within an area with a PTAL rating of 2 and on-street parking is not restricted within Somerset Avenue. For properties of the size proposed and in this particular location, table 10.3 of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum requirement of 0.75 spaces per dwelling. The dwelling would be car-free.\r\rIt is also noted that the applicant would remove the existing gates to the front of the access road, and add a new gate to the end of the access road. Whilst the applicant does not own this land, the supporting design and access statement sets out that the Facilities Manager at Hollyfield School Sports Ground supports the proposed relocation of the gates and provides email correspondence as evidence to this effect. In this case, subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement, Officers would be satisfied that the relocation of the gates could be delivered in the way proposed, and would therefore not compromise the ability to provide safe car parking on site in this respect.\r\rOfficers note that the supporting design and access statement sets out that the applicant would repair the collapsed drain and any road repairs at their own cost. This would also involve the installation of solar powered lights and re-surfaced tarmacadam so as to improve both the vehicular and pedestrian conditions of the access road. This is welcomed and officers would have attached appropriately worded conditions to this effect to secure such improvements.\r\rOverall, subject to appropriately worded conditions and the applicant entering into a legal agreement to secure the relocation of the access gate to the neighbouring school sports ground, it is considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety, in general accordance Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy T4 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r\rProvision of Adequate Cycle Storage Facilities\rFigure 10.3 of the London Plan (2021), the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames has higher minimum cycle parking standards as TFL has identified that there is high potential for a switch to cycling within the Borough. Table 10.2 (Minimum cycle parking standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out minimum cycle parking standards. For a property of the size proposed, there would be a requirement for two cycle spaces. Details of the cycle storage have been provided and this could be secured by an appropriately worded condition if permission were forthcoming. This would hold neutral weight.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOn the basis that the proposal would ultilise the existing building on site, which has already been raised above ground level, it is considered that the proposal would not increase the possibility of flooding on site or elsewhere. On the basis that the floor level is appropriately above the likely flood level the residential unit should not be subject to flooding. It has not, however, been demonstrated how egress would be made from the proposed dwelling.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rSustainability \rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes level.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed development would be required to demonstrate that water consumption of 105l could also be achieved - this could be secured via an appropriate condition if planning permission were forthcoming. \r\rOther Matters\rWaste and Recycling\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 require integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rDetails of the storage for waste and recycling have been provided on the plans. \r\rWhilst further details could be secured via a condition, officers note that inadequate information has been provided in regards to the details of waste collection. Given that the dwelling would be sited approx. 37m from Somerset Avenue, Officers are unable to assess the acceptability of waste arrangements to serve the proposed dwelling, in terms of capacity or siting for its collection by Council operatives. This would hold moderate weight against the proposal.\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 4 with a charge of £50 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance \rSubstantial weight is given in favour to the provision of one net additional residential dwellinghouse. \r\rThe proposal would not provide an adequate quantum of internal floorspace or privacy for all habitable rooms, would not be considered a wholly dual aspect dwelling, with poor outlook and natural light ingress to the accommodation, and as such it is considered that the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation. This would hold substantial weight against the proposal.\r\rWhilst the proposal would utilise the existing outbuilding on site, given that backland development is uncharacteristic of the built form of the area and the proposal would divide the existing garden land, the proposal would appear visually out of keeping with the characteristic form of development within the immediate vicinity. This holds moderate weight against the proposal.\r\rThe proposal would not give rise to any amenity concerns for the future occupiers of the proposed development or existing occupiers of neighbouring properties, which would hold neutral weight.\r\rCycle parking provision as shown on the proposed plans could be secured by an appropriately worded condition in the event of an approval. This would hold neutral weight.\rIt has been demonstrated in this location that a residential unit could be made to be safe from a fire safety point of view. This would hold neutral weight.\r\rThe proposed dwelling is shown to be car-free. Subject to appropriately worded conditions and a signed legal agreement to secure the re-siting of the access gate to the School Sports Ground, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in highways terms. \r\rGiven the separation distance of the proposed development from Somerset Avenue, and that the applicant has not provided sufficient details of waste collection, Officers are unable to assess the acceptability of waste arrangements to serve the proposed dwelling. This could impede pedestrian and highway safety and appear a visual nuisance on collection day. This holds substantial weight against the proposal.\r\rOverall and on balance it is considered that the adverse impacts of the proposed development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the Framework taken as a whole.\r",
    "Consultations\r26no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No comments received.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey log cabin to the rear, with associated concrete base.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe site comprises a semi-detached two-storey (with converted roofspace) residential property on the eastern side of King Charles Road, Surbiton. The application building has been converted into self-contained flats. This application pertains to the private rear garden of Flat 4. \r\rThe site lies adjacent to, but not within, the Surbiton Hill Conservation Area. \r\rThe site falls within the Berrylands Road Local Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset).\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance, including heritage assets; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire safety assessment\r\rCharacter and Appearance, including Impact upon Heritage Assets\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rAt paragraph 203 of the NPPF, the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAccordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r-\tRecognises distinctive local features and character\r-\tHas regard to the historic and natural environment\r-\tHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r-\tAccords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r-\tRelates well and connects to its surroundings\r\rPolicy Guidance 41 (Outbuildings) is applicable to the application. The SPD outlines that where they are used as ancillary to the use of the existing house (sheds, greenhouses, hobby rooms or storerooms) that planning permission is generally not required. In this case, the existing outbuilding would be for the use of a gym and a bathroom and as such, will require planning permission.\r\rIn terms of scale and design, the guidance advises that in general outbuildings should be positioned as far away as possible from any shared boundaries to stop overshadowing of neighbouring properties; should not be built forward of the established building line; should relate well to the design of the existing house; generally be built of similar materials to the existing house; and not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the outbuilding should be replaced on site. \r\rThis planning application pertains to Flat 4 which is afforded a private rear garden to the rear of the building.\r\rIn terms of scale, the outbuilding is considered to appear as an appropriate addition to the site and host property by way of its modest height of 2.4m (to eaves), 3.3m (to its pitch). The outbuilding would occupy approximately just under half of the width of the plot (at approximately 4m) and would have a depth of 5m. Officers acknowledge that it would be screened on three sides by boundary treatment (fencing) to a height of 1.8m and, this, together with the proposed siting inset at a distance of approximately 1m from the northern and eastern side boundaries and 5m from the southern side boundary, means the outbuilding is appropriately positioned so as not to appear overly obtrusive.\r\rIn terms of design, the proposed use of painted timber to the front, rear and two side external walls, grey shingle tiles for the roof and double-glazed window and door frames is considered to be acceptable for such type of garden structure. \r\rMore than 50% of the amenity space will remain and, therefore, it is not found that this will have a detrimental impact on the amenity and character of the property. \r\rAs a result, the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property or the wide area and therefore would accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012. Similarly, the proposal is considered to have a neutral impact upon the non-designated heritage asset of Berrylands Road Local Area of Special Character, and accord with the objectives of Policy DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 in this regard.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\r1no. entrance door and 2no. windows are proposed to the front elevation of the outbuilding (facing south) set a distance of approximately 5m from the side boundary fencing. 1no. side facing window is proposed to the western side elevation (facing towards the rear of No. 27 King Charles Road). The window would be at a distance of 12m from the rear of No. 27 King Charles Road. On balance, it is not considered that the proposals would give rise to materially harmful overlooking or loss of privacy. \r\rThe proposed windows are not considered to pose impacts on neighbouring amenity.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe trees situated within the application site are subject to Tree Preservation Order. \r\rProposal \rErection of outbuilding, climbing frame and swing to rear, changes to ground floor side fenestration, increase to first floor front balcony depth, alterations to front dormer roof. Retrospective application for installation of 4nos. air conditioning units on the first floor and landscaping.\r\rConsultations\rMaldens And Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - objects to the proposal:\r\rReason for objection: Relatively minor alterations (adding only 7m2) and landscaping - using materials replicating on site or in use in neighbouring properties. The proposed use of uPVC door should be replaced by a door of a more sympathetic material. Objection unless revised as above. \r\rTree Officer - no objection\r\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. \rFour representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight \r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- The submitted plans don't show the current building status, the property boundaries have been drawn incorrectly\r- Right of Light\r- Noise and environmental pollution during construction works\r- raised ground level would damage the adjoining property (impact on foundations and its structural integrity, damp issues)\r- installation of AC units raises noise issues, visual impact and energy efficiency concerns\r- Effects on trees\r\rOfficer response: \rAny matters controlled under non-planning laws (such as right to light), building regulations or problems arising from the construction period are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment.\r\rAny other concerns raised with the written representations will be addressed with this report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r-The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rOfficers note differences in ground level at Ridge House as per available maps (RBK Lidar Contour). The front of the application site starts at the level of 32m and slopes down towards the rear to 28m.\r\rThe submitted proposed plans and Design and Access Statement suggest that the ground levels to the rear were raised by 400mm and the new raised patio area of 300mm has been erected as part of the retrospective works. \r\rThe proposed ground floor drawing (36-062) shows a 'new level patio area' to the front of the property. \r\rIt is considered that insufficient information with regards to the pre-existing and existing (as the raised ground levels form the retrospective part of the proposal) ground levels in relation to all the adjoining properties was submitted to demonstrate that the raised ground levels and the raised patio area would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As the proposed ground levels and raised patio levels would trigger alterations to boundary treatment and given its scale, on balance, this element of the proposal is likely to adversely affect the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed outbuilding would be approximately 2.5m high and situated on the raised patio area in the north-east corner of the property. While the erection of an outbuilding with a flat roof of the total height of approximately 2.5m would generally fall within the permitted development rights, in this case the proposed/retrospective works include raised ground levels and raised patio area and therefore would not benefit from this 'fallback' position. \r\rThe proposed climbing frame (approximately 2.75m high) situated along the east common boundary and on the raised ground level, given its siting and the proposed scale, is considered to be acceptable from the design point of view. \r\rIt is noted that  Maldens and Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee raised objection to the proposed alterations to fenestration in terms of the proposed materials. The new UPVC sliding door to the side elevation at the ground floor level should be finished in more sympathetic materials. \r\rThe proposed increase of the depth of the front balcony by approximately 300mm, given its siting is considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling.\r\rWith regards to the proposed alterations to the front rear dormer to the office outbuilding, the proposed increase in width and height of the dormer, given its siting, scale, mass and bulk is considered to be acceptable although not in strict accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed and existing heat pump air conditioning units given their scale and siting are considered to be acceptable from the character and appearance perspective. \r\rOverall, it is considered that insufficient information was submitted in relation to the retrospective and significant changes to the ground levels to demonstrate, on balance, that this element of the proposal would not not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application falls within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: the estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless contributes positively to the conservation area. As per the paragraph above, Officers raise concerns in relation to the proposed changes to the ground levels, it is likely that this element of the proposal would not be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rFurthermore, the Conservation Areas Advisory Committee raised concerns with regards to the proposed materials for the sliding door at the ground floor level in the side elevation, that should be more appropriate for properties located in conservation areas. \r\rHaving regard to the above, Officers conclude that it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance.  \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development is likely to result in an adverse impact to the host property and therefore have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  result in harm to the significance of this LASC.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed alterations to fenestration, to the front balcony and front roof dormer, given its scale and siting would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers at the adjoining properties. \r\rWith regards to the proposed increase in ground levels, provision of raised patio area and the climbing frame, given the difference in ground levels, it has not been demonstrated that it would not adversely affect the amenities of the adjoining occupiers in terms of an overbearing appearance, undue overlooking and loss of privacy. \r\rWhile the installation of air conditioning units is considerd to be acceptable, additional details of the level of noise would be secure via condition. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rIt is noted that the Council's Tree Officer raised no objection to the proposal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed and are hereby approved, subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 4 (Fire Safety Strategy) of planning permission 23/01130/HOU, which states:\r\rPrior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022),  where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\r",
    "PREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY\rApplication reference 23/00911/HOU - Demolition of garage and erection of two storey side and rear extension and part single storey front extension. Alterations to roof to facilitate loft conversion. Granted planning permission, dated 12 June 2023.\r\rCONSULTATIONS\r6no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No representations received.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwelling house located along Minstead Way. \r\rThe site is not located within a conservation area, or local area of special character and the application property is not statutory or locally listed. \r\rPROPOSAL\rApplication under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) for Application Reference Number: 23/00911/HOU (Demolition of garage and erection of two storey side and rear extension and part single storey front extension. Alterations to roof to facilitate loft conversion) dated: 12/06/2023. Variation to consist of changes to colour of roof tiles and window frames to grey.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development, impact upon character and appearance and impact upon neighbouring residential amenity.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission.\r\rIt is acknowledged that there is no statutory definition of a minor material amendment (MMA) although the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) explains that a MMA is 'likely to include any amendment where its scale and/or nature results in a development which is not substantially different from the one which has been approved'.\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area (including heritage assets)\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed changes submitted under this application to the approved permission comprise of the change to the colour of roof tiles to grey and window frames to grey. The materiality would remain unchanged from the original permission, the finish (i.e. colour) would alter.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the building and wider area. \r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Residential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed changes would not create any material loss of amenity or privacy beyond that assessed under the original application. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed amendments to Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission reference 23/00911/HOU are considered to maintain appropriate good quality design and would not result in material difference or material harm in terms of character and appearance of the proposed development, nor in terms of impacts upon neighbouring amenity. The proposals are considered to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.  \r\rRECOMMENDATION\rGrant planning permission.\r",
    "Condition 15 (Fire Safety) of planning permission 23/00180/FUL states: \r\rPrior to any above ground works (excluding demolition)  a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted Planning Fire Safety Statement for Residential Development at 12-14 Sycamore Grove, New Malden KT3 3DQ is considered to be sufficient. As such, details submitted in relation to Condition 15 (Fire Safety Strategy) are hereby approved. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Planning Fire Safety Statement and thereafter maintained. \r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r5 Surrounding properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed solar panels would be located on the two storey side extension and roof extension granted through planning permission 23/00019/HOU. Officers acknowledge that the solar panels would be slightly visible from the road and would raise the existing roof height by approximately 270mm. However, the proposed solar panels would not bring harm to the surrounding area with regard to character and appearance due to their relatively small scale. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
