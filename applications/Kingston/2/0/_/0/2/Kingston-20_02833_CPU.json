    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The local planning authority must be satisfied that the amendment sought is non-material in order to grant an application under section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the wording of condition 34 of planning permission no 20/00825/FUL (Variation of Conditions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 20, 22, 34 & 36 of Planning Permission ref: 17/14178/FUL for amendments to wording (Please see covering letter dated 6th April 2020) to provide M4(3) wheelchair adaptable flats instead of the M4(3) wheelchair accessible flats. \r\rThe planning permission requires 10% (8 apartments) of the units to be wheelchair accessible. The current non material amendment application seeks 6 units on the 2nd, 3rd and 4th floors to be changed to M4(3) wheelchair adaptable apartments. The remaining 2 apartments on the first floor would stay as wheelchair accessible M4(3) units. \r\rAs the amended proposal does not include any external alterations and it would still provide 10% of M4(3) compliant apartments, the proposed amendments are considered to be non material. \r\rThe following wording of condition 34 of the planning permission no 20/00825/FUL: \r\rPrior to the commencement of the development hereby permitted (excluding demolition works and below ground work), details shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority demonstrating that a minimum of 10% of the units are wheelchair accessible. \r\rReason: The details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to ensure that an adequate level of accessible units are provided in accordance with Policy 3.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM13 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012) and the Mayor's Housing SPG (2016).\r\rIs replaced with: \r\rPrior to beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, details shall be submitted to, and approved in writing by, the Local Planning Authority demonstrating that 6 units are M4(3) wheelchair adaptable and 2 units are M4(3) wheelchair accessible.\r\rReason: To ensure that an adequate level of accessible units are provided in accordance with Policy D7 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM13 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012) and the Mayor's Housing SPG (2017).\r",
