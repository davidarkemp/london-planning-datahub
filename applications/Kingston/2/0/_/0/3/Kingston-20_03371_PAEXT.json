    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Elm Road, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the addition of the proposed two-storey rear extension would appear slightly bulky. However, the extension would generally comply with the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD; it would relate well to the host property and would not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof and the proposal would maintain adequate separation distances between neighbouring properties.\r\rWhilst the ground floor rear extension would not mirror the host dwelling roof form, it is considered that the proposal would appear a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host building and would not be an incongruous addition in the immediate vicinity of Chestnut Grove.\r\rOverall, on balance, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe applicant submitted plans and elevation demonstrating the 45-degree rule and officers concluded that the single-storey rear extension would not cause any significant loss of light to neighbouring property No. 95c (ground floor maisonette) and No.99 Chestnut Grove. The proposed single-storey rear extension would not extend past the existing rear extension at No.99 and in relation to No.95c the design and distance of the proposed single-storey extension would not cause significant loss of light.\r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated the impact of the two-storey rear extension using the BRE 25 Degree-Rule, but rather the 45-degree rule. Officers have assessed the proposed two-storey extension and found that it would breach the 25-degree rule in relation to the closest ground-floor windows at No.95c Chestnut Grove. However, the ground floor windows facing the No.97 serve a kitchen and a bathroom which are considered to be non-habitable rooms, therefore, the proposed two-storey rear extension would not cause significant harm to the amenities of No.95c.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would generally be in keeping with the guidance within the Residential Design SPD and would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would result in any harm to Elm Road, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
