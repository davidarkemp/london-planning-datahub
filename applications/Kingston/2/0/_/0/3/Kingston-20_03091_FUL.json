    "The proposed development fails to provide any affordable housing on-site, contrary to the findings of the Independent Viability Assessor which concluded that 6 affordable dwellings could viably be delivered on-site and contrary to Policies H4 and H5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM15 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent and up to date evidence that the proposed development would not harm protected species, contrary to the NPPF (2019) and the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 (as amended), The Protection of Badgers Act (1992) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations (2017), Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM6 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been demonstrated, through the submission of robust or cogent information, that the proposed dwellings would provide a good standard of accommodation with good levels of daylight and sunlight and no dedicated playspace would be provided on-site for future occupants, contrary to  Policies D4 and D6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2021).",
    "The proposed development would be excessive in height, bulk and mass and would appear incongruous within the street scene which would detract from the character and appearance of the existing site and the surrounding area, contrary to the NPPF (2019), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "No mechanism to preclude residents of the proposed development from applying for on street residents parking permits (including visitor permits) and for permits to park in Council-owned car parks in the area has been submitted. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not increase on-street car parking stress and would not harm highway safety, contrary to paragraph 109 of the NPPF (2019) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been robustly demonstrated that the proposed development would comply with the drainage hierarchy and that the proposed development would not increase flood risk on-site or elsewhere, contrary to the NPPF 2019, Policy SI 13 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to robustly demonstrate that the site is unsuitable to provide a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3 or more bedroom units and no robust arguments or evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that a policy compliant provision of 3 or more bedroom units would be unviable. The proposed development would fail to contribute towards meeting the objectively assessed need within the Borough for 3 bedroom units. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",
    "No mechanism to secure the required net-zero carbon offsetting payment has been submitted and it has not been demonstrated that the minimum Urban Greening Factor target of 0.4 would be achieved on site.  It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would be zero carbon and would incorporate high-quality landscaping, contrary to Policies G5 and SI 2 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM3 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",

Granted 25.09.2023\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed dormer would not generally comply with the guidance in the Residential Design SPD (Dormer Windows) in regard to maintaining 500mm from the eaves, sides and ridge. However, it could be constructed under permitted development (ref:23/02097/CPU), officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution. In addition, officers note that the proposed material would include the use of metal cladding for the construction of the dormer, which would not resemble the existing material on the dwelling, however, the dormer would not be visible in the streetscene, therefore would not cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the wider area.\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed hip-to-gable would cause a visual imbalance to the adjoining neighboring property No. 7 Kings Drive, as they do not benefit from a hip-to-gable extension. However, as mentioned above, the proposed roof extension could mostly be constructed under permitted development (ref:23/02097/CPU)\r\rOn balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and change to side fenestration\r\rConsultation\r7 neigbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the limited height of the proposed rear extension at 3m with a flat roof no unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight to the adjoining neighbouring property has been identified. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "he site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Town Centre, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to Noise, Loss of light/Sunlight and Privacy (full representation held on the file)\r\rOfficers acknowledge the objection regarding noise, however, officers would not expect noise levels from a development of this scale to be unacceptable to neighbouring properties. All other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings (the site and neighbouring land and buildings).\r- Fire Safety\r- Flood Risk\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Paragraph 4.29 of the residential Design SPD states that proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This is particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. However, officers acknowledge that neighbouring property No. 60 The Bittoms benefits from a similar proposal, granted through planning permission ref: 22/01838/HOU, therefore, on this occasion, the proposed hip-to-gable extension would bring balance back to the pair of semi-detached dwellings, and in any event, whist it would represent a change to the original design of the property, it would nonetheless be an acceptable change. \r\rAdditionally, given that the proposal (or indeed a proposal that is materially similar) could be constructed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a subsequent solution. In addition, in the context of other houses in the street or wider area, this construction of a hip-to-gable would not be unusual. \r\rOfficers noted that Policy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD states that flat roofs should generally be avoided for the construction of a first-floor rear extension, especially if this is not a common feature on the original dwelling. However, the proposed first-floor rear extension is small in scale and would be hidden from the streetscene, therefore, would not cause harm to the character and appearance of the streetscene. Whilst there would be views of the rear extension from neighbouring properties, the resultant design subject to matching materials, would blend into the backdrop of the original property. \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 25 and 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Any increase in potential overlooking would nonetheless be commensurate with the level of overlooking that is generally present in an urban area. With regards to noise, there is no reason to conclude that noise levels would increase as a result of the proposed development. \r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would not generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however, it would not be an odd addition to The Bittoms. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Town Centre Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rFlood Risk\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst officers acknowledge the submitted Flood Risk Assessment, a planning condition is required to ensure that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and that appropriate floodproofing of the proposed development has been incorporated, in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the representation that has been received is noted, however for the reasons cited above Officers conclude that the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 22/02014/HOU:\r- Addition of 2no. rooflights.\r- Omission and replacement of the proposed 2nd-floor window with juliet balcony\r\rThe Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent. This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
    "The application site is located on the grass verge on the eastern side of South Lane north of the junction of Selwyn Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The immediate surrounding buildings and curtilage/land are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\r32 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposal and 1 representations in support have been received.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the proposed Installation of 17.5m monopole with 6 no. antennas, 2 no. equipment cabinets, 2 no. transmission dishes and ancillary development thereto including the installation of 3 no. remote radio units.\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the current Development Plan policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2023 states in paragraph 121 states  Applications for electronic communications development (including applications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development Order) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development. This should include:\r\ra) the outcome of consultations with organisations with an interest in the proposed development, in particular with the relevant body where a mast is to be installed near a school or college, or within a statutory safeguarding zone surrounding an aerodrome, technical site or military explosives storage area; and\r\rb) for an addition to an existing mast or base station, a statement that self-certifies that the cumulative exposure, when operational, will not exceed International Commission guidelines on non-ionising radiation protection; or\r\rc) for a new mast or base station, evidence that the applicant has explored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or other structure and a statement that self-certifies that, when operational, International Commission guidelines will be met.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2023 is clear at paragraph 122 in that the Local Planning Authority should not question the need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location on the roadside verge on the east side of South Lane Road north of the Selwyn Road junction and opposite and adjacent to a number of residential properties.\r\rThe height of the mast would be 17.5m which would be in excess of 7.5m to 9.5m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. In addition the proposal would have a number of equipment cabinets surrounding the base of the mast which would increase the mass of street furniture on the site. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal with in particular its height and proliferation of equipment cabinets at its base would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene, that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and reduce the openness of the verge and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance of the telecoms apparatus would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rHaving reviewed the applicants sequential approach to site selection, officers are not satisfied that alternative sites have been thoroughly assessed with the reasons for discounting other sites seemingly lacking detail or fully reasoned, and, the site search being limited in its reach. Officers are not satisfied that the application site represents the least harmful option available in the area to meet the additional coverage and capacity requirements.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits.\r\r",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r6 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  One letter of neutral interest  was submitted. \rAwareness of the project's potential for biodiversity enhancement. Homeowner may like to take the opportunity to install swift boxes on the property at roof level to promote swift conservation in their area.\r\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension. Roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony and installation of 2no rooflights.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises  mid terrace dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey rear extension. Roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony and installation of 2no rooflights. \r\rThe dwelling has an existing single storey rear  projection  with a single aspect pitch tiled roof with  an eaves height of 2.565m and pitch roof height of 3.437m.  It has an existing single storey original rear projection with a depth of 0.932m and a single aspect pitch tiles roof with an eaves height of 2.5m and maximum pitch roof height of 3.44m.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project a depth of 4m and width 6.422m. It would have a proposed flat roof height of 3m. Officers note the retention of the existing extension  would project a depth of 4.8m  and a width of 2.6m.  It would have a flat roof height of 3m. Officers note the retention of the original rear projection single aspect roof to retain continuity with neighbouring property.  In terms of proposed finishes and materials, the proposed rear elevation would be finished in a light render and accommodate a single upvc window and bifolding doors. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would have a length of 6.147m, width of 2.4 and depth of 3.35m. It would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD  given that it would not be appropriately set down from the roof ridge nor set in from the 'edges' of the roof for the individual terrace house, however it is noted it would be equally set in and as such would be a proportionate addition to the host property. Officers note there are other examples of rear dormers on nearby similar  terrace residential blocks  - nos 42 and 44 Wilverley Crescent. In terms of proposed finishes and materials, the proposed rear dormer would accommodate upvc double glazed windows and be finished in vertical tile hanging to match the existing roof colour.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear  side extension together with the proposed rear dormer, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties  to consider in relation to amenity are neighbouring properties nos 34 and 38 Wilverley Crescent.\r\rA shared boundary exists between no 36 and no 34 Wilverley Crescent comprising part of a 1.9m close boarded fence  and continues with a lower height boundary. The existing rear elevation of no 34  presents a  single glazed door and adjoining glazed windows either side. \r\rn considering the impact on daylight  at no 34 by the proposed extension, the proposals would pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable window taking account of the full width  and arrangement of the glazing on the rear elevation . Within this context, it is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour.\r\rIn respect  of neighbouring no 38 Wilverley Crescent  a shared boundary exists between nos  36 and 38 Wilverley Crescent consisting of a 1.9m close boarded fence closest to the dwelling  which continues at a lower height beyond the existing decking. In considering the impact on daylight  at no 34 by the proposed extension, the proposals would pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable window. It is noted that the ground floor at this property is served by additional rear facing  windows along the existing rear elevation.  Within this context, it is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A) the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of single storey rear extension and single storey front porch. \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a terrace dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey rear extension and single storey front porch.  \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project a depth of 4m and width of 5.244m. It would have a single aspect pitch roof with a pitch roof height of  3.589m and eaves roof height of 2.934m.    The proposed roof would be covered in interlocking clay tiles and accommodate no2 rooflights.  In terms of proposed materials and finishes, the walls would be rendered to match the existing and the proposed windows and doors would be UPVC to match existing. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the depth of the overall  proposed extension would not comply with the guidelines in the Residential Design SPD Policy Guidance 33 which recommends a total depth of 3.5m for terrace dwellings. However, the principle of a single storey rear extension  of a similar depth (3m)  and pitch roof ( 3.65m) and eaves height ( 2.6m)  has been established  with the implementation of a single storey extension at neighbouring no 25 Cavendish Road (Planning Ref 13/14608/LDP).\r\rThe proposed single storey front porch extension would project a depth of 0.864m and width  of 1.939m.  It would have a proposed eaves height above the proposed glazed doors  of 2.225m and a flat roof height of 3.384m. It is noted that the  front building line of the new porch would be in alignment with neighbouring no 25 Cavendish Road.  However, Officers note there is an inconsistency in the submitted drawings  in respect of this aspect of the proposal. The proposed front elevation of the  front porch extension has been annotated to state that the built form would have a new roof with plain clay tiles however there is no illustrative detail. In reviewing the proposed first floor and roof plan, the drawings do not indicate there would be a roofslope as it denotes the proposed roof would be a flat roof arrangement. In addition, the proposed section   A-A does not show a proposed single storey front porch extension in situ (i.e single storey built form and the profile of a single aspect roof)  as the glazing on the side of the existing bay window remains in view.\r\r\rDue to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans Officers are unable to fully assess the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the host dwelling or the immediate surrounding area. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate , through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance, and would therefore  be in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties to consider in relation to amenity  are neighbouring properties at nos 25 and 29 Cavendish Road. Officers have assessed the impact on daylight  of the proposed rear extension using BRE45 degree rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimal impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rOfficers note  neighbouring no 25 Cavendish Road has an existing rear single storey extension of 3m in depth. In considering the impact on daylight at no25 by the proposed extension,  the proposals would not pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable room window and would result in the significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room at ground level in comparison with the existing situation.  \r \rIn considering the impact on daylight of no 29 Cavendish Road by the proposed extension, it is considered that the proposals would not pass  BRE 45 degree rule and would result in the significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room at ground level in comparison with the existing situation .  \r\rIn addition, due to its siting and depth along the boundary with no 29, it is considered that the proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development and present an overbearing appearance in this location \r\rOfficer Comment:  \rOverall , given the size of the proposed development and its siting in relation to the neighbouring properties of nos 25 and 29 Cavendish Road, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of  occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of  overbearing appearance and loss of light. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The single storey rear extension would not strictly comply with the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD, as it would extend from the original rear wall by 4m, failing to comply with Policy Guidance 33. However, the extension would have a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.6m, appearing subordinate to the host dwelling and would not be visible from the streetscene.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed dormer would not be sufficiently set in from the eaves, sides and ridge by at least 500mm however, the dormer would not be visible to the street scene and would have matching materials to those used in the construction of the existing dwelling. In addition, given that this aspect of the development could be constructed under permitted development, this fallback position is given substantial weight in this matter.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment:  Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD, to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
