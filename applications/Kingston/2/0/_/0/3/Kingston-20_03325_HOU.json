This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non material amendment to planning permission ref. no 21/02500/HOU to allow change of bifold doors for a smaller door and a window at the rear elevation.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "This application is a re submission of previously approved application 20/03309/FUL which is due to lapse next month. There have been no material changes in circumstances (such as the development plan for instance) that would lead to the council making a different decision to that of approved consent 20/03309/FUL. \r\rThis application concerns Austin House, a building comprising flats and an associated car parking area. \rThe site is situated on a prominent corner plot location and fronts onto Surbiton Hill Road to the east, St Mark's Hill to the south and south-west, Church Hill Road to the west and Avenue Elmers to the north-west.\r\rThe site is located within Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) 'S' and has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 5 (very good). There are a number of locally listed buildings neighbouring the site along Avenue Elmers, St Mark's Hill and Surbiton Hill Road.\r\rAustin House is a 1960's four storey purpose built mixed use block, including a flat roof and expressed concrete frame with alternating, horizontal hung clay tile and glazed infill panels. The original building was designed as two wings, meeting at a recessed corner, with two solid, brick 'book-ends' which terminate the horizontality of the alternating ribbons of cladding and window.\r\rThe proposal seeks permission for the following works:\rThe brickwork to the elevations is to be painted black;\rExisting white render panels to be made good and repainted;\rExisting spandrel panels to windows to be replaced with grey fiber cement rainscreen cladding; and,\rExisting entrance doors removed and replaced with new powder coated glazed entrance screens and doors.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign: \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed simple material palette is supported. Officers are cognisant that Class C of Part 2, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development (England) Order 2015 permits the painting of the exterior of any building or work. The only condition to this right is that the painting cannot be for the purpose of advertisement, announcement or direction. Class C defines \"painting\" to include the application of any colour. This is a fallback position that is material planning consideration and given significant weight in the determination of this application. Given the weight given to the fallback position, no objections can be raised with regards to the proposed painting of the building. The remaining alterations such as the grey fiber cement rainscreen cladding is considered to compliment the proposed black brickwork and repaired white render. The proposed entrance doors and screens would uplift the appearance of the building and improve the 'sense of arrival'. Overall, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an adverse impact to the character and appearance of the building or wider area.\r\rAmenity:\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities\rof the occupiers of the development, nor neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance,\rloss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r5 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a part two storey/part single storey side extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace housing.\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to erect a part two storey /part single storey side extension.\r\rAt ground floor level, the proposed side extension would be irregular in shape occupying the full area between the existing dwelling and the shared boundary with neighbouring no114 Cranborne Avenue. It would be set back from the front elevation presenting a width of 2.451m,  a depth of 5.56m to the rear building line where the new build would present an overall width of  4.113m.  Due to its irregular shape, the rear part of the proposed ground extension will be visible when viewed from the front of the dwelling . \r\rA flat roof is proposed for the ground floor side extension with an eaves height of 3.3m  and would present  EPDM Rubber Roofing \r\rIn addition to the above, the proposal  seeks approval for a first floor side extension which would have a smaller footprint to the proposed ground floor extension. It would have a proposed eave height of 2.2m.   \r\rThe pitched roof of the  proposed extension  would relate well to the main house and its roof form  and  it would be set down from that of the original house. \r\rIn terms  of proposed materials and finishes, it is noted that the proposed pitched roof would be present tiles to match the existing roof  and the proposed walls would comprise of brickwork  and rendered block  finished to closely match the existing.\r\rNo windows are proposed on the flank wall of the proposed side elevations of the extension.\r\rOfficers note the neighbouring no 114 Cranborne Avenue presents an existing rear single storey building / extension  which adjoins the main dwelling  and  is set back from the front elevation.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site  and with the neighbouring dwelling no 114 Cranborne Avenue, the siting of the part two storey and part single storey extension it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r",
    "Please amend the Site Location Plan to include all land associated with the site. It currently only includes the house itself.\r\rNote: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of 1:1250 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, car parking and open areas around buildings).\r",
    "Please clarify the proposal. Your Application Form states a change of use of the garage to a habitable room, but the submitted plans suggest that the existing garage is being replaced with a new garage structure. Please confirm and amend the proposal in the Application Form, or amend plans where necessary.",
    "The fee required for your planning application is £258.  Payment can be made online via the Kingston council website, or via our Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002."
