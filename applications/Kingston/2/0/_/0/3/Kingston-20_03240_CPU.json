    "The proposed single storey rear extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and the total enlargement would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, which would conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j)(iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "The Councils Highways Officer raised an objection to the submitted details in relation to Condition 6 (Construction Management Plan) for the following reasons:\r\rA review of the submitted CMP indicates some missing requisite information, which are highlighted below:\r\rA brief description of the construction methodology or overall construction programme for the proposed development has not been provided;\r\rThe procedure for loading/unloading of materials has not been sighted in the plan;\r\rAlthough a brief description of the construction vehicular traffic routing to the site has been provided, an accompanying map to describe the routing movements would be more appropriate;\r\rAccording to the plan, construction vehicles will be able to access and exit the site in a forward gear. However, swept path analysis details will be required to demonstrate how the construction vehicles will be undertaking these movements at the site access;\r\rA site layout plan will be required to show the location of all ancillary site buildings, including the materials storage area, plant and operatives vehicles;\r\rThe CMP has not provided information on the method of recycling and disposing of waste resulting from the demolition and construction phases;\r\rThe applicant should mention the measures that would be taken to encourage the use of local public transport and other sustainable travel modes to the construction site by its staff; and\r\rThe plan indicates that the front of the site will be utilised for parking by site operatives. This should be discouraged and the use of private vehicles to the site restricted.\r\rBased on the above comments, we wish to object to the application, pending when the listed missing requisite information have been incorporated and a revised Construction Management Plan submitted for Highways approval.",
