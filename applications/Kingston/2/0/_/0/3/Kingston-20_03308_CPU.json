    "The application described in the First Schedule is existing and therefore a certificate under section 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 cannot be granted. ",
    "It has not been demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the outbuilding falls within the parameters of permitted developement as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "If you have evidence to contradict the local planning authority's assessment of the application, you are encouraged to apply for the development again and include that evidence in support of the application.",
    "To confirm that your application submission includes all the necessary documentation as required by the Validation Local List please complete and submit the \"Validation Checklist - Section 3\" document. Please note the specific additional requirements listed below.\rThe Validation Local List and Checklist can be found on the council's website: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\r",
    "The Site Location Plan red line must include land necessary to carry out the proposed development. Please amend the 1:1250 Site Location Plan to include land required for access to the site from the public highway. There must be only one red line to outline the site boundary and it cannot be fragmented into parts. For clarity please amend the red line boundary and re-submit this plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a retail unit on the corner of Clarence Street and Church street and within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area lies in its historic status as an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period. It is close to the historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park and Richmond Park and the old core of the town around All Saints Church and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is the best preserved of its type in outer London.\r\rProposal\rRefurbishment of existing retail unit with new shop front and full shop fit-out on the ground floor and reconfiguration of the first and second floors into staff welfare, office and storage space with new external signage. For the avoidance of any doubt the description of development has been amended as follows: '(external signage subject to a separate Advertisement Consent Application)' to make clear that the proposed signage could only be considered as part of an Advertisement Consent application. \r\rIt is noted that this application relates only to the refurbishment of the site and that the proposed advertisements and signage are subject to a separate advert application so have not been considered as part of this application. A planning condition would be added to any consent to make clear that the signage requires a separate advertisement consent.\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rKingston CAAC - Objection - The fascia signage should not be backlit plastic. Any advertising above the shopfront eg at 1st floor level (DAS visuals refer) is in contravention of The Town & Country (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007 & the LPA's own guidance on development in CAs & should be refused\r\rRBK Heritage Officer - The proposed changes to the shopfront are acceptable. The original shopfront does not make a\rpositive contribution to the conservation area, and a replacement limestone finish is proposed. \r\rProposed signage and advertising\rThe proposed signage with illuminated letters is not supported. The letters should be ideally signpainted, or solid cut-out letters without illumination. A single projecting blade sign is acceptable, but this must not be internally illuminated.\rFilm advertisements are not supported, particularly to the large first floor windows facing Church Street. The glazing to this windows should not be removed; curtains may be used internally as screening if required.\r\rThe heritage officer has also recommended conditions should permission be grated relating to the proposed signage.\r\rAs noted above, the proposed signage would be subject to a seperate advertisment consent and has not been assessed as part of this application.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that this site was previously subject to a lot of signage and adverts that were wholly inappropriate in a conservation area. The propose return of the site to a replacement limestone finish would greatly improve the site as a whole.  Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 205-214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
