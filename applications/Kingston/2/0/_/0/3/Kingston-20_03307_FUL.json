    "Condition 4 (Detailed Drawings) of planning permission 22/02235/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of any development above ground level, detailed drawings at a scale of 1:5, 1:10 or 1:20 (as applicable) of the following features shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority:\r\r- 1:5/1:10 details (plan/section/elevation) of all external windows, doors, railings\r- 1:20 typical bay and central glazed (front and rear) elevation, annotated with all materials\r- Details of external lighting\r- Details of boundary treatments (wall, gates, fences etc), including details of manufacturing specification\r- Details of landscaping materials, including product details\r- Details of PV panels\r\rThe development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved drawings.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\rOfficer comment: The submitted details for the discharge of Condition 4 (Detailed Drawings) have been assessed as follows:\r\r- The submitted elevations show proposed materials; this is unacceptable as the applicant has submitted the same materials under refused planning application ref: 24/01665/CLC for the discharge of Condition 3 (Materials). The proposed materials have implications for the technical details required by Condition 4.\r\r- The submitted details show changes to the design of the proposed dormers and the main roof of the dwelling. The proposed changes to the scheme cannot be achieved through a discharge of condition application. The applicant would need to formally amend the original planning permission by way  of a Section 73 (minor material amendment) application or a Section 96a (non-material amendment application), depending on the scale of the proposed changes. In addition, Officers note the change of material of the dormers from timber to metal without any contextual analysis within the Conservation Area and it is therefore unclear whether the chosen material would preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.\r\r- The details of external lighting, hard landscaping materials, boundary treatments and PV panels are considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rFor the reasons stated above, the submitted details for the discharge of Condition 4 (Detailed Drawings) would be considered unacceptable.",

    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Highfield Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of an existing detached garage, erection of part two storey/part single storey side, single storey rear and front porch extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony, installation of 5nos front rooflights.\r\rOfficers note that permission for the same proposal was granted under application 21/03858/HOU and this permission does not expire until 31.03.2025.\r\rRelevant History\r21/03101/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (4.32m in depth, maximum height of 3.18m and eaves height of 2.20m). Prior Approval Granted on 05 Nov 2021. With conditions.\r\r21/03090/CPU - Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions (with juliet balcony) and installation of 4no. rooflights to front roofslope. Application Granted on 26 Nov 2021.\r\r21/03858/HOU - Demolition of existing detached garage, erection of two storey side, single storey rear and front porch extension. Erection of hip to gable roof extension including rear dormer and juliet balcony, installation of 5 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Application Granted on 31.03.2022\r\rConsultations\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 letters of objection have been received stating;\r - Effects on trees\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\rThe impact of the development on highways; and; \rFire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a hip to gable roof extension, a flat roof rear dormer extension with a juliet balcony to the rear roofslope, as well as the construction of a single storey rear extension. Whilst these three elements would not strictly conform to the guidance outlined in the Residential Design SPD, it is proposed that these elements would be constructed under the respective, previously approved applications, 21/03090/CPU for the roof alterations and 21/03101/PAEXT for the single storey rear. Due to the fallback position that these elements can be constructed under permitted development rights, Officers consider that these elements would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a two storey side extension. Whilst this element would not be set down from the ridgeline by 500mm as required by the Residential Design SPD, the proposed two-storey side extension would be set back sufficiently from the front elevation of the dwellinghouse, and would be set in from the side boundary by 1 metre at first floor level to avoid a terracing effect, and would not exceed 50% of the width of the original dwellinghouse. Additionally the features of the proposed side extension relate well to the dwellinghouse and line of the eaves is maintained. Officers therefore consider that the proposed two storey side extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey front extension to facilitate a porch, as well as an extension to the garage. The proposed porch area is considered to relate well to the main property and would appear subordinate to the dwellinghouse. Similarly the proposed extension to the garage would not be an uncharacteristic form of development, as seen at the adjoining property at No. 11 Highfield Road. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are Nos. 7 and 11 Highfield Road. In relation to No. 7 Highfield Road, due to the siting of the proposed development, as well as the siting of this neighbouring dwelling house in relation to the application site, officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a significant loss of sunlight to any habitable room. Furthermore the application proposes to install three windows on the side elevation facing this neighbouring property, however these would be obscure glazed, and as such the proposed development would not result in a loss of privacy. It is also considered that the proposed development would not have an overbearing impact on the neighbouring property at No. 7 Highfield Road. \r\rIn relation to No. 11 Highfield Road, the application proposes a single storey rear extension on the boundary with this neighbouring property. Whilst it is noted that No. 11 Highfield Road does not benefit from a rear extension, due to the height of the proposed single storey rear, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a loss of sunlight to the closest habitable room window. It is noted that a 45 degree drawing has been submitted but is unfortunatly incorrectly drawn, however, officers have assessed the impact in accordance with BRE guidance and are satified that the chamfered roof form would comply with the 45 degree rule. Furthermore as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, the proposed development would not result in a loss of privacy to No. 11 Highfield Road. Similarly it is also considered that the proposed development would not have an overbearing impact on the neighbouring property at No. 11 Highfield Road. The proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties. \r\rOfficers acknowledge the objections received but as noted above no harm has been identified.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a new garage to replace an existing garage. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. Both the existing and proposed garages would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore this element of the development would not impact the parking provision on site. \r\rThe application also proposes a front extension, resulting in a loss of an area of hardstanding. Despite the part loss of this hardstanding, it is considered that the remaining hardstanding is of an adequate size to accommodate two off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue would not warrant a reason for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the proposed garage would not be suitable to accommodate a modern day vehicle, the proposed space is of an adequate size to accommodate cycle parking in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, in line with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling within the Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of single storey rear extension and erection of single storey rear extension, floor plan redesign and all associated works\r\rOfficers note a previous application 24/00854/HOU dated 31.05.2024 for the demolition of single storey rear extension and erection of single storey rear/side infill extension, floor plan redesign and all associated works was refused for the following reason;\r\r1) The proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of neighbouring property No. 27 Victoria Road as it would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the principle window of the nearest ground floor habitable room, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rThis reason for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring propoerties have been notified and no representation have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Flood Risk; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area or the local area of special character as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers note that the proposed rear extension would now be set in 1m from the boundary with No. 27 Victoria Road. Officers therefore consider that the original reason for refusal has been addressed and the proposed development would no longer result in an unacceptable loss of outlook for the closest habitable room window at neighbouring No. 27 Victoria Road, or result in undue sense of enclosure.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Condition 5 (Sustainable Urban Drainage Design Strategy and Assessment Report) of planning permission ref 24/00672/FUL states:\r\rPrior to commencement of groundworks (excluding site investigations and demolition), a final detailed drainage design, including drawings, supporting calculations, SuDS Statement and Drainage Assessment Form shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. A detailed management plan confirming routine maintenance tasks for all drainage components must also be submitted to demonstrate how the drainage system is to be maintained for the lifetime of the development. The system shall be implemented and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r \rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021, the Sustainable Design and Construction SPG 2014, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems 2015 and policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer Comment: The RBK's Flood Risk Officer has objected to the proposal for the following reasons:\r\r'The LLFA do not recommend the discharge of this condition because the discharge point for the proposed drainage system needs to be secured to demonstrate that the system is viable. Also, the invert levels of the proposed manhole needs to be confirmed to\rdemonstrate that the drainage system can drain via gravity as it's currently proposed. Finally, floatation calculations should be provided to demonstrate that the proposed underground tanks would not float due to high groundwater levels.'\r\rAs such, it is considered that insufficient information has been provided to prevent the risk of flooding to and from the site, contrary to policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021, the Sustainable Design and Construction SPG 2014, the Non-Statutory Technical Standards for Sustainable Drainage Systems 2015 and policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) provided by the Environment Agency shows that\rthe site lies in an area of very low risk of surface water flooding (meaning there is less than 0.1% likelihood of flooding occurring in a given year). An online version of this mapping data is available to view through the Environment Agency's Long term flood risk information mapping.\r\rThe applicant proposes to discharge surface water at the Thames Water surface water sewer at a restricted rate of 1 l/s. As required, the applicant has provided a geotechnical ground investigation report to justify not discharging surface water via infiltration in compliance to the drainage hierarchy citing site geology and high groundwater conditions. SuDS in the form of attenuation tanks, permeable block paving and a water butt is being proposed to attenuate flow. A hydrobrake control device is incorporated to restrict discharge rates to proposed rates.\r\rAs required, drainage calculations that demonstrate that the proposed drainage system can\rcontain up to the 1 in 30 year storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event can be safely contained on site has been provided. Total impermeable site area (0.027 ha) has been modelled. Proposed Storage volume (9.12 m3) is equivalent to what is required.\r\rA sustainable drainage layout has been provided, to show the location of the proposed components and the connectivity of the system. The layout as required also shows pipe numbers, gradients and pipe sizes complete. However, the proposed discharge point (via a manhole on a neighbouring site) has not been secured as permission from the land owner is required. Additionally, the invert level of the proposed manhole has not been confirmed to show that the drainage system can drain via gravity as is currently proposed. The LLFA needs confirmation that the discharge point for the proposed drainage system has been secured to demonstrate that the system is viable. Also, all drawings need to be marked as final. Where permission has been secured to connect to the proposed manhole as mentioned above, the invert levels of the manhole should be confirmed. Additionally, due to the recorded high groundwater levels, floatation calculations will be required, as high ground levels can create a risk of the underground attenuation being floated. These calculations should be either informed by observed groundwater levels (over the winter period) or calculated based on groundwater being at surface level.\r\rAs required, a maintenance plan has been provided to include what maintenance tasks will be completed, and how often the maintenance tasks will be completed. We assumed that the homeowner will be responsible for undertaking maintenance of the proposed drainage system.\r\rThe LLFA do not recommend the discharge of this condition because the discharge point for the proposed drainage system needs to be secured to demonstrate that the system is viable. Also, the invert levels of the proposed manhole needs to be confirmed to demonstrate that the drainage system can drain via gravity as it's currently proposed. Finally, floatation calculations should be provided to demonstrate that the proposed underground tanks would not float due to high groundwater levels.\r"
