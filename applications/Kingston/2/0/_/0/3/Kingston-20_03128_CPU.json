    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling. The site is located within the Tudor Estate, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed roof extension would respect the materials used for the existing dwelling and would follow the existing roof line. However, the proposed gable-end would not comply with paragraph 4.29, of the Residential Design SPD, which states Proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This is true in this case, as this would upset the visual balance of the row of terrace properties. Additionally, as the property sits on a corner plot (corner of Lancaster Gardens and Aragon Road) this addition would be highly visible and bulky within the street scene.\r\rThe applicant also proposes to introduce a dormer that would extend nearly the full width of the roof on top of the previously granted two-storey side/rear extension (planning permission ref: 11/12773/HOU). This would further add visual bulk to this corner plot and would be highly visible in the streetscene. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, massing, materials and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 216 of the NPPF 2024 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would not generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD and would significantly detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would result in significant harm to the Tudor Estate, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
