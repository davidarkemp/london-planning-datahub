    "By reason of the application's submission date of 8 December 2020 and expiry date of 6 January 2021, the proposal is considered not to benefit from the legislation and would conflict with Part 3, Section 17, Paragraph 12 of Section 93B of the Business and Planning Act 2020.\r",
    "Condition 3 (Materials) of planning permission 22/03096/HOU  states: \rNotwithstanding the submitted information in relation to facing materials, prior to the carrying out of any above ground works, other than demolition, details of the facing materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rWhile the proposed brick and roof tiles are considered to be acceptable, no details of the proposed aluminium cladding and capping has been submitted so officers are unable to assess how the proposed facing material would relate to the character and appearance of the host building and the conservation area. \r\rAs such it is considered that insufficient information has been submitted to discharge condition 3. \r",
