    "The proposed extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rPlanning application Ref: 23/00367/NMA was refused for the following reason:\rThe proposed roof would contradict with Condition 4 of the planning permission, which restricts the use of the flat roof, therefore, the Council considers the amendments not to be non-material and as such, the application is refused.\r\rThe applicant has now submitted an amended non-material application which ommits the access to the roof.\r\rThis application seeks to:\r\r- Alterations to fenestrations to west elevation.\r- Alteration of the proposed finish to flat roof at rear by reduction of area of planters and changes to rooflight\r- Alteration of the material of the proposed rear windows from wood to conservation style aluminium with similar finish.\r- New elevated planters at ground and lower ground floor to avoid the erection of safety rails add  window to side elevation.\r\rThe Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent. This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
