    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the submitted application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The rooflights in the development to which this permission relates shall be of a conservation style, constructed in timber and set flush with the plane of the roof in which they are inserted. The rooflights shall be permanently retained in this style. \r\rReason: To prevent harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, in accordance with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The largest of the proposed conservation area style rooflights, situated within the rear of the main roof pitch and in closest proximity to the shared boundary with No. 21 Bellevue Road, shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above the finished floor level of the top step (in relation to the stairs to the second floor) shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling on Rollesby Road.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 22/00892/HOU - Demolition of existing garage and erection of two storey side and single storey rear and front porch extension. Granted on 18.02.2022.\r- 21/00119/PAEXT- Erection of single storey rear extension (4.00 in depth, maximum height of 2.65m and eaves height of 2.65m). Granted on 17 Feb 2021.\r- 20/03120/CPU - Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope. Granted on 24 May 2021.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant is seeking approval for the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, the erection of a single-storey front porch, rear extension and a first-floor side and rear extension. Along with the erection of a hip-to-gable roof extension with a rear dormer and the installation of 2no front rooflights.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that most of the works proposed in this application have been granted through previous planning permission. The proposed 4m deep single-storey rear extension was granted through planning permission ref: 21/00119/PAEXT, the proposed hip-to-gable and dormer was granted through planning permission ref: 20/03120/CPU, and the proposed conversion of the garage and erection of a first-floor side extension along with a front porch was granted through planning permission ref: 22/00892/HOU. Therefore, the only element of this development that has not been previously assessed is the proposed first-floor rear extension.\r\rThe applicant is informed that while officers note the fallback position of specific aspects of this development, the assessment will take into account all aspects of this proposal as a whole using relevant guidance. \r\rPolicy Guidance 39, of the Residential Design SPD states that proposed dormers should maintain a minimum of 500mm distance from the eaves, sides and ridge. Although this has not been demonstrated in the submitted details, officers recognised the fallback position of granted through ref: 23/03120/CPU. This can also be said for the proposed hip-to-gable extension.\r\rProposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. In this case, this would off-balance the row of terraced property, as No. 110 does not benefit from a hip-to-gable on the original roof. However, as mentioned above, officers acknowledge the fallback position granted through ref: 23/03120/CPU\r\rThe proposed first-floor side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm, officers note that it would be designed to respect the character of the original dwelling, and would appear modest in scale, and as such would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. \r\rThe proposed first-floor rear extension would sit on top of a 4m deep rear extension but would only have a depth of approximately 3m (including eaves) and it would maintain a separation distance of approximately 3m from neighbouring property No. 114 Rollesby Road. It is noted that it would appear slightly bulky, however, the applicant has incorporated a pitched roof and matching material to reduce the impact on the character and appearance of the area. Additionally, this aspect would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rThe proposed porch is considered to relate well to the main property and would generally follow the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD. \r\rOverall, officers consider that on balance there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.  \r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed development may appear extensive, however, the site layout has scope for larger development due to the spaciousness of the plot. In relation to neighbouring properties No.118 Rollesby Road, the proposed two-storey side extension and first-floor rear would pass the BRE 45-degree rule, as the two-storey side and first-floor rear extensions would maintain approximately 3m from the closest habitable room at No.118 Rollesby Road.\r\rRegarding No. 114 Rollesby Road, the proposed single-storey rear and first-floor rear extension would also not breach the BRE rule, therefore, the would be no significant loss of light as a result of the proposed development on No.114.\r\rThe applicant proposes to install windows on the side elevations at the first-floor level facing neighbouring property No.114 Rollesby Road, as such, in the event of approval, an obscure glazing and non-openable condition was put in place to prevent overlooking.\r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the existing garage's small dimensions it would not be able to safely accommodate on-site car parking and would not comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. As such, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site. Furthermore, the hardstanding trail to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. However, the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted and approved. \r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "PLease provide a Site Location Plan that meets the following requirements: A Site Location Plan must be at a scale of either 1:1250 or 1:2500 which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, car parking and open areas around buildings).\r"
