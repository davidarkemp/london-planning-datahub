    "No demolition or development, other than demolition to top of slab level, shall take place until a stage 1 written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, and the programme and methodology of site evaluation and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.\r\rIf heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 then for those  parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be  submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that  is included within the stage 2 WSI, no demolition/development shall take place  other than in accordance with the agreed stage 2 WSI which shall include: \rA. The statement of significance and research objectives, the  \rprogramme and methodology of site investigation and recording and  the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake  the agreed works \rB. Where appropriate, details of a programme for delivering related  positive public benefits. \rC.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a locally listed, detached dwelling located within the Claremont Road Conservation Area. A tree in the front garden is subject to Tree Preservation Order. \r\rProposal \rErection of ground floor side and rear extension, first floor rear extension, and installation of gate along front boundary.\r\rConsultations\r34 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \rSurbiton Neighbourhood conservation Area Advisory Committee - no objections\rTree Officer - no objections\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Claremont Road Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed two storey rear extension would be approximately 3.2m deep (similar depth to the existing rear projection). I would have similar eaves height, design and materials as the existing dwelling. Given that the application is for detached property and considering its design, siting and the size of the plot, it is considered that the proposed two storey rear extension element of the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, in accordance with Policy Guidance 34 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe proposed single storey side extension to connect the existing outbuilding with the main house would be set from the front elevation by approximately 6m. Given its proposed design, the roof form (double pitched roof to match the existing one) and scale (the total height of approximately 3.9m) is considered to relate well to the host dwelling and the surrounding area, in accordance with  Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe installation of the proposed gate which would be of similar design and height as the existing front boundary is considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed metal cycle storage, given its scale and siting is considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the surrounding area.  \r\rThe proposal, due to its siting, would not be immediately visible within the street view. Given the proposed scale, design and high quality materials, it is considered that it would not have a significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: the application site falls within the Claremont Road Conservation Area.\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: Part of the original Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley. Development started in 1838, and centred around the landscaped Claremont Crescent Gardens.\r\rThe proposed development, due to its siting, would not be immediately visible from the public vantage points. Due to its modest scale, the proposed design and high quality materials, it is considered that it would be in-keeping with the host dwelling, therefore the proposed development would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property comprises a locally listed building which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the conservation area . It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to this non-designated heritage asset.\r\rProtected Trees\rGiven the siting and nature of the proposal it is considered that the proposed development would not result in unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the surrounding trees. It is noted that the Tree and Landscape Officer raises no objections to the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The main dwellings to consider when assessing the impacts on neighbouring amenity are flats at Kingsley House, 34 Claremont Road and No 30 Claremont Road, mixed use building (Vet Hospital and residential use). \rIt is noted that the two storey rear element of the proposal would be set along the boundary with Kingsley House, however, due to the modest depth of the extension, siting of Kingsley House and no habitable openings to the side elevation at Kingsley House it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rWith regards to  No 30 Claremont Road, given the separation distance and scale, mass and bulk of the proposal, it is considered that it would not have an unacceptable impact on the amenities of the occupiers at No 30. \r\rOfficers note enlarged openings and the proposed Juliet balcony to the first floor rear elevation, however, given the separation distance of approximately 42m to the nearest habitable openings to the rear (Nos 5 and 7 Adele Road), it is considered that the proposal would not result in an undue overlooking or loss of privacy in relation to these properties. \r\rHighway Safety\r\rThe proposed gates would be electronically operated and therefore would ensure that there would be very limited waiting on the pavement and the driver would not need to leave the vehicle to manually open gates. The gates comprise metal bars without a solid backing which would allow intervisibility in and out of the site and as such the proposal would not compromise highway safety.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which is considered to be acceptable.  The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Statement hereby approved and and thereafter maintained.\r \rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The submitted site plan is not labelled as existing or proposed.\rPlease provide existing and proposed site plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The site plan should show all public rights of way crossing or adjoining the site and should also show access arrangements, all trees and hedges within the application site and on the boundary, including trees and hedges on neighbouring land.  The plan should be annotated with key measurements, including distances to boundaries. The plan(s) must be given a unique drawing number and be clearly labelled as Existing or Proposed Site Plan. The Site Plan must show the direction of North"
