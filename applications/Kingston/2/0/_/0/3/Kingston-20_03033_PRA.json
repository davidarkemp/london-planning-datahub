    "No demolition or development, other than demolition to top of slab level, shall take place until a stage 1 written scheme of investigation (WSI) has been submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the WSI, no demolition or development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed WSI, and the programme and methodology of site evaluation and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.\r\rIf heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 then for those  parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be  submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that  is included within the stage 2 WSI, no demolition/development shall take place  other than in accordance with the agreed stage 2 WSI which shall include: \rA. The statement of significance and research objectives, the  \rprogramme and methodology of site investigation and recording and  the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake  the agreed works \rB. Where appropriate, details of a programme for delivering related  positive public benefits. \rC. The programme for post-investigation assessment and  \rsubsequent analysis, publication & dissemination and deposition of  resulting material. this part of the condition shall not be discharged  until these elements have been fulfilled in accordance with the  \rprogramme set out in the stage 2 WSI. \r\rReason: This pre-commencement condition is necessary to safeguard the archaeological  interest on this site. Approval of the WSI before works begin on site provides  clarity on what investigations are required, and their timing in relation to the  development programme. If the applicant does not agree to this pre commencement condition please let us know their reasons and any alternatives  suggested. Without this pre-commencement condition being imposed the  application should be refused as it would not comply with NPPF paragraph 199.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is a detached bungalow located on Edgecoombe Close. The site is subject to a blanket TPO area, is situated within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, as well as an Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rProposal\rConversion of existing garage into a habitable space, erection of roof extension with front and rear dormer.\r\rIt is noted that this application follows a previously refused application 22/01287/HOU dated 19.07.2022 for the remodelling and extension to existing dwelling, including raising of roof height at first floor level, erection of single storey extension to front/side, external alterations and associated landscaping which was refused for the following reason;\r\r1) The proposed removal of the significant sized and historically well managed Tree Preservation Order trees, without proper justification, is unacceptable, would harm the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and, and as such the proposal would conflict with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe scheme has been amended significantly so will be assesed in full. It is also noted that supporting tree reports have been submitted with this application.\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received\r\rTree officer:  The proposals do not appear possible without the removal of 2 large mature Cat B TPO trees at a minimum and given that they have not provided an Arboricultural method Statement or Tree Protection Plan, which we would have to have prior to determination, my recommendation is for refusal.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on trees. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rNon-designated heritage asset\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rThe Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough.\r \rDue to the limited height and depth of the proposed development it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. However, it is considered that any harm to, or loss of trees protected by a TPO as a result of the development would not be acceptable and would harm the overall character and appearance of the area. \r\rThere would be no harm to the Area of Archaeological Significance as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application does not include the removal of trees covered under a TPO, however, RBK Tree and Landscape officer would need further clarification by the submission of  an Arboricultural method Statement or Tree Protection Plan prior to determination to ensure their protection. The applicant is reminded that there is no justification given for their removal and the removal of such significant Cat B protected trees is totally unacceptable simply to facilitate any development much less that of a small residential dwelling and the conclusion must be one of outright refusal.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
