    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r5 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  1 letter of support  and requesting a control over construction received and states : \rNoise \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a rear dormer roof extension, side extension to existing hipped roof and installation of 3nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises  a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r20/02448/CPU - Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2 no front rooflights and 1 no side gable window to facilitate loft conversion. Granted 26.11.20\r\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a rear dormer roof extension, side extension to existing hipped roof and installation of 3nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion .  \r\rThe existing dwelling presents  a hipped roof which has a roof ridge height of  8.871m and a ridge length  of 2.239m.The dwelling also has a two storey side extension with a flat roof height of 5.512m.\r\rThe proposal seeks to extend the existing hipped roof  sideways in order to provide a single hipped roof  to include the existing side extension of the dwelling. The principle of development as it would improve the overall  aesthetic appearance of the  dwelling roof form. \r\rOfficers have reviewed the  submitted existing and proposed drawings and note there  are some discrepancies. \r\rIn order to provide a single hipped roof arrangement providing coverage over the dwelling side extension, the roof ridge length would extend to 5.74m. Consequently,   Officers note there would be a 10 degree angle difference in the pitch slope and there would be an increase in the roof ridge height  from 8.932m to 9.178m. This has not been addressed in the description of development.   In reviewing  the proposed front elevation drawing and the proposed roof plan, Officers note there is an inconsistency in the depth of the pitch  i.e from junction of the ridge to the edge of the slope.  The proposed front elevation presents a depth of 3m whereas the proposed roof plan presents a depth of 2.836m .\r\rThe proposal also seeks approval  for the erection of a rear dormer extension. Policy Guidance 39 recommends proposed dormers should be set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm and set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm. In this instance, the proposed dormer would protrude beyond the edge of the new roofslope and  be clearly visible from the streetscene.  Officers consider the   proposal would not complement the character of the host dwelling  house nor of the wider area.  In addition, the positioning of the proposed dormer on the rear roof slope would result in the loss of the existing pitch roof feature on the rear elevation.The proposal would also result in the loss of the existing pitch roof feature on the rear elevation.   \rIn addition to the above, it is noted the proposed extensions would facilitate a loft conversion and to serve this habitable space 3nos rooflights are proposed on the front roofslope.  \r\rOfficers note both the proposed roof extension and the dormer would be clad in brown red plain clay tile. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale,form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\r\r",
