    "The proposal would involve the loss of an existing retail store (Use Class E) and employment use at the site. No robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the premises has been actively marketed, and that the existing use or an alternative employment use is no longer viable. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policies DM17 and DM19 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would discourage the use of sustainable modes of transport through the relative overprovision of on-site car parking spaces in this particular location. Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that vehicles would be able to access and egress the site, for the purposes of utilising the proposed 3 on-site car parking spaces, in a forward gear which could pose highway safety issues, contrary to Policies T6, T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide an acceptable level of private amenity space for future residents of the properties. The amenity space would be readily visible within the streetscene and a lack of appropriate boundary treatment would not afford residents any privacy, which would be to the detriment of their enjoyment of the property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).",

    "There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The local planning authority must be satisfied that the amendment sought is non-material in order to grant an application under section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\rThe applicant seeks to amend the wording of condition 57 of planning permission ref no 20/02942/FUL to change the trigger for submission of details relating to the signage and wayfinding strategy. As the amended wording would not materially affect or change the approved development, the proposed amendment is considered to be non material.\r",
    "The Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent. This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non-material amendment to planning permission ref 22/01359/FUL which was granted on 24.08.2023. The proposed amendments would see the rewording of Condition 2 (Approved Plans) to reflect proposed design revisions, including: \r\r- a new canopy to the south elevation of Block A at the entrance door; and \r- reduction in the pitch of the roof on Block A. \r\rNo changes are proposed to Block B or the ridge height of Block A.\r\rThis application is a resubmission following the refusal of a previous NMA (24/01818/NMA). The submitted Cover Letter confirms the proposed changes \rfocus on improving building safety for maintenance personnel and ensuring compliance with wheelchair standards at ground floor level. \r\rSimilarly to the previous NMA, Officers raise no objection to the proposed new solid canopy on Block A. No details have been provided on the proposed materials. Officers would accept the canopy to be constructed of the same metalwork material as the soffits to the balcony. This detail would be secured by condition. \r\rThe previous NMA proposed a flattening of the approved pitched roof on Block A whilst retaining the parapet roof ends which was not supported by Council's Urban Design Officer on the basis that it would be visually jarring with the building's architectural quality. The proposed scheme now aims to reduce the pitch of the roof from 16 to 13 degrees. Officers consider the proposed roof design to now be supportable as it would be sympathetic to the form of the approved building, in compliance with Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), Policy D4 of the London Plan (2021), and Policy CS8 and DM10 of Kingston's Core Strategy (2012). \r\rParagraph 140 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2023) states local planning authorities should seek to ensure that the quality of approved development is not materially diminished between permission and completion, as a result of changes being made to the permitted scheme. \r\rThe proposed amendments would not materially diminish the quality of the approved development in terms of design quality. As such, Officers consider the amendments to be non-material and it is recommended the S96A application be approved."
