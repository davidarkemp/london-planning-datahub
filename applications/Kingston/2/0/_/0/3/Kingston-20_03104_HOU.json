    "The change of use of the existing garage would result in the loss of available space for the secure and convenient parking of bicycles. The proposed development does not make provision for replacement cycle parking and the plans submitted do not demonstrate that sufficient space would be provided to secure the provision of safe and secure cycle lockers. As a result, the proposed development would not realise the opportunities to promote cycling and encourage the uptake of sustainable modes of transport. The development is therefore contrary to Policies in the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, and  Policy DM8 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Erection of a rear dormer roof extension in the existing loft and installation of 3nos front rooflights. Conversion of an existing flat into 2nos 1-bed flats.'"
