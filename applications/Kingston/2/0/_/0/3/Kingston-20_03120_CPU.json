    "The proposed hip-to-gable, dormer and rooflights are considered to fall within the parameters of Classes B and C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would be lawful.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling with the 2.8 Old Malden, Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received in support of the submitted details, however, it raises concern regarding party wall agreements. The applicant has submitted a Certificate B (Certificate of Ownership) giving notice to the relevant neighbouring property. Matters such as Party Wall agreements and subsidence are not material planning considerations. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposed single-storey rear/side extension would have a depth of approximately 2.3m from the rear elevation with a flat roof height of approximately 3m, falling in line with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD. Whilst the extension would be visible from the streetscene, it would maintain approximately 500m from the front wall and appear subordinate and appropriate to the host dwelling. Additionally, officers acknowledge that development of this type is not odd in the vicinity of Stroudes Close.\r\rThe proposed front porch would have a similar width and depth to the existing porch. Additionally, officers acknowledge that it would not have a similar pitched roof style as the main roof of the dwelling, however, it would still appear small in scale and subordinate to the host dwelling. \r\rOverall, officers consider that there would not be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\r\rOfficers Comments: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 216 of the NPPF 2024 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: In relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies a small footprint to the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
