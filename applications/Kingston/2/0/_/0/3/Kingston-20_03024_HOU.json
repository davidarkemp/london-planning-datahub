    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the first floor windows in the Southern elevation and situated on the first floor (subject of this permission) shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted convenient, safe and secure cycle parking provision shall have been provided in accordance with details which have previously been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: The development hereby permitted would prevent access to the rear garden and thus available space for the parking of cycles. The condition would ensure alternative provision of adequate cycle parking is identified and thereby realise the opportunities to promote cycling and encourage the uptake of sustainable modes of transport in accordance with Policies in the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016, and  Policy DM8 of the Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling on Park Road.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r- 22/03747/HOU. Erection of single storey rear/side extension and alteration to first floor rear roof. Refused on 02.02.2023 for the following reasons:\r\r1. By reason of height, siting, and design, the proposed first floor extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwellinghouse and would appear incongruous from the wider area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Guidance 2012.\r\r2. By reason of height, depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of No. 30 Park Road by reason of overbearing appearance and could lead to a significant loss of sunlight to adjoining garden (no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the impact) and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The applicant previously submitted a proposal under planning application ref: 22/03747/HOU which proposed the replacement of the first floor pitched roof with a flat roof, which would not fall in line with Policy Guidance 34 which states that flat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building. Therefore, the flat roof addition would be incongruous to the wider area and would not be an attractive addition to the host dwelling.\r\rThe applicant has now submitted an amended proposed proposal with a pitched roof which better suits the host dwelling and the wider area. \r\rIn regard to the proposed single storey side/rear extension the applicant has amended the proposal to consist of a pitched roof rather than a flat roof (2.9m). The amended extension would have a total pitched roof height of approximately 3.4m with an eave height of approximately 2.4m and a depth of 2.6m when measured from the original outrigger and a total depth of 5.7m, therefore it would generally follow the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33.\r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and that the development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Planning application ref: 22/03747/HOU was refused for the following reason:\r\rBy reason of height, depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of No. 30 Park Road by reason of overbearing appearance and could lead to a significant loss of sunlight to adjoining garden (no evidence has been submitted to demonstrate the impact) and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting of the proposed rear/side extension and the first floor extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rThe applicant has sufficiently addressed the concerns raised in the previously refused application by reducing the eaves height of the proposed single storey rear/side extension to approximately 2.4m on the boundary shared with neighbouring property No.30 Park Road. Additionally, the proposal consists of a pitched roof at first floor level, minimising the overbearing element of the development.  \r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would generally be in keeping with the guidance within the Residential Design SPD and would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, rather than preserve it. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would result in any harm to Princes Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Condition 9 (Bats and Artificial Lighting) of planning permission 23/00180/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the installation of any external artificial lighting on the development hereby approved, a scheme that must be in accordance with the requirements set out within the Bat Conservation Trust Guidelines - Guidance Note 8 - Bats and Artificial Lighting, must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval in writing. The lighting must be installed in accordance with the approved scheme and thereafter retained in accordance with the approved details. \r\rReason: To minimise the impact of the development on bats and their habitat in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021). \r\rOfficer response: The submitted Exterior Lighting Survey, Design & Calculation Report dated 01.08.2023  is considered to be sufficient. As such, details submitted in relation to Condition 9 (Bats and Artificial Lighting) are hereby approved.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed site plan as mention in the checklist drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The site plan should show all public rights of way crossing or adjoining the site and should also show access arrangements, all trees and hedges within the application site and on the boundary, including trees and hedges on neighbouring land.  The plan should be annotated with key measurements, including distances to boundaries. The plan(s) must be given a unique drawing number and be clearly labelled as Existing or Proposed Site Plan. The Site Plan must show the direction of North.",
