    "The proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of No. 198 Canbury Park Road in terms of loss of outlook and the creation of an undue sense of enclosure, due to its depth and proximity to the shared boundary. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
