    "The proposed development would fall within the parameters of Classes B, C and G of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would be lawful.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSite Constraints \r- Riverside South Conservation Area,  \r- Kingston Town Centre, Area of Archaeological Significance\r- 2.5 Coombe Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance\r- Thames - Side, Strategic Area of Special Character \r\rConsultations\r- 4 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r- Kington Town Conservation Area Advice Committee - No comment received.\r\rAssessment\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have an additional depth of approximately 3m from the existing rear extension and 4.2m on the boundary shared with No.22. Whilst the proposed depth would fall outside the SPD Guidelines, the drawings demonstrate that the flat roof would be at a height of approximately 3m, in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the residential Design SPD. Additionally, the extension would not be visible in the streetscene and would appear subordinate and proportionate to the main dwelling.\r \rTherefore, the proposal would not harm the character or appearance of the area but rather preserve it. As such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF (2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as:- A linear area forming the setting to Hampton Court Park, along the Portsmouth Road and the River Thames, containing fine examples of Victorian public works at Queen's Promenade, Seething Wells Water Works and many 19th century buildings of architectural interest.\r\rAs previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in general keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers concluded that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Riverside South Conservation Area or the Thames - Side, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Areas, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies a similar footprint to the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which does not sufficiently set out which policy criteria is not relevant to the development and why. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
