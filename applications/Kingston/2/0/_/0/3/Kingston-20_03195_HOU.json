    "The proposed development by virtue of the proposed bulk, form, design and materiality would result in an incongruous addition to the rear elevation which would not be in keeping with the host property or the surrounding area as a non-designated heritage asset, resulting in a jarring, discordant feature to the host dwellinghouse. The proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of Paragraphs 103 and 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS8, Policy DM10 and Policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in a materially harmful impact to the amenities afforded to each adjoining neighbouring residential dwelling in terms of visual dominance, sense of overbearing and loss of privacy. The proposal is therefore contrary to the provisions of Paragraph 130 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
