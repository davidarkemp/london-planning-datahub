  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development would result in an excessively bulky, disproportionate and incongruous addition that would not relate well to the host dwelling and would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of  the streetscene and the immediate surrounding area. It would also result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012."
