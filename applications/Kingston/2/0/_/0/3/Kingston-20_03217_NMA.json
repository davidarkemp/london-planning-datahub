    "The Council considers the proposed amendments to be material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment is refused.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a detached dwellinghouse positioned on Durlston Road, Kingston upon Thames.\r\rThe surrounding properties comprise predominantly of two storey  detached and semi detached dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise  a statutory or locally listed building.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of conservatory and erection of a single storey rear extension, outbuilding and piggy back roof extension with the installation of no.1 front and 2 nos. side roof lights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations were received in support or in objection to the proposals.\r\rPlanning History\rDC32064  - Alterations in connection with the demolition of coal store at the rear. Granted 24.11.86\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment : The  application proposes the demolition of a conservatory and erection of a single storey rear extension, outbuilding and piggy back roof extension with the installation of no.1 front and 2 nos. side rooflights. Each of these proposed elements are considered in turn below.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) of the Residential Design  SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies:\r\r- If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased\r- In all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain\r- Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in height\r- Extensions with a flat roof should not exceed 3.3m in height\r- Extensions with a pitched roof should not exceed 4 m in height\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would measure a depth of 4.19m  from the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse and would extend the full width of the existing house at 7.04m. It is proposed that the extension would be constructed of brick to match the existing of the host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed roof of the single storey extension  would be partially flat accommodating 2 glass panels (800 x2000) and then present a single aspect  pitch roof.  The proposed roof would be covered with felt and slate tiles.The proposed frontage of the new extension would present new folding doors approx 4.6m wide  and 2.2m tall.\r\rOfficer Comment : This proposed extension  would not be visible within the streetscene, Officers consider this element of the  application would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rThe application also seeks the construction of a single storey low pitched  tiled roof outbuilding to be positioned  behind the existing garage and adjacent to the shared boundary with no19 Durlston Road. It would measure 3.995m in length, 2.345m wide, ridge height 3.078m  and outside wall height 2.461m.  It would be constructed in brick to match materials of the dwellinghouse and have a low pitch tiled roof. Sliding doors will be presented in the front elevation. It is proposed that this building will be used as a study.\r\rOfficers Comment : Officers consider this proposed outbuilding  would be proportionate and subordinate in relation to the host dwelling and not be visible within the streetscene. Officers consider this element of the overall development to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rPolicy Guidance 40 (Piggyback Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD 2013  states that where the character of the property and wider streetscene allows  there may be some scope to obtain planning permission to  construct a 'piggyback' extension where:\r- The extension if set back from the front elevation of the house by at least 4m\r- The house is a narrow plot and the side elevations are highly visible from the street scene\r- Materials and detailing are selected to match or complement the original house\r- The extension does not increase the height of the eaves and ridge by more than 1.3m\r- The gaps between the first floor side elevations of neighbouring dwellings are no more than 2.1m to reduce the impact of the extension on the character of the streetscene; and\r-No dormer style roof extensions are proposed in addition to the piggyback extension\r\rOfficers have reviewed the piggy back roof extension within the context of the existing roof arrangements of the dwellinghouse. The majority of dwellinghouses along Durlston Road present large gable ends on the front elevations facing the street.\r\rThe front elevation of this dwellinghouse  presents a projecting gable and bay windows arrangement which is shallow in depth.\r\rBehind this resides the main built form of the dwellinghouse where the roof form arrangement changes. A hip roof arrangement is presented with sloping roofs on all four elevations. In respect of the front elevation hipped roof arrangement the roof slope/plane retreats  away from the road. The existing rear elevation illustrates the same roof slope/plane retreating away from the garden.\r\rThe proposed piggybank roof extension is seeking to be positioned towards the rear of the dwellinghouse yet it will have a significant impact on the physical appearance and structure of both front and rear elevations.\r\rIn terms of the rear elevation of the dwellinghouse, physical structure and appearance will significantly change from a hip roof arrangement  to a flat fronted gable arrangement  with a pitched roof  which will accomodate new windows to serve the loft conversion.  \r\rIn terms of the front elevation of the dwellinghouse, even though the piggyback rear extension would be set back towards the rear of the roof it would still be seen as a more prominent feature in terms of its position when viewed from the street scene.  In addition, the proposed roof extension would  both physically and visually conflict in terms of its relationship with the existing roof forms and would not be particularly hidden behind the front gable.  On this basis, the Officers would consider that the proposal  and its its relationship with the existing roof forms would significantly alter the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: In consideration of the above, this element  proposed development is deemed to be unacceptable in terms of  its scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed single storey outbuilding is to be positioned adjacent to the shared boundary  with no 19 Durlston Road consisting of a wooden fence and vegetation. It would extend beyond the building line of no.19, however it would follow the same building line as the new rear extension at no.23 thereby contained within the same building envelope. On this basis,it is considered to be an acceptable  in terms of built form and scale  without affecting the character and setting of the house and surrounding area nor adversely affecting the amenities of no.19 by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed outbuilding would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
