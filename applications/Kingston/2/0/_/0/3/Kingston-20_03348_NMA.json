The development shall be constructed in accordance with the approved finishes. \r\ris hereby replaced by:\r\rThe development shall be constructed in accordance with the external finishes approved by application 19/02586/COND and Details of External Finishes document dated 29.01.21 and retained as approved. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy Dm10(Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy adopted April 2012.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non material amendment to planning permission ref. no 22/02378/HOU to move the rear building line by 160mm.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the rear elevation and also other changes which they have not described on the application form such as the introduction of side facing glazing to the first floor rear extension. Overall, it is considered that the proposed amendments would be material.",
