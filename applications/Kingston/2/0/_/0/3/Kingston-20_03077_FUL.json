    "Application Site: \r\rThe application relates to an approximately 0.27ha site to the rear of Sunnyfarm located to the south-east of Green Lane. The site comprises a large single-storey building.  The site benefits from an existing vehicular access point to the side of Sunnyfarm. The site is adjoined by residential dwellings to the east and west and a field/garden area to the south-west.\r\rThe site is located within designated Green Belt land. There is a woodland area Tree Protection Order to the west of the site between the site and Bonesgate Stream which is a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). There are no Tree Protection Orders (TPO) on the site. \r\rThe site has a PTAL rating of 0 on a scale of 0-6b with 6b being the most accessible, meaning it has a very low public transport accessibility.  There are bus stops for bus routes 71, 467 and N65, which are located approximately 650m away and 10 minutes walk from the site, along Garrison Lane. Chessington South train station is also within a 10-minute walk from the site. Green Lane is a local unclassified road. The site is not within a controlled parking zone (CPZ). \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is the change of use from an industrial to residential unit with associated works, including the installation of solar panels. \r\rRelevant History: \r\r1219/S: Continued use for light industrial purposes. Granted 09.05.1982. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 4 neighbouring properties were consulted and no representations were received. \r\rConsultees: \r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: no objection, subject to conditions.\r\rTree and Landscape Officer: no objections. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Principle of Development \r- Character and Design \r- Housing Mix\r- Standard of Accommodation \r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Highways and Transportation\r- Biodiversity, Trees and Landscaping\r- Climate Change and Sustainability \r- Fire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development: \r\rThe 2 main components to consider for the principle of development are 1) impacts on the Green Belt; 2) loss of employment floorspace; 3) new residential use. \r\r1) Impacts on Green Belt:\r\rNational Planning Policy Framework 2024 (NPPF) at Paragraph 154 states \"development in the Green Belt is inappropriate.\" Paragraph 152 of the NPPF states that \"inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances.\" \"Very special circumstances' will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm resulting from the proposal, is clearly outweighed by other considerations.\" This is echoed in London Plan 2021 (LP) Policy G2 and LDF Core Strategy 2012 (CS) Policy DM5. \r\rParagraph 154 of the NPPF states there are exceptions to buildings being regarded as inappropriate in the Green Belt. The applicant has argued exemption (h)(iv) is most relevant to the proposal. Exception (h)(iv) states development may be appropriate within the Green Belt if it involves the \"the re-use of buildings provided that the buildings are of permanent and substantial construction\" and the development preserves the openness of the Green Belt and does not conflict with the purposes of including land within it. \r\rRBK's Green Belt and Metropolitan Open Land Assessment 2018 (GBMOLA) identifies the site as falling within GB1 and making a 'significant contribution' to the Green Belt. \r\rThe Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) (Paragraph: 001 Reference ID: 64-001-20190722) states the openness of the Green Belt involves the following aspects: 1) spatial aspects; 2) visual aspects; 3) duration of development; 4) degree of activity, including traffic generation. \r\rIn terms of spatial and visual aspects, the proposal would involve the re-use of the existing building therefore, no new structures or buildings would be introduced on the site. Additional landscaping and 2 car parking spaces and cycle parking would be introduced to support the new residential use. This would be an improvement to the lawful use of the site for vehicle maintenance and repair where multiple vehicles were accessing the site and parked for maintenance. \r\rOfficers consider the proposed development would result in an improvement of the site compared to the existing lawful use and would preserve the openness of the Green Belt in compliance with NPPF Paragraph 154. \r\r2) Loss of employment floorspace: \r\rNPPF at para 85 states planning decisions should help create the conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business needs and wider opportunities for development.\r\rLP Policy E4 states that a sufficient supply of land and premises must be provided and maintained in different parts of London to meet current and future demands for industrial and related functions. \r\rCS Policy DM17 acts to protect existing employment land and premises to meet business needs and provide employment.  The policy is clear that alternative uses will not be acceptable unless it has been demonstrated by sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. \r\rThe Applicant claims the building was formally used for commercial vehicle repairs but this use has long ceased and has been used for domestic storage associated with the adjoining dwelling at Sunnyfarm for several years. Officers confirm the existing lawful use of the building is for light industrial uses (Use Class E) as granted by planning permission in 1982 under 1219/S. \r\rCS Policy DM17 is clear in protecting employment premises. The Applicant claims that there would be no loss of employment as the site does not currently contribute to employment locally. Irrespective of the premises not currently being used for light industrial uses, no supporting information in the form of marketing evidence has been provided to justify the loss of the employment floorspace and demonstrate the site could not be brought back into a commercially viable premises. The site is in a sustainable, albeit remote, location and would be capable of supporting continued employment uses. This is evidenced by the number of operational light industrial uses in the direct vicinity of the site, including car repair workshops Unit 1 and 3 Winry Green Lane. The Kingston Employment Land Review (2022) clearly states there is an acute shortage of small light industrial uses. \r\rThe loss of employment floorspace weighs heavily against the scheme and is contrary to the outcomes sought under LP Policy E4 and CS Policy DM17. \r\r3) New residential development: \r\rLP Policy GG2 and NPPF at Paragraph 125 promote the redevelopment of underutilised land for the delivery of housing. CS Policy CS10 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the LP. LP Policy H1 sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10-year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThe Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply of housing land as required by the NPPF therefore, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In other words, the tilted balance weighs a development's adverse impacts against its benefits, not on a level playing field, but tilted towards granting permission. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application. \r\rThe principle of new residential development on the site is supported as it would contribute towards the borough's housing targets. This carries weight in favour of the application. Support for the principle of development is subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rHousing Mix:\r\rThe NPPF at para 63 directs that the size, type and tenure of housing needed for different groups in the community should be assessed and reflected in planning policies. CS Policy DM13 states new residential development is expected to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types, and provide a minimum of 30% of units as 3 or more bedroom units, unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable.\r\rThe proposal is for a 3-bedroom, 6-person house. The proposal will deliver a family-sized dwelling in compliance with CS Policy DM13. This carries weight in favour of the proposal.\r\rCharacter and Design: \r\rPara 131 of the NPPF states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rCS Policy CS8 and DM10 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed development would retain the existing outbuilding and includes minimal external alterations, including new darkened featured metal cladding, new revised front door position on the south-west elevation and new full height windows on all elevations. Officers consider the cladding and glazing to be contemporary and high-quality. \r\rOfficers confirm the proposal would preserve and enhance the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area. This is given neutral weight in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rStandard of Accommodation: \r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rLP Policy D6 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall GIA, built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. CS Policy DM13 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rThe new house would have a gross internal area of 156sqm in compliance with LP Policy D6. The double bedrooms are all 10.5sqm which is under the required 11.5sqm required floor area under LP Policy D6. The dwelling would provide an acceptable level of storage in compliance with LP Policy D6. The undersized double bedrooms would not achieve a functional and comfortable layout for future occupants. This weighs heavily on the scheme. \r\rThe new house would be dual aspect and each habitable room would be serviced by at least one window for suitable ventilation, outlook and access to natural light in compliance with LP Policy D6. An Internal Daylight and Sunlight Report has been submitted which confirms the internal daylight levels would achieve the target lux levels in line with the BRE Guidelines. \r\rTo protect the privacy of future occupants, condition would be secured to ensure all windows servicing bathrooms would be obscure glazed. \r\rThere would be no change in the ceiling height of the property which achieves a minimum 2.5m floor-to-ceiling height for at least 75% of the GIA, in compliance with LP Policy D6. Officers consider future occupants would be provided with a suitable level of  daylight penetration, ventilation and cooling and a sense of space. \r\rThe new house would have a rear garden with a minimum area of 350sqm, in compliance with CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Residential Design SPD. Officers would have secured details of the proposed boundary treatments by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. \r\rThe new house would be accessible from the south-east side of the building. The proposal would meet at least Building Regulation M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings' in terms of step-free access, in compliance with LP Policy D7.\r\rIn summary, the proposed undersized double bedrooms in the proposed house would not achieve an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants, in terms of functional and comfortable layout, contrary to LP Policy D6 and CS Policy DM10. This carries moderate weight against the scheme. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. CS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rNo changes are proposed to the development footprint or structure therefore, there would be no impacts on neighbouring amenity in terms of overbearing enclosure and overshadowing. \r\rNew full height windows are proposed on all elevations, except the south-west elevation. The proposed windows on the south-east elevation would face the rear garden and would not result in adverse impacts on neighbouring privacy. The building is setback appropriately 1.5m from the north and western site boundaries. Development to the north within the rear garden of the Vernette property is an outbuilding. The existing dwellinghouse at Sunnyfarm is located approximately 21m therefore, overlooking opportunities would be mitigated by the setback. The presence of boundary fencing and thick vegetation would assist in mitigating any privacy impacts.\r\rThere would be no noticeable difference in coming and goings to the property however, Officers consider it would be commensurate with the residential setting of Green Lane. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of impacts on neighbouring residential amenity. \r\rHighways and Transportation: \r\rNPPF para 116 states development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network, following mitigation, would be severe. CS Policy DM10 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe proposal would utilise the existing driveway from Green Lane and include 2 car parking spaces in the rear garden. The number of car parks exceeds the maximum standards under LP Table 10.3 (maximum of 1.5 car parks within an Outer London PTAL 0 location) however, the Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer considers it to be acceptable due to the site conditions and location. The Design and Access Statement confirms the car parking would be supported by EV charging in compliance with LP Policy T6.1(C). If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, details of these facilities would have been secured by condition. \r\rA total of 3 cycle parking spaces are proposed adjacent to the car parking area in compliance with LP Policy T5. Details of the cycle storage would be secured by condition to ensure it is weatherproof, secure and accessible in line with the London Cycle Design Standards. \r\rWaste storage is shown on the Proposed Site Plan as being located to the south of the vehicle accessway. This storage location is approximately 70m from Green Lane which significantly exceeds the required drag distances under Appendix 2 of the Residential Design Guide SPD. The Design and Access Statement states sufficient access and turn-around facilities are proposed on-site for a refuse collection vehicle however, no details have been provided. No details of the proposed waste storage capacity or collection arrangements have been provided. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, these details would be secured by condition to ensure they comply with the required storage capacity standards and siting requirements under the Residential Design Guide SPD and CS Policy CS9. \r\rA Construction Management Plan would have been secured if the scheme was otherwise acceptable to manage impacts of construction vehicles on the local highway and is appropriately managed and there would be no adverse waste or spills that may harm the environment. \r\rOverall, Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has not objected to the proposal. The proposal would not adversely impact the local road network and would provide sufficient cycle and refuse storage facilities, subject to final details being secured by condition. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rBiodiversity, Trees and Landscaping: \r\rNPPF at para 136 states trees make an important contribution to the character and quality of urban environments, and can also help mitigate and adapt to climate change. LP Policy G6 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain (BNG). CS Policy DM6 echoes these principles. \r\rLP Policy G7 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. CS Policy DM10 sets out that the Council expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe proposal would primarily involve internal changes only and will not impact priority habitat or protection/priority species therefore is exempt from securing BNG. \r\rA Bat Emergency Survey Report (dated August 2024) was submitted. The survey was carried out between 24 and 26 June 2024. The report confirms no bats were observed roosting within the building and no further surveys were required. The report recommends bat friendly lighting is installed. The recommendations of the Bat Emergency Survey Report would have been secured by condition if the scheme was otherwise acceptable. \r\rA Tree Constraints Plan, Tree Impact Assessment, Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Method Statement were submitted. No trees would be impacted by the proposed development. The information confirms no trees would be removed, pruning would be required on T7, and 3 trees would be impacted by new hard surfacing. The Council's Tree Officer has raised no objection to the proposed works. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, the recommended tree protection methods would have been secured by condition. \r\rA high level landscaping plan has been proposed. If the scheme was otherwise acceptable, a detailed landscaping plan, including long-term management, would have been secured by condition. \r\rThe proposal is acceptable in terms of ecology, tree impacts and landscaping, subject to securing final details by condition. This is a neutral matter in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rClimate Change and Sustainability: \r\rNPPF at para 161 sets an expectation that planning will support transition to a low carbon future. LP Policy SI 2 requires major development to be net zero-carbon. Although the subject application is not a major application, greenhouse gas emissions should be minimised to the greatest extent possible. CS Policy DM3 states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe proposal would reuse an existing building which is supported from a sustainability perspective. PV panels would be installed on the roof which is in line with green sustainability objectives under LP Policy SI 2 and CS Policy DM3. \r\rIf the proposal was otherwise acceptable, a condition requiring the proposed dwelling to achieve a mains water consumption of 105L or less per person per day would have been secured, in line with the Optional Requirement of the Building Regulations and specified in LP Policy SI 5. \r\rThe proposal is supported on climate change and sustainability grounds. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rA Fire Safety Strategy has been submitted that demonstrates the proposal would provide a suitable means of emergency escape and be fitted with passive and active fire safety measures. The proposed dead-end accessway to the new house is approximately 70m long however, sufficient turning space is provided at the head of the driveway for fire-fighting vehicles in compliance with Requirement B5 of Approved Document B. Officers consider the highest standard of fire safety has been achieved on the site in compliance with LP Policy D12. \r\rIf the scheme was otherwise acceptable, the Fire Safety Strategy would  have been secured by condition. This is given neutral weight in the assessment.\r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. \r\rThe proposed development would result in an improvement of the site compared to the existing lawful light industrial use and would preserve the openness of the Green Belt in compliance with NPPF Paragraph 154. This carries positive weight in favour of the application. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5-year housing supply. The proposed development would provide a new dwellinghouse and would make a small but positive contribution towards the Borough's housing supply. This is afforded weight in favour of the proposal. \r\rNo sound evidence or rigorous marketing has been submitted to justify there is no quantitative or qualitative need for the employment floorspace. The site could continue to operate as a commercially viable premises which is evidenced by the number of successful Class E Uses within direct vicinity of the site. The loss of employment floorspace is contrary to LP Policy E4 and CS Policy DM17 and carries significant weight against the scheme. \r\rThe new dwelling would include undersized double bedrooms resulting in a dysfunctional internal layout and poorly designed home for future occupants, contrary to LP Policy D6 and CS Policy DM10. This weighs heavily against the scheme.\r\rImpacts on residential neighbouring amenity, car parking, cycle and waste storage and collection, ecology, trees and landscaping, climate change and sustainability, and fire safety are neutral matters which could have been appropriately managed by securing final details via conditions. \r\rOfficers have taken into account the Housing Delivery Test tilted presumption in favour of development as set out in para 11 of the NPPF whilst considering the conflicts with the Development Scheme. For this scheme, the adverse impacts of the development would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF taken as a whole. As such, Officers recommend planning permission be refused.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a  ground floor commercial unit and is located in the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area, a designated heritage asset. It is also located adjacent to  2 High Street, locally listed building (non designated heritage asset)  and opposite  Guildhall, Grade 2 listed building  (designated heritage asset) and within close proximity of Clattern Bridge, Grade 2 listed (designated heritage asset). \r\r In addition, the site is also  within  :\r\rArea of Archaeological Significance 1.1 Kingston Core, \rArea of Archaeological Significance 2.2 Kingston Town, \rArticle 4  Kingston\rArticle 4 Kingston town centre\rFlood Zone 2, 3 and 3b\rThames Side Strategic Area of Special Character\rThames Policy Area Riverside Strategy \r\rConsultation \rNeighbour consultation - 14 notified, no response\r\rKTCAAC - objection. This a retrospective application because the delivery window has been in use for several weeks. It is an inappropriate addition to this sensitive location which is adjacent to the Grade 1 listed Clattern bridge and Grade 2 listed Guildhall as well as numerous locally listed assets. It follows PA 24/02633 for signage from the same applicant  which we objected to & has been refused by officers.\r\rHighways - objection. The site has a PTAL of 6a, which indicated  an excellent level of public transport accessibility and a bus stop is located outside the site, which serves bus routes 85, 371, 458, 465, 515, 715, K1, K4, 513/514, respectively. The listed number of bus services going through the above mentioned bus stop provides an indication of the very busy nature of the public footway outside the site building and High Street, in general.\r\rThe proposed alteration of the existing glass panel and its replacement with a glazed open swing window to allow for delivery access, would obstruct the safe use of the public footway by pedestrians and commuters, who are waiting to board the respective bus services at the above mentioned bus stop. As such the proposal is considered unacceptable and goes contrary to Policy T2 - Healthy Streets of the London Plan 2021. \r\r\rPlanning History\rThe application site has been the subject of  numerous  planning applications for alterations to the shopfront and the display of advertisements. The most recent  planning history is set out below.\r\r24/02633/ADV - Installation of 2nos internally illuminated fascia signs and 2nos internally illuminated projecting signs. Refused 19.12.24\r15/013007/ADV - Display of 2 externally illuminated fascia signs and 2 externally illuminated projected signs. Granted 07.12.15\r14/013325/FUL - Alterations to external elevations of nos 2-6 High Street. GRanted 17.08.15\r14/12858/FUL Replacement of 2 x existing shop fronts to form 1 x new shop front. Granted 01.10.14\r14/12520/FUL - Change of use of ground and first floors to A3 (restaurant) use, with associated ventilation ducting. Granted 27.10.14\r882218 - Display of externally illuminated fascia sign. Granted 06.04.89\r882125 - Display of externally illuminated fascia sign. Granted 07.02.89\r\rProposal\rAlteration to shop front  with new delivery collection window, decoration and signage as stated on the validation letter. \r\rIn determining this planning application, Officers have solely assessed and duly  determined the proposed alteration to the shopfront of this ground floor commercial unit .This is on the basis that Officers note that the proposed signage as shown on the submitted drawings  replicates the signage  proposal which was presented  within the recent submission for an application  consent to display advertisement application  24/02633/ADV which was refused on 19.12.24.  The Officer's decision on this matter  (proposed signage) would not be indifferent  to the issued decision for 24/02633/ADV and has therefore  the signage elements been excluded from  the description of proposed works for the determination of this application. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe submitted application drawings identify the proposed works as follows subject to this application :\r - Existing glazing to be replaced with fixed glazed panel and inward opening hinged rider collection window. Framing painted to match shopfront\r - New glazed window panel.\r\rWithin the supportive Planning Design and Access Statement and the separate Heritage Design Access statement , the description of proposed works is as follows :\r\r'The proposed works to the shopfront exterior would  comprise a complete made good and repainting of the existing timber shopfront, stall riser and pilasters.   Made good and repaint existing fascia (and new illuminated signage. New projecting and fascia signs. Menu signage and pendant signage behind the existing glass - RBK not determining these works as part of the application). \r\rAlteration to existing glass panel to the RHS to replace with glazed open swing window to allow for delivery access'. \r\rOfficers note an inconsistency between the submitted drawings and the illustrative drawing of the proposed altered shopfront in the Planning Design and Access Statement and separate Heritage Design Access Statement  with regard to the details of the proposed delivery collection  window in terms of the size and number of glazed panels. \r\rAt the time of writing this Officer Report, it is noted that  works have been carried out  to alter the shopfront of the identified ground floor commercial unit  at 4-6 High Street  in the absence of a planning decision.None of these works correlate with the identified proposed works  as set out in this planning application.   The applicant would  therefore be advised to submit a separate planning application relating to the implemented works for determination  by the Local Planning Authority. \rBased on the submitted plans  under planning application 24/02632/FUL for the alterations to the shopfront, Officers have considered the proposal in the context of RBK Supplementary Planning Guidance (SPG) 'Shopfronts and Shop Sign Design Guide'  2005.   Page 7  Design Approach stipulates that 'A statement should be submitted that makes a logical case in support of the application'.  The SPG  Design Approach continues by stating  'Any alterations or new shopfronts should be considered in the context of the wider streetscene. Elements should relate to one another in terms of scale and location. The relationship between individual properties can contribute to an overall character, which creates an environment attractive to shoppers.'\r\rSection 3 of the SPG sets out the General Shopfront Principles that states that '(v) the scale and proportion and profile of window frames, glazing bars and door locations should be derived from the characteristics of the street and the architectural style of the upper floors.'  Under  Section 3.1  Specific shopfront principles B Window frame and door principles  (27), the SPG stipulates  that 'Glazing should always be transparent, even in non retail units. Opaque, frosted, reflective, mirrored or tinted glass is normally unacceptable, unless it has a functional use in small selective areas.  Shatterproof safety glass (laminated glass) should be used to ensure public safety  and as a security measure'.\r\rShould Officers be minded to approve  this planning application,  planning conditions  would be   attached to the  planning decision requiring  the inward opening hinged rider collection window as shown on the submitted drawings to be inward opening only and the new glazed window panel  to the far right of the shopfront would be transparent  glazed.\r\rIn the context of the  existing shopfront,  whilst the proposed alterations would alter the proportionality and appearance of the far right hand side of the shopfront in terms of the glazed panel arrangement , it is considered  that the proposal is unlikely to have a detrimental harmful impact on the  overall character and appearance of the shopfront and  would preserve the overall character and appearance of the surrounding area which forms part of the  Old Kingston Town Conservation Area. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets  \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 202 to 221 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 207 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe building occupies a prominent position in the street scene, adjacent to a locally listed building (2 High Street)  and opposite Guildhall, Grade 2 listed building  (designated heritage asset) and within close proximity of Clattern Bridge, Grade 1 listed (designated heritage asset).  It also resides within Kingston Old Town Conservation Area (designated heritage asset).\r\rIn light of the above  character and design assessment,  overall, it is considered that the proposed change would have a negligible impact on the character and appearance of the host building. The harm identified would not be considered to be less than substantial harm  and the proposal deemed acceptable.  Within the context of the existing building, it is considered that the proposed alteration to the shopfront would not result in less than substantial  harm to the significance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation  Area.\r\rImpact on Highways\rThe proposed alterations to the shopfront includes the replacement of the existing glazing with a fixed glazed panel and inward opening hinged rider collection window .   An objection has been received from RBK Highways  raising concern  that the installation of the delivery collection window and its operation would  obstruct the safe use of the public footway by pedestrians and commuters within its vicinity. Officers note the  width of the existing public footway within the close vicinity of the proposed  delivery collection window is  unduly narrow. The applicant has not  submitted  any acceptable  mitigation details  for Officers to review  in terms of how the delivery collections would operate both in terms of drivers waiting for collections on the public footway and the parking of vehicles particularly at peak times  in order to not obstruct the safe use of the public footway.\r\rRBK Highways conclude that the proposal for alterations to the shop front would be unacceptable and would be contrary to Policy T2 - Healthy Streets of the London Plan 2021. RBK Officers  endorse this conclusion.  \r\rConclusion \rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. \r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "In establishing eaves height, the Permitted development rights for householders Technical Guidance ( September 2019) advises that 'The height of the eaves will be measured from the ground level at the base of the external wall of the extension to the point where the external wall would meet ( if projected upwards) the upper surface of the roof slope.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \rOne response received in objection. \r- Concern regards use\r- Boundary incursion\r- Traffic problems\r\rOfficer comment: \rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle of the development\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rPrinciple of the development\rThe application seeks planning permission to erect an outbuilding to the rear of an existing dwelling house within its curtilage. It is proposed that the outbuilding would be used for purposes incidental or ancillary to the primary use of the main dwelling house. \r\rOfficers are concerned that the size and layout of the proposed outbuilding have the appearance of a self contained unit and there are all the primary functions of a self contained dwelling present kitchen, living room, separate bedroom and bathroom. In addition to this the outbuilding would have an independent access via the rear access road and gate. The size of the rear garden and the layout of the site is such that given the access to the rearthe plot could easily be subdivided. \r \rOfficers have considered whether the use of a condition would restrict the possibility of the outbuilding being used independent of the main dwelling and conclude a condition would not be fit for purpose in this instance given the above points. \r\rOn balance it is considered that the proposal would tip the scales of what is considered to be incidental/ancillary to the primary use of the site a single dwelling house and that the proposal would not be ancillary or incidental to the primary use of the site a dwellinghouse. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r",

    "The new proposaApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of garage to habitable room with changed to fenestrations. Erection of single storey rear and first floor side extensions, erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion and all associated works\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the current flat roofed element of the existing property that appears to have been permitted circa 1979. The proposed hipped roof extension to accommodate the proposed rear dormer is of a poor design and would be discordant when viewed within the streetscene. This, combined with the existing flat roofed area would be jarring and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area  The proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 4 (Details of Extraction System) of planning permission 24/00732/FUL, which states:\r\rPrior to the installation of the proposed extraction system, full details of the proposed extraction system shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The submission shall include, where applicable, details of:\r\r(i) The extract fan, attenuators (it is recommended that the infill is protected by Melinex polyester film), anti-vibration mounts, high velocity cowl, filters, odour abatement and any other items of plant;\r\r(ii) The velocity of the air at final discharge and duct termination height and location\r\r(iii) The retention time of gases in the carbon filters (where applicable);\r\r(iv) A maintenance schedule;\r\r(v) A completion of an risk assessment of odour and demonstration of compliance with \"Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems\" published by EMAQ+ dated September 2018, which replaced the previous Defra guidance, now withdrawn.\r\rThe approved extraction system shall be installed on site in accordance with the approved details and shall be retained and maintained thereafter. Any variations thereafter shall be agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rNotwithstanding the information on the approved drawings a which permits undisturbed vertical flow of the exhaust gases must be used in the final design and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey side extension with associated landscaping. Replacement of existing rear patio door.\r\rConsultations\r14 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 4.2m, the proposed front elevation would be made of brick similar to the existing one, it would have a solder brick course and reconstituted stone lintel/canopy. As such the proposal would appear in keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area when viewed from Chatnam Road, there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene as a result of the proposal.\r\rThe proposed extension would  gradually increase its height to approximately 4m and width towards the rear. It is acknowledged that the proposed total height of the extension featuring a flat roof would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 35, however considering the proposed design, scale and siting it is considered to be acceptable in this case.\r\rThe elements of the flat roof would not be directly visible with Chatnam Road. The proposed timber cladding and aluminium framed glazing system would appear as a modern extension to a traditional dwelling. \r\rThe proposed mass and bulk of the proposal due to its siting, is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Officers note the existing two storey side extension at the adjoining property No 56 Chatham Road, planning permission ref no 92/0046/FUL. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings at the adjoining property No 56. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
