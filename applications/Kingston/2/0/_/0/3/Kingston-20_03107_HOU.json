    "The proposed dormer extension, by reason of its size and positioning in the roofslope, would appear as a top-heavy addition to the property that would unduly dominate the roofslope and would have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area, due to the property's visually prominent location. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design",
    "Officers note that the applicant does not have listed building consent for the works approved under 23/02606/FUL. The Building the proposal relates to is a statutorily listed building. This permission does not act as Listed Building Consent and you are accordingly advised of the need to submit a separate Listed Building Consent application in respect of the works shown on the drawings approved under planning permission 23/02606/FUL and the subsequent details of condition 3 approved by this decision.",
    "Please provide Proposed Floor Plans as mention in the checklist at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North."
