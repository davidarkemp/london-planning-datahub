    "The excessive height, bulk and mass of the single storey rear extension and roof terrace, the use of brick for such a large expanse of the rear elevation, the flat roof form, the design and position of the windows in the rear elevation and the sprial staircase would would combine to form an incogruous addition that would not relate well to the host property or the prevailing form and pattern of development in the area, thereby resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Due to the excessive and incongruous nature of the single storey rear extension and its terrace and the removal of the chimney the proposed development would harm the property's original Victorian architecture, form and proportions and the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm that would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking into the habitable rooms of No. 2 Geneva Road, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2023.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \rNo response received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed development would not follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted Residential Design SPD. However in this instance in the context of the site and its surroundings the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is acknowledged that the proposed development would not follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted Residential Design SPD. However in this instance in the context of the site and its surroundings it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\rThe application is supported by a fire safety strategy. The statement is considerd adequate for the purposes of showing the proposed development would comply with policy D12 of the London Plan. A condition is recommended to secure that the development would be carried out and thereafter maintained as such in accrodance with the deposited fire safety strategy. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "The application seeks approval of the details required by Condition 5 (Fire safety) of planning permission 23/01262/HOU.\r\rThe wording of Condition 5 (Fire safety) of planning permission 23/01262/HOU.\r\rPrior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022),  where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) shall be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rThe applicant has deposited a reasonable exception statement prepared by All about Lofts.\r\rThe details have been reviewed  and officers are satisfied that in the context of the proposed development and the site the details meet the requirements for condition 5 of planning permission 23/01262/HOU.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling and does not fall within an area with constraints.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to the following:\r\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r - Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Fumes\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r\rOfficers acknowledge the objections regarding noise, however, officers would not expect noise levels from a development of this scale to be unacceptable to neighbouring properties. Additionally, concerns raised regarding the fumes are not considered material planning considerations and, therefore will not be included in the assessment of this application. All other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 23/00524/FUL - Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Drawings) for Application Reference Number: 22/00186/HOU (Demotiltion of existing rear conservatory, erection of front porch, part two storey part single storey infill to side and rear extension with juliet balcony in first floor. Erection of roof extension with 1no rear and 2nos side dormers, installation of 3 nos front, 2 nos side  roof light to facilitate loft conversion. Formation of dropped kerb) amendments to single storey rear extension to facilitate a better internal layout and alterations to fenestration at ground floor flank and introduction of a juliet baclony at second floor. Approved 24.04.2023\r\r- 22/00186/HOU - Demotiltion of existing rear conservatory, erection of front porch, part two storey part single storey infill to side and rear extension with juliet balcony in first floor. Erection of roof extension with 1no rear and 2nos side dormers, installation of 3 nos front, 2 nos side  roof light to facilitate loft conversion. Formation of dropped kerb. Approved 22.06.2022\r\rProposal Description \rDemolition of an existing house and erection of a new dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The standard of accommodation provided\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways.\r- Climate Change and Sustainability\r- Fire Safety.\r\rAccommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires developments to provide adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have a minimum of 50sqm of private garden (plus an extra 5sqm for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal seeks to demolish the existing dwelling on the corner of Lawrence Avenue and Landseer Road to provide a 5-bedroom property. Policy D6 Housing quality and standards of the London Plan (2021) require 3-storey new build dwellings to have a minimum gross internal floor area (GIA) of 134sqm, the new dwelling would have a gross internal floor area of approximately 278sqm, exceeding the minimum requirement of Table 3.1, Policy D6 of the London Plan. Concerning outdoor space, the applicant proposes to retain approximately 167sqm of garden amenity space which falls in line with Policy Guidance 13 (Private Amenity Space), of the Residential Design SPD.\r \rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed new dwelling has been deemed acceptable by previous planning permissions (ref: 22/00186/HOU).\r\rThe applicant proposes to demolish the existing dwelling and erect a new dwelling with the same width as the existing dwelling of approximately 10.1m. The existing dwelling has a depth of approximately 13m, including the single-storey rear extension and the bay window to the front of the property. The applicant proposes that the new dwelling would extend a further 2.1m towards the rear bringing the total depth of the dwelling to 15.1m.\r\rThe proposed development would not significantly change the fenestration of the front elevation, however, the proposal would include a change to the door, an increased ridge and 3 new roof lights. The proposed raised roof may appear slightly odd in this vicinity as neighbouring properties have uniform heights, however, the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed pitched roof form would still respect what is seen in the immediate vicinity of Lawrence Avenue and there would not be any significant harm to character and appearance as a result of the raised ridge. Officers would not raise concerns regarding the new roof lights and door.\r\rThe rear elevation would have a staggered two-storey and finish with a single-storey rear extension. The existing conservatory sits at a slight distance from the shared boundary with No.28 (approximately 600mm) and the proposed single-storey rear extension would maintain a distance from the shared boundary of approximately 400mm. \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an acceptable impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not demonstrated on plan or elevation the effects the proposed development would have on neighbouring property No.28 Lawrence Avenue. Therefore, officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25-Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe proposed scheme would only offer an improvement on the living conditions of the occupiers as the depth of the extension would be reduced by 2m from approved planning application ref: 22/00186/HOU.  No adverse impacts are expected from the increased glazing to the ground floor north-west facing elevation or the juliet balcony at seconfd floor level. In conclusion, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rHighways\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013  seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that a concern has been raised regarding car parking and access or traffic problems, however, the applicant has submitted an application form that states that the parking provision would increase to two car parking spaces, therefore, the proposed development would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site.\r\rIn terms of cycle parking, it is considered that given the size of the rear garden and the retention of the side access, secure and covered cycle storage could be accommodated in the rear garden and easily accessed.\r\rOverall, the proposal would not have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10 standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rClimate Change and Sustainability\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes level 6. Policy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would have to comply with Part L of the current Building Regulations. In relation to water, details demonstrating internal water consumption of no greater than 105l per person per day would be secured by planning condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Plan which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
