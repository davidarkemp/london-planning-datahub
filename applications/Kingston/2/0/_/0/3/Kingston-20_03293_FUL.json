    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling situated on the south side of Gloster Road. There are no Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on-site or in the immediate vicinity of the proposals and the site is not subject to any heritage constraints.\r\rProposal\r\rDemolition of garage and conservatory and erection of single storey side extension\r\rConsultation\r\r20 neighbours were notified of the proposals. In response, 1 neutral representation was received stating that the grass verge should be reinstated outside the property.\r\rOfficer Note: The grass verge does not fall within the application site boundary. The commenter is advised that defects with grass verges and the public highway can be reported via the Council's website.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would not be set-back from the front elevation of the property as is recommended in the Residential Design SPD, however, it is noted that it would replace an existing garage which also lacks any set-back (this is similar to an extension at neighbouring No. 2 also). Within this site specific context, it is considered that the proposal would not appear incongruous or cause any unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the street scene. The single storey rear element of the proposals would also be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal would not have any adverse impact on the amenities of adjoining No. 3. With reference to No. 5, the relatively limited projection of the extension beyond the rear elevation of No. 5 would ensure that there would not be any significant adverse impact in terms of loss of daylight, sunlight or overbearing impact. Overall, it is considered that the proposals would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbours.\r\rHighway and Car Parking\r\rThe existing garage car parking space would be lost as part of the proposals, however, it would appear that sufficient space would be retained in the front garden for the parking of a vehicle. It is further noted that, in any case, the existing garage does not meet the current size requirements for garages and may not be able to accommodate modern cars. Overall, and on balance, it is considered unlikely that there would be any adverse highway impact or overspill car parking beyond the existing situation.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a draft Fire Safety Strategy which suggests that the proposals could meet the requirements of Policy D12(A). It is considered that a robust and final Fire Safety Strategy could be secured by planning condition.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to accord with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

The proposed rear dormer would incorporate 3 x gabled dormers that would appear similar to the ones approved under planning permission ref 23/00835/HOU. The proposed set down distance from the existing roof would be slightly increased to approximately 40cm when compared to 23/00835/HOU. The proposed set in distances from the roof eaves would exceed the recommended 50cm (as per Policy Guidance 39). As such, given the proposed design, scale and siting the proposed rear dormer is considered to be acceptable.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy Report, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

Erection of two storey side extension, part single part two storey rear extension, and erection of a single storey front extension.'\r\rIt is acknowledged that various style roof extensions are present with Mayfair Avenue. Therefore, the proposed roof infill to the side, although not ideally as it would disturb the symmetry of the main roof, would be in keeping with the existing street scene. \r\rWith regards to the proposed rear dormer roof extensions, it would be in conflict with Policy Guidance 39 due to its excessive scale and lack of adequate set in distances from the roof eaves. Policy Guidance 39 recommends a minimum of 50cm set down distance from the ridge of the existing roof and 50cm set in distances from the roof eaves. Furthermore, it would interfere with the existing roof over the first floor extension and adversely affect its design and symmetry. \r\rThe total enlargement of the roof would likely exceed 50 cubic metres and would not constitute permitted development, therefore this cannot be used as a 'fallback' position in this case.\r\rOfficers note the submitted photographs of the surrounding  area showing various roof extensions, however this document failed to demonstrate a similar scale and design roof extensions that would benefit from planning permission.\r\rAs such, the proposed rear dormer roof extension due to its excessive scale, siting and the proposed design would not be in keeping with the existing roof extensions, host dwelling and the surrounding area. It would appear as a disproportionate and dominant addition that would have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwelling and the surrounding area.  \rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "--- Officer Report ---\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development.1 letter of objection received and states : \r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Privacy \r\rThese material considerations will be included within the assessment. Concerns have been raised about the impact of the proposal  on the value of the property; however this is  not a material planning consideration.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear and single storey side and front porch extension. Erection of outbuilding to rear. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r21/03277/HOU - Conversion of garage to a habitable room and erection of a front porch. Refused 20.4.22\r98/5111/FUL - Erection of single storey rear extension and 1st floor side extension. Granted 15.02.99\r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval  for the erection of a single story rear and single storey side and front porch extension. Erection of an outbuilding to the rear. demolish an existing garage and the erection of a single storey side extension to match the size of existing. \r\rOfficers note the proposed single rear extension would be compliant with Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD and therefore is  deemed acceptable. \r\rWith regard to the proposed single storey side extension, Officers note the existing garage abuts the shared boundary with neighbouring no1 Reynolds Road and has a rear access   providing direct access  to the rear garden. To enlarge the existing WC, the proposal seeks to extend the existing western elevation wall to adjoin the shared boundary wall with neighbouring no1 Reynolds Road.  In addition, Officers note the  proposed front extension of the dwelling  which would result in the creation of a front porch extension as well as additional floorspace for the proposed bedroom.  Overall, the  proposed front extension  would be marginally set back from the existing front building line of neighbouring no1 Reynolds Road. Whilst it is noted that  the  proposed front porch extension would not be compliant with Policy Guidance 38  in terms of not being at least 500mm from an existing bay window, Officers note a similar arrangement is presented at no 2 Reynolds Road.\r\rThe application proposal also includes the erection of a single storey outbuilding within the rear garden to be used as a gym.  It should be noted by the applicant that the proposed outbuilding  would  duly fall within the parameters of permitted development rights.  Should Officers be minded to approve the application, an appropriate planning condition would be attached to the planning permission stipulating that the proposed outbuilding would only be used  for a purpose ancillary or incidental, or both, to the residential use  of the dwellinghouse  at  3 Reynolds Road as set out in writing on the submitted application form.  \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side, rear and front  porch extension together with the outbuilding, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at no 1 Reynolds Road.\r\rWhilst the properties along Reynolds Road are detached, many of the properties have garages which adjoin the dwelling and  consequently provide resultant  a built form physical connection  between dwellings.  This is a common feature in residential suburban areas.  \r\rA shared boundary exists between nos 1 and 3 Reynolds Road consisting of a close boarded wooden fence of approximately 1.8m  which runs the length of the garden. Officers note the proposed separation distance between the proposed rear extension and the shared boundary  is respectfully consistent with the existing arrangement. In addition, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension is sufficiently set back from the boundary and together with low eaves does not raise a concern   in terms of  presenting an overbearing appearance  and the creation of a sense of enclosure.  The presence of rooflights  is a common acceptable feature of  rear extension. \r\rIn considering the impact on daylight at no1 Reynolds Road by the proposed single storey rear extension, the proposals would pass the BRE 45 degree  rule in relation to the closest habitable room window. It is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour. \r\rConcern has also been raised with regards to the level of sunlight getting to the neighbouring property during the day.Officers  have considered the proposal in the context of BRE guidelines (2022) and note that the existing two storey dwelling already cast shadow  within the garden of neighbouring no1 Reynolds Road. It is considered that the addition of a single storey rear extension with low eaves height and shallow roof design would not significantly contribute to the existing situation  In addition, the size of the existing garden is noted  and  in the context of the guidelines  Officers considered that the existing garden  would be adequately sunlit throughout the year, and at least half of a garden or amenity area should receive at least two hours of sunlight on 21 March.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves  the conversion of the existing garage/ storage space. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space (s) as evidenced in the submitted photographs, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, and a condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

Refused 31.07.24\r\rPlanning Assessment  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey infill to side/ rear extension.  \r\rOfficers note the applicant has revisited the proposal following the refusal of earlier applications ( ref :24/01269/HOU and 24/02532/HOU).\r\rThe proposal seeks to retain the existing single storey rear extension which has a single aspect roof. \r\rThe proposed single storey side and rear infill would extend a maximum depth of 5.395m  from the existing rear elevation wall of the dwelling and a width of 2.265m.  Neighbouring no 259  Malden Road has a single storey 3m depth rear extension with a single aspect roof (planning ref : 97/05025/FUL). It would infill the existing external space between no 2 Amberwood Rise and neighbouring 259 Malden Road, extending 2.4m beyond the existing rear building line of the neighbouring  single storey rear extension.  The proposed infill extension would have a single aspect roof with an eaves height of 3m and a maximum pitch height of  3.8m accommodating 3nos rooflights . Whilst the proposed  depth of the overall infill rear/ side extension exceeds the Policy Guidance 33  recommendation in the Residential Design SPD, Officers note the  design revisions  with the reduction of the overall depth of the built form along the shared  boundary with neighbouring 259 Malden Road and would be considered to be acceptable.  \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at no 259 Malden Road. \r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r",
