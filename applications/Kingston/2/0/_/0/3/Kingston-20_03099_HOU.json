    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension and changes to fenestration\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Loss of light/Sunlight \r- Noise\r- Privacy\rOfficer response: The above concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension of approximately 2.7m to the existing rear extension would result in the total depth of the rear projection of approximately 6.7m. The proposed eaves height of the new addition would be approximately 3.4m. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depths (up to 4 m for detached properties) and height (up to 3.3m parapet roof). However, considering the siting of the proposal and separation distances, it is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed alterations to fenestration are considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe proposal would not be highly visible within the street view, as such the proposal would not have a significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe main dwellings to consider when assessing the impacts on neighbouring amenity are No 3 Culsac Road and the adjoining ground floor maisonette No 14 Thornhill Avenue. \r\rIt is noted that No 3 Culsac Road benefits from the single storey rear extension. Due to the siting of the proposal and the separation distance, it is considered that the proposed extension would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rWith regards to the adjoining block of maisonettes, due to the proposed depth and height of the extension and its siting in relation to the primary/only habitable room window serving what would appear to be a bedroom at No 14 Thornhill Avenue, it is considered that the proposal would result in an overbearing appearance, increased sense of enclosure and reduced level of outlook in relation to this opening that serves the bedroom. \r\rIt is noted that no information has been submitted to indicate how the proposal would meet the 25 degree BRE test in relation to this primary habitable opening at No 14, however considering that the proposed extension would extend approximately 1.3m in front of the rear elevation of No 14, it is likely that it would pass the 25 degree test. \r\rOverall, the proposed rear extension by reason of its siting and bulk, scale and mass would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property No 14 by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of outlook and the creation of an undue sense of enclosure. As such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which is considered to be acceptable. \rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved statement and thereafter maintained.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The application site is located on the grass verge opposite 82 Coombe Lane West and immediately west of the junction of West Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character. The immediate surrounding buildings and curtilage/land are not statutorily or locally listed. The site is located in Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non designated asset).\r\r29 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposed telecoms apparatus.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of 20m street works pole, supporting 6 no antennas, 2 no dishes and the addition of 2 no cabinets. \r \rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the current Development Plan policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2023 states in paragraph 117 states  Applications for electronic communications development (including applications for prior approval under the General Permitted Development Order) should be supported by the necessary evidence to justify the proposed development. This should include:\r\ra) the outcome of consultations with organisations with an interest in the proposed development, in particular with the relevant body where a mast is to be installed near a school or college, or within a statutory safeguarding zone surrounding an aerodrome, technical site or military explosives storage area; and\r\rb) for an addition to an existing mast or base station, a statement that self-certifies that the cumulative exposure, when operational, will not exceed International Commission guidelines on non-ionising radiation protection; or\r\rc) for a new mast or base station, evidence that the applicant has explored the possibility of erecting antennas on an existing building, mast or other structure\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2023 is clear at paragraph 118 in that the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location on the grass verge opposite 82 Coombe Lane West and immediately west of the junction of West Road and opposite and adjacent to a number of residential properties.\r\rThe height of the mast would be 20m which would be in excess of 10 to 12m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed telecoms equipment would be sited within the non designated heritage asset of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would provide the benefit of an improved telecoms offer in the area this benefit does not outweigh the disbenefit of the harm caused by the proposal in its failure to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance of the telecoms apparatus would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with the NPPF 2023 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rHaving reviewed the applicants sequential approach to site selection, officers are not satisfied that alternative sites have been thoroughly assessed with the reasons for discounting other sites seemingly lacking detail or fully reasoned and the site search being limited in its reach. Officers are not satisfied that the application site represents the least harmful option available in the area to meet the additional coverage and capacity requirements and as such would not accord with paragraph 117 of the NPPF.\r\rIt is noted that the proposed telecoms equipment would be sited in close proximity to a young street tree. Officers are concerned that the proposed telecoms apparatus would put future pressure on this young street tree as it matures and may lead to harm to it. The street tree would provide amenity value in the way of providing visual enhancement to the verdant landscape of this part of Coombe Lane West and the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposal would not cause future harm to the street tree and, as such, the proposal would conflict with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits.",
