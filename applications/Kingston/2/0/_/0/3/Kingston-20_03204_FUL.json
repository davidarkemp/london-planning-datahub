    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",

Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r",

    "Officer comments: A BREEAM Report has been submitted which shows an improvement in the BREEAM score from the appplication stage from 73% to 77% ('Excellent' rating). This does not achieve BREEAM 'Outstanding' but details have been provided as to why individual credits cannot be achieved. This reasoning largely relates to the constraints of the site (being a land locked site with no opportunities for new routes through the site for e.g.), the nature of the scheme (being an industrial development which is typically of functional steel frame and cladding construction and with more robust materials being required for an industrial use), being a shell and core development with the end user / fit out not known and as some credits cannot be targeted retrospectively. Some credits also cannot be achieved and are out of the applicant's control, for example, contamination remediation is not required and certain SuDS have been reasonably discounted (as confirmed by the Council's LLFA). Some potential further credits have been targeted to achieve a potential 83% score (still falling short of 'Outstanding') and the condition requires a final BREEAM certificate to confirm whether these are being achieved. \r\rThe applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultants and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 35 (BREEAM) of planning permission 21/03204/FUL, which states:\r\r1. Within 6 months of commencement of the development, a BREEAM 'Outstanding' feasibility report shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority setting out what reasonable efforts have been made to achieve BREEAM Outstanding.\r\r2. No later than 6 months after occupation of the development, a Post Construction Certificate verifying that at least 'Excellent' BREEAM (or 'Outstanding as may be the case depending on part (1) above) level has been achieved unless otherwise agreed in writing beforehand, shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure the implementation of sustainable design, low carbon development and renewable energy\r",
    "It is also noted that the proposed roof plan shows what appears to be a glass roof verandah-type structure but it has not been described on the submitted application form or description of the development. This has therefore not been considered as part of this application",

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to changes to conditions 4 and 5 planning permission 21/03821/KPSID.\r\rCondition 4 - The proposed change seeks to split the condition between works to the MUGA and other remaining works. It remains that the relevant details would be submitted prior to the commencement of the relevant works and so the intent of the condition remains.\r\rCondition 5 - The proposed change seeks to split the condition between works to the MUGA and other remaining works. It remains that the relevant details would be submitted prior to the commencement of the relevant works and so the intent of the condition remains.\r\rIt is considered the changes proposed are non material.",
    "Consultations\r14no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Two representations received, both objecting to the proposals and raising the following concerns:\r-\tObjection to the principle of a new house; concreting over garden land;\r-\tLoss of light;\r-\tExternal lighting would need to comply with standards;\r-\tEnvironmental health considerations must be adhered to.\r\rOfficer comments: Duly noted. These matters are considered fully in the body of this report. In the event of an approval, a condition would be attached in relation to external lighting and an informative would be applied in relation to noise/dust, etc. \r\rRBK Highways and Transportation Team\rObjection based on car parking spaces above London Plan standards.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the erection of two storey side extension to create a new dwelling, erection of a single storey rear extension to the existing dwelling.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- Principle of Development;\r- Standard of Accommodation;\r- Character and Appearance of the Area;\r- Amenities of Neighbouring Occupiers;\r- Transportation;\r- Refuse and Recycling;\r- Sustainability; and \r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\rThe proposal would create 1no. net additional housing unit. The principle of creating a new residential unit within the application area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2023 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe plans submitted as part of this application show a 2-bedroom dwellinghouse, laid out over two floors, as a 4-person dwelling.\r\rFor properties of this size, Policy D6 of the London Plan would require a minimum internal floorspace of 79sqm. \r\rThe proposed new dwelling would provide approx. 97sqm, which would exceed minimum floorspace standards for a 2-bedroom, 4-person dwelling.\r\rThe proposed new dwelling would be provided with built-in storage in excess of requirements.\r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\r\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rThe proposed bedroom No. 2 would not comply with minimum standards to be regarded as a double bedroom, with officers measuring this room as approximately 10.5sqm.\r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated via submitted sections that the proposed accommodation would achieve floor to ceiling heights of 2.5m. \r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be triple aspect with windows provided to the front, side and rear elevations. Officers consider that the proposed dwelling would be afforded sufficient natural light, good outlook and ventilation for the size of dwelling, commensurate with other dwellings along Mount Road.\r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the Borough's Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows).  \r\rThe proposed dwelling would benefit from approximately 90sqm of private outdoor amenity space to the rear. The rear garden would be accessed via patio doors from the open plan kitchen/dining room. This garden area would meet the minimum quantum standards and would also be of a configuration so as to be a good quality, usable space for future occupiers. \r\rThe adjoining dwelling would retain a good-sized garden of approximately 70sqm.\r\rFire Safety\rA Fire Safety Strategy has been submitted. Officers are not satisfied that the Strategy submitted adequately addresses all of the criteria as per Policy D12a of the London Plan 2021. However, officers acknowledge that this could be dealt with via condition requiring the applicant to submit a more detailed fire strategy fully covering all of the criteria set out in Policy D12a of the London Plan.\r\rOverall\rThe layout of the accommodation is considered to represent logical internal floor space with good light, outlook and ventilation and storage space. However, from the information submitted officers cannot be certain that the proposed accommodation would comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan in terms of floor to ceiling heights.  The outdoor amenity space, which exceeds local minimum size standards for new dwellings is welcomed. The proposed dwelling would meet the requirements of the nationally described space standards in terms of internal living accommodation overall, however Bedroom 2 of the proposed new dwellinghouse would fall short of the floor area requirements for a double bedroom. The fire strategy does not address the criteria of Policy D12a of the London Plan.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe proposed new dwelling is considered to be broadly acceptable in character and appearance terms with the general design read as a side extension to the original dwelling, with matching proportions and materiality. \r\rPolicy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013) is most applicable to the proposal.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33 states, rear extensions for semi-detached properties should generally not exceed 3.5 m in depth; if the neighbouring property has a different rear building line then the depth of the extension could be increased; in all cases 50% of the rear garden should remain and a pitched roof should not exceed 4.0m in height (flat roofs should not exceed 3.0m in height and a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height). Overall, extensions should be designed so they appear proportionate and subordinate to the original property. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be in general conformity with PG33. Therefore, the proposal would appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition within the plot and in relation to the main dwelling. Furthermore, the proposed detailing would be of a residential design which would adequately integrate into the character of the main dwelling.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2023 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1.\r\rThe application site benefits from a gap in built form to the east occupying as it does a corner plot and, as such, it is considered that the proposed dwelling would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rA CEMP condition would be imposed in the event of an approval to ensure that the development could be delivered in a way that would minimise disruption to neighbours and safeguard their amenity. \r\rGiven that no amenity concerns have been raised, this matter would hold neutral weight in the overall weighting exercise.\r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2023 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 2, which represents a poor level of accessibility by means of public transport. On-street parking is not restricted within Mount Road. For a property of the size proposed and the existing property in this particular location, Table 10.3 of Policy 6.1 of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum requirement of 1 space per dwelling.\r\rThe proposal would provide for 2no. car parking spaces per dwelling (i.e. 4no. in total) to the rear of No. 93 Mount Road. The level of car parking provision would be above maximum car parking standards set out in Table 6.1 of the London Plan, 2021 and, as such, would not be supported. \r\rAs such, the proposals are considered unacceptable in terms of parking. This is assigned moderate weighting against the scheme.\r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards. Development proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for minimum of 2no. spaces. \r\rWhilst the Design and Access Statement makes mention of cycle storage to the rear garden areas, cycle storage is not shown on the plans for either the existing building or the newly proposed dwellinghouse. Officers consider this could be dealt with via a condition to any grant of planning permission. \r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rWhilst the Design and Access Statement makes mention that \"bins could potentially be sited to the rear garden areas\". However, details of the refuse/recycling storage collection have not been shown on the plans submitted as part of this application for the newly proposed dwelling, or for the existing dwelling. The lack of refuse/recycling provision is assigned moderate weighting against the scheme.\r \rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2023 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy SI2 of the London Plan 2021 requires all new major developments to be zero carbon. However, it does not set any requirements for minor developments.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency via an appropriately worded condition in the event of an approval.\r\rBiodiversity\rPolicy G6 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process. Policy DM6 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echoes these principles.\r\rThis application presents an opportunity to secure biodiversity enhancements, and as such a condition requiring enhancements would be secured.\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at Â£60 per square metre. \r\rThe development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 4, for which the charge is Â£50 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5-year housing supply. \r\rThe proposed development would provide 1no. net additional dwellinghouse. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rIn terms of the quality of the proposed standard of accommodation, the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed accommodation would achieve floor to ceiling heights of 2.5m, and the proposed double bedroom (Bedroom No. 2) would be undersized against minimum floor area standards to be regarded as a double bedroom in planning terms. \r\rThese matters relating to standard of accommodation are given significant weighting against the proposals.\r\rIn terms of impact upon character and appearance and neighbouring amenity, the proposals are not considered to result in any harm. These matters are afforded neutral weighting. \r\rRefuse/recycling has not been indicated on the plans and so officers are unable to determine the suitability of waste provision arrangements to the existing and proposed dwelling. This is given moderate weighting against the proposals.\r\rThe quantum of off-street car parking is in excess of maximum car parking standards contrary to London Plan Table 6.2. This is afforded significant weighting against the proposals.\r\rThe proposals have been assessed as acceptable in terms of fire safety, sustainability, biodiversity and cycling provision, subject to the imposition of conditions requiring further details. These matters are given neutral weighting in the planning balancing exercise. \r\rThe proposed development is found to be in conflict with the development plan. It is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.",
