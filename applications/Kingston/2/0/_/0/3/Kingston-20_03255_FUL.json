    "The proposed development would result in the loss of employment premises in a key employment location. No evidence has been put forward to demonstrate that there is no qualitative or quantative need for the premises for a range of employment uses. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DM17 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide cycle parking for occupants and, in doing so, would fail to promote sustainable transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to enter into a legal agreement that would preclude future occupants of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits. In the absence of such an agreement, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate overspill parking on surrounding streets that would, in turn, compromise highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received concerning Access or traffic problems. Officers acknowledge the concern raised however, issues regarding construction and access are considered civil matters and, therefore, would not be considered as part of this assessment.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would be set in from the boundary line shared with neighbouring properties surrounding No.11 Beresford Road, would be small in scale, would not be visible within the streetscene and would not be incongruous with the wider area, as neighbouring properties benefit from similar outbuildings.\r\rThe applicant has informed that the outbuilding would be used for a purpose that is ancillary/incidental to the existing dwelling. In any case, a planning condition would secure this in the event of approval.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which suitably addresses the relevant provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
