    "It has been demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that the proposed use of the application site as a restaurant/cafe and private consultation rooms would fall within Class E of the Use Classes Order 1987 (as amended) and would therefore be lawful.\r",
    "Condition 10 (Sustainable Drainage Scheme) of planning permission 23/01697/FUL states: \rNo building hereby permitted shall be occupied until the sustainable drainage scheme for the site has been completed in accordance with the submitted details and evidence (photographs and/or installation contracts) submitted for approval by the Lead Local Flood Authority. The sustainable drainage scheme shall be managed and maintained thereafter in accordance with the agreed management and maintenance plan. \r\rReason: To prevent the development from increasing the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere, in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer response: It is noted that the Council's Flood Risk Officer raised objections to the proposal: \r\rPlanning approval was obtained for the discharge of surface water to the Thames Water surface water sewer. SuDS in the form of an attenuation tank, with a storage capacity of 163 m3 was proposed to contribute to the surface water drainage system.\r\rFor the discharge of this condition, the applicant has provided photographs evidencing the installation of the proposed attenuation tanks. However, the installation contracts have not been submitted. We request that the installation contracts of the attenuation tanks be provided to confirm that the required volumes (163 m3 ) were installed as approved. \r\rTherefore, the LLFA does not recommend the discharge of condition 11. More information is still needed to confirm that the drainage system has been built as approved. \r\rAs such it is considered that insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would not increase the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere, in conflict with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The checklist has 'No' in biodiversity checklist, fire statement and time stamp photo, since we have received all those documents, please revise the validation checklist with correct information.\r\rThe new local list and validation checklists can be obtained via the council's website- https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications."
