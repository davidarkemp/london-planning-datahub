    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would provide satisfactory living conditions for current and/or future occupiers of the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and D6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of adequate cycle parking facilities, would fail to promote sustainable transport. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the lack of off-street car parking facilities, would be highly likely to lead to inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets, which would, in turn, compromise highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that adequate waste and recycling facilities could be provided within the site. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy CS9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Condition 15 states:\rThe development hereby approved shall not be implemented other than in accordance with the recommendations contained within the Preliminary Ecological Assessment (PEA) Report (Hone Ecology, March 2023), the Bat Survey (Plan Ecology Ltd, May-June 2023) and the Preliminary Roost Assessment Outbuildings September 2023.\r\rPrior to commencement of development, a scheme to enhance the nature conservation interest of the site, to include the mitigation and enhancements set out in sections 5 and 6 of the Preliminary Ecological Assessment (PEA) Report and section 5 of the Bat Survey (Plan Ecology Ltd, May June 2023, shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the local planning authority. These measures shall include:\r\r- Any artificial lighting should be inline with the recent bat conservation trust Guidance Note\rGN08/23.\r- Mature trees should be retained where possible. Tree protection measures should be\rimplemented according to BS 5837:2012\r- To improve bird nesting potential of the site two bird boxes suitable for species such as house\rsparrow or swift to be incorporated into the new build properties.\r- The creation of log piles within the site boundaries area to provide hibernacula to local reptiles\rand amphibians, and shelter for invertebrates\r- To increase biodiversity and improve foraging potential for bats, hedgehogs and invertebrate and nesting potential for birds, native species hedge planting should be introduced as plot boundaries between the dwellings.\r- Minimising light and noise pollution on the site. In particular minimising the hours the construction\rsite is lit.\r- Bat brick on the exterior of each of the new buildings to provide bat roost potential.\r- Hedgehog holes should be installed within the boundary fences to enable hedgehog movement, and wilder areas included within the landscaping\r\rThe approved scheme shall be implemented in full prior to beneficial occupation of the development (or commencement of any work on site where relevant to the construction phase).\r\rReason: To safeguard the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site, in accordance with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. The scheme is required before development commences because it would affect the design of subsequent elements of the development.\r\r\rOfficer Assessment: The submitted information highlights some of the recommendations of the previously submitted Preliminary Ecological Appraisal which should be carried forward as part of the development. However, no tangible details of many of the required measures have been submitted. For example, in relation to the necessary 'bat bricks' there are no definitive details of what product would be installed or where. Instead, a Batbox or Bat tube are presented as potential options. In relation to the planting of native species, it is stated that hazel, beech, hornbeam and guelder rose 'could' be planted, however, there are no details of specimen size, the number of plants and where they would be planted. The submitted information is not detailed enough and, in its current form, would not ensure the delivery of all the measures required by the condition.\r\rTo address the identified issues a Plan will required which shows the site (including site boundaries) and where each of the requirement biodiversity enhancements/mitigations will be installed. For example, the location of where the bat boxes will be installed, and at what height, would need to be annotated on the required plan. Similarly, hedgehog holes would need to be shown on the relevant boundaries. Where external lights are to be installed, these should be indicated on the Plan and stated as complying with the relevant guidance. The proposed hedges must be shown on the required plan, the species of plants annotated on the plan. \r\rThe details submitted pursuant to Condition 15 are therefore hereby refused.\r\r",
    "You are reminded that condition 28 stipulates that no building hereby permitted shall be occupied until evidence (including dated photographs) is submitted to demonstrate that the nature conservation mitigation and enhancements measures\ragreed as part of condition 15 have been implemented and completed in accordance with the agreed details.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant officers and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.",
