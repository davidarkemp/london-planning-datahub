    "The proposed erection of single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal \rErection of piggyback loft conversion\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. Five representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- First floor balcony not characteristic to the area\r- Loss of privacy and noise pollution as a result of the proposed balcony\r- Light pollution \r- Right of light\r\rAny matters controlled under non-planning laws such as right to light are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment.\r\rThe remaining concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed piggyback extension would be set back approximately 4m from the front elevation of the house and the height of the eaves would be raised by approximately 1.3m.\r\rHowever, considering the siting of the proposal in relation to the adjoining property Flats 195 A and 195B (this property is significantly lower that the application site) and that the gap between the 1st floor side elevation of the host dwelling and this property would exceed the recommended maximum of 2.1m (it would be approximately 5m (as per submitted block plan) and given that the ground levels are sloping down towards the rear (west), it is considered that the proposal would appear as a dominant and disproportionate addition to the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. \r\rIt is noted that piggyback extensions are not characteristic to Park Road. As the proposal would be highly visible with the street scene (due to the separation gap), it would be also visible from Wyndham Road, and given its increase in height resulting in dominant appearance, it is considered to adversely affect the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area, contrary to Policy Guidance 40 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe applicant suggests that the proposal would be visually a better option then roof extensions secured via permitted development rights. However, given the increase in eaves height and therefore increase in bulk and mass of the extension, the proposal is considered to have a greater, detrimental impact on the host dwelling and the surrounding properties. \r\rWith regards to the additional balcony, as the property benefits from the ground and first floor balconies, an additional one would be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the dwelling. \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character, which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an adverse impact to the host property would not relate well to the host property and have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  result in harm to the significance of the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns raised within the written representations (including a letter from a Senior Right of Light Surveyor) regarding the impact of the proposal on the amenities of the adjoining occupiers. \r\rWith regards to the adjoining property No 199, it is noted that the host dwelling already fails the 25 degree rule in relation to the Velux rooflights that serve the kitchen, therefore the proposal would not significantly change the existing situation. The received letter from a Senior Right of Light Surveyor objecting to the proposal fails to clarify if the velux windows are the principal (the only) habitable openings to the kitchen area. \r\rWith regards to the adjoining flats at No 195, their principal habitable openings are located on the side, north elevation. While the existing host dwelling as well as the proposal fails the 25 degree rule in relation to the openings to the ground floor flat, the proposal is likely to fail the 25 degree rule in relation to the principle  habitable openings serving bedrooms to the first floor flat. \r\rIt is noted that the applicant has not submitted any information relating to the proposal and its impact in terms of daylight in relation to the adjoining properties. \r\rAs the property benefits from the balconies to the rear, an additional balcony, given its siting and obscure glazed panels to the sides, in isolation, would not result in an unacceptable loss of privacy or an undue overlooking  in reaction to the existing properties. \r\rThe proposal, due to its scale, is not considered to result in unacceptable light pollution. \rAny new openings and rooflights above the ground floor would be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7 when measured from an internal floor area. \r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site address in the application form is '155 Surbiton Hill Park, Surbiton, KT5 8EJ', which is categorised as shop in our record. The proposal consits work on upper floor flat which has different site address. Therefore please amend the application form with all the site addresses, where the works are to be proposed.\r\rPlease find the attached application form."
