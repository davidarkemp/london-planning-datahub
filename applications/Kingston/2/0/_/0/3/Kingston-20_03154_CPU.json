    "The applicant has not demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the construction of a winter garden would not constitute a balcony/raised platform, thereby conflicting with B.1.(e) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that that the expanse of glazing associated with the winter garden, the hanging plants and the sedum roof would result in a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse, thereby conflicting with B.2.(a) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application seeks to obtain a Certificate of Lawfulness for the conversion of 1 x 4 bed residential unit to 2 x 1 bed residential units. The application is made under section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and is relying on the use being in existence for 10 or more years in line with the time limits set for lawful development/uses under section 171 B of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) \r\rThe applicant has submitted in support of their application \r\r- A set of plans to show a layout pre conversion and post conversion\r\rRelevant planning history\rNone\r\rNo further evidence/supporting documentation has been submitted. \r\rThe onus of proof in a LDC application is firmly on the applicant. While the LPA should always co-operate with an applicant seeking information they may hold about the planning status of land, by making records readily available, they need not go to great lengths to show that the use, operations, or failure to comply with a condition, specified in the application, is, or is not, lawful. While LPAs are statutorily required to maintain the planning register, this is not a complete record of the planning status of all land in their area. In many cases, the applicant for a certificate will be best placed to produce information about the present, and any previous, activities taking place on the land, including a copy of any planning permission he may hold. Some information, especially about the history of any unauthorised activity on the land, will be particularly within the applicant's knowledge.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted any evidence which corroborates their statement in the deposited application that the use of the premises  a conversion from 1 x 4 bed residential unit to 2 x 1 bed flats has been in existence for a period of 4 or more years. The deposit of plans showing a layout pre and post conversion in itself is not enough to satisfy the LPA of the length of time the use may have been in existence.\r\rTherefore, officers are not satisfied that the applicant has clearly demonstrated, on the balance of probability, that the claim is lawful, and that the use sought, a conversion from 1 x 4 bed residential unit to 2 x 1 bed flats, is lawful. \r\rAs such the LPA would require a fuller detailed submission to address its concerns. The fact that a LDC may be refused because the onus of proof is not discharged by the applicant does not preclude the submission of a further application if better evidence is subsequently available. A refusal to issue a LDC is therefore not necessarily conclusive that something is not lawful: it may merely mean that, so far, insufficient evidence has been presented to satisfy the LPA that the use, operation or activity is lawful. \r\rIt is concluded at this stage the information submitted to date is insufficient to allow the LPA to issue a certificate.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\rTrees situated within the site are subject to Tree Preservation Order.  \rThe site falls within the Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing bin storage, erection of a single storey carport. Replacement and height alteration of an existing entrance gate. Replacement of an existing rear patio door to create level threshold. Fenestration alteration.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rTree Officer - no objections.\rMaldens And Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objections\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on Heritage Assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the previous scheme ref 23/01633/HOU (Demolition of existing bin storage, erection of a single storey carport. Replacement of existing entrance gate. Fenestration alteration.) refused due to the following reason:\r\rInsufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed carport would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the surrounding trees which contribute positively to the significance of the Coombe Hill Conservation Area. It has not been demonstrated that the proposals would preserve the character and appearance of the Coombe Hill Conservation Area and that the proposals would not harm any protected trees and the development is therefore contrary to Policies D3, HC1 and G7 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8,  DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rIt is noted that the RBK's Tree Officer raised no objections to the proposal, therefore it is considered that it would not adversely affect the protected trees which contribute positively to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and significance of the Coombe Hill Conservation Area.\r\rWith regards to the proposed timber carport, given its scale and siting would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Due to the existing greenery along the front boundary, it would not be directly visible within the street and therefore it would not have a significant  impact on the existing street scene. \r\rThe proposed minor alterations to the the front boundary (the raised height of the gate) due to its scale and design are considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed alterations to fenestration comprising new aluminium doors and lower level threshold to the rear elevation at ground floor level and a new replacement (frosted) window to the side elevation at the first floor level are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application site falls within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as the estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course.\r\rWhile the proposed car port  and alterations to fenestration to the host dwelling would not be readily visible within the street view, the proposed alterations to the gate would be directly visible within the existing street scene. Given the modest scale of the proposal, the proposed material and design, it is considered that the proposals would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, therefore the proposed development would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 200 to 204 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe submitted information demonstrates that the proposals would not adversely affect the protected trees. It is noted that the RBK's Tree Officer raised no objections to the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the siting and scale of the proposed carport and the existing greenery along the common boundaries it is considered that this element of the proposal would not have significant impact on the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property No 147 Coombe Lane West by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposed alterations to fenestration at the ground floor level to the rear elevation and the proposed obscure (frosted) glazing to the existing side window at the first floor level given their siting, scale and separation distances are considered not to have significant impact on the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two additional, off street car parking spaces are considered to be of sufficient size to be used for car parking purposes. As such, this element of the proposal  would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "We have received existing, as-existing and proposed plans and elevation, we require existing and proposed plans and elevations. Please amend the drawings with correct labelling.",
    "The proposal is for change of use, therefore the fee require for the application is £578.00. We acknowledge the receipt of £258.00, please pay the outstanding balance of £320.00."
