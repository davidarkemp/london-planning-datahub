    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling within the Fishponds Park Conservation Area.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rConsultees\rSurbiton CAAC - Objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Paragraph 4.26 of the Residential Design SPD states that proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This becomes true when assessing the submitted details. No.10 Mayberry Place forms the end of a 5-dwelling row of terraced properties and whilst officers acknowledge that No. 6 Mayberry Place does benefit from development to the side elevation, it does not appear as prominent in the streetscene e as the proposed gable end would.  \r\rThe proposed dormer extension would also be visible in the streetscene as the property is at the end of the row of terraced dwellings. The applicant proposes a dormer that would appear larger and would not respect the host dwelling in regard to style. Additionally, the proposed dormer would be incongruous in the immediate vicinity.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, massing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 210 of the NPPF 2024 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rParagraphs 202 to 210 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above the Surbiton CAAC has raised an objection to the proposed development and stated the following: \r\r'The proposed gable and large dormer significantly change the roof line visible from the street and this will impact the character of the CA.'\r\rThe special architectural and historic interest of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area can be summarised as: The former mid 18th century estate of The Fishponds, with the surviving core of the original house and part of the grounds laid out as a 20th century park. In addition there is  a cohesive set of late 19th Century, 2 storey terraced artisan cottages, with small front gardens.\r\rAs previously mentioned, the proposed development would not be in general keeping and would not maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area or host dwelling.\r\rIn accordance with the NPPF (2024), any less than substantial harm must be weighed against the public benefits of the scheme. In this case, the development is a householder extension. It is not considered that any wider public benefits would arise from the proposals which would outweigh the less than substantial harm.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area and would cause less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

Therefore, the proposed development is unlikely to result in effects on parking. \r\rAny issues relating to the above and noise issues should be reported to the Council's Environmental Health Team.\r \rOfficers note the concerns raised regarding inaccurate drawings, however the submitted details only provide information concerning the first floor rear/side extension and no details have been provided regarding the outbuilding towards the rear of the garden. For the avoidance of doubt, the following assessment only relates to the erection of a first-floor side/rear extension.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes a first-floor side extension that would extend beyond the rear elevation by approximately 3.3m, above the existing ground floor side and rear extension. The existing dwelling has a cat-slide roof with two dormers, the proposal would consist of the removal of these dormers and construction of a larger first floor extension with a part flat part pitched roof design. The drawings demonstrate that whilst most of the cat-slide roof would be covered, the applicant maintains the front eave element of the cat-slide roof.\r\rThe proposed first-floor side/rear extension would be acceptable as it would still remain subordinate to the host dwelling, the applicant maintains approximately 1m from the front elevation and the boundary shared with neighbouring property number No.24 Kneller Road. Addtionally, the pitched roof element would respect the host dwelling original roof form and the applicant proposes render to match the host dwelling.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not provided any details demonstrating that the proposed development would not breach the BRE 45-degree rule. Therefore, officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The proposed first-floor extension would not breach the 45-degree rule in regards to the closest window on the first floor at No.24 Kneller Road. No. 24 has a window facing the application site and a window close to the rear elevation which serves as a bathroom (non-habitable space).\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

Subsequently, the applicant has amended the proposed development.\r\rRegarding character and appearance, the proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 4m and a flat roof height of approximately 3.5m from the proposed 600mm high patio falling outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD. However, the proposal would not be visible in the streetscene and would have matching material to aid in maintaining the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area.\r\rThe applicant demonstrates that the proposal involves the installation of a higher fence on the boundary shared with No.6 Eton Avenue. Whilst this would be a change clearly visible to No.6 Eton Avenue, it would not cause significant harm to the host dwelling or wider area, as it would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above the applicant previously submitted an application (ref: 24/02583/HOU) which was refused for the following reason:\r\r1. The proposed development, by reason of its combined depth, height and siting hard up against the shared boundary would result in an overbearing appearance and an undue sense of enclosure to the occupants of neighbouring property, No. 6 Eton Avenue. Thereby conflicting with conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge that the applicant has provided further details of the proposed raised fence, the submitted details demonstrate that the proposed single-storey rear extension has not been amended. Therefore, the reason for refusal has not been sufficiently addressed and the following assessment still remain:\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 6 and No.10 Eton Avenue, in regard to loss of light.\r\rThe applicant proposes to reduce the height of the existing patio from 1.1m to 600mm and extend it beyond the proposed rear extension by 3m. Whilst officers acknowledge that the applicant aims to maintain the privacy of neighbouring property No.6 Eton Avenue by increasing the height of the fence on the northeastern boundary, the combination of the proposed rear extension and raised fence would subsequently cause a sense of enclosure and would appear overbearing. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and undue sense of enclosure.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comments: Officers acknowledge the concern raised regarding trees, however, there are no protected trees on site and by common law, property owners are allowed to remove branches of unproctected trees that cross over onto their property from a neighbouring property or piece of land, without the permission of the tree owner. Branches or roots that 'trespass' across legal boundaries can be lawfully removed back to the boundary only (not beyond the boundary).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

Erection of a single storey rear/infill extension. Refused on 27.03.2024 for the following reasons:\r\r1. Due to the submission of inconsistent and contradictory plans officers are unable to appropriately assess the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the property or the wider area. Therefore, it is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development, in conflict with the Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\r2. By reason of height and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No.13 Beech Grove by reason of overbearing appearance and would lead to an unacceptable loss of daylight and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposal would have a total depth of approximately 5.5m falling outside Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. However, the proposed extension would not exceed the depth of the existing single-storey rear extension and would have a reasonable total pitched roof height of approximately 4m that slopes towards neighboring property No.13 Beech Grove and ends with a height of approximately 2.7m. Additionally, the proposed development would not be visible from the streetscene and subordinate and proportionate to the existing dwelling.\r\rOverall, the proposed extension would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

While there is a permission for an extension to the adjoining neighbour, there is no requirement for this permission to be implemented/completed. As such, Officers must assess the impact of the proposals against the existing situation.\r\rThe previous application was refused as the initially proposed development would have adversely affected the neighbouring properties' amenities (No.13) by way of a loss of light and overbearing appearance.

The assessment demonstrates that the proposed extensions in relation to neighbouring property No.13 Beech Grove would no longer adversely affect their amenities by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of daylight to their closest ground floor principal habitable room window (dining room).\r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A).

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the part conversion of an existing garage into a habitable space, erection of a single storey rear and first floor side / rear extension. Alteration to side roof. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r13/14976/HOU - Erection of single storey rear, side and front extensions. Granted 06.12.13\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact upon Highways\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval  for the part conversion of an existing garage into habitable space,  erection of single storey  rear and first floor side/ rear extension. Alteration to side roof.\r\rAt ground floor level, the proposed single storey rear extension would be the same depth as the existing single storey rear extension  and be positioned in alignment with the  existing rear building line as the neighbouring property.  The proposed first floor side/ rear extension would be positioned within the ground floor built footprint.  The separation gap between neighbouring properties would be maintained at 1m and proposed roof form would relate well  to the existing dwelling\r\rThe proposed  part conversion of the existing garage  into a habitable space would be situated within the existing footprint of the property and measure the same width and depth therefore would create minimal impact on the surrounding character.\r\rIn addition to the above, the proposal also includes retention of a garage door albeit smaller in scale than the existing and the installation of a window which would be similar in style to the existing windows on the dwelling. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of  part conversion of the existing garage into a habitable space, erection of a single story rear and first floor side/ rear extension together with alteration to side roof, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety  and ensure that they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application involves the  part conversion of the  existing garage space. Based on the existing floor plans, it does not appear to be of a size capable of fitting a modern car. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/ driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the loss of the garage would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rThe proposals would result in the loss of internal storage space currently capable of storing cycles. The plans do not explicitly show any replacement cycle parking as part of the proposals. Notwithstanding, Officers consider that there would be sufficient space either to the front or rear of the property to accommodate a purpose built enclosure to the required standards to comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021, or as an alternative  the part retained garage space . A condition to this effect would be attached to any grant of planning permission to require the applicant to supply details of cycle parking facilities to the Council for approval.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
    "The site comprises an end-terraced dwelling. The site is located within the Riverside North Conservation Area, the Area of Archaeological Significance Stevens Eyots And Kingston Thames Riverside and the Thames - Side Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbour Consultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received\r\rConsultee Responses\r- Malden And Coombe CAAC: No Objection\r- Tree and Landscape Officer: No Objection (subject to Condition)\r- Highways: No Objection (subject to Condition)\r\rRelevant planning History \r- 24/02493/HOU. Demolition of garage and erection of single storey side extension, new driveway relaid and expanded to create level access. Erection of single storey store to front, and single storey rear extension. Internal and external alterations. Refused on 27.01.2025.\r\r1. The proposed development would be incongruous and would not respect the character or appearance of the existing dwelling or the wider area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. Therefore, the proposals fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area, contrary to Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\r2. The proposed crossover would result in the loss of a significant amount of grass verge. The loss of the grass verge would have a detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area. The development is therefore contrary to Policies DM 6 and DM 10 of the RBK Core Strategy.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- The impact of the development on protected trees.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application which was refused as the initially proposed storage to the front of the dwelling would have been highly incongruous due to its location and clear visibility in the streetscene. The applicant has now amended the proposed development by relocating the bike store to the side elevation of the dwelling. It is considered that the applicant has sufficiently addressed the concerns initially raised in the planning application ref: 24/02493/HOU as it would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rThe applicant proposes to demolish to existing garage to the western elevation of the dwelling to erect a new single-storey side extension. The development would also include storage at the front of the site alongside a new driveway and a single-storey rear extension. \r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would have a depth of approximately 3m which would be an infill next to the existing rear extension. It would have a total parapet roof height of approximately 3m, in line with policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. In addition, the proposed rear extension would not be visible in the streetscene and would be minor in scale. \r\rAfter the demolition of the existing garage, the applicant proposes to erect a side extension with a height of approximately 4.55m and a width of approximately 6.2m. Whilst officers would prefer the use of timber for windows and doors as stated by the Kingston Town CAAC, officers would not consider the use of UPVC to be significantly harmful to the character and appearance of the wider area. Generally, the extension would still resemble the existing garage regarding scale and would be on balance acceptable. \r\rConsidering the above, the proposed development is acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Planning application ref: 24/02493/HOU was also refused due to the proposal involving the partial removal of a grass verge that has a depth of more than 2m in depth. This would fall outside the guidelines of the council's Vehicle Crossover Policy 2018. \r\rThe applicant has now reduced the amount of grass verge that would be removed as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe council highways officers were consulted on the proposed development and raised no objection (subject to conditions) to the submitted details stating: 'The applicant is not proposing any changes to the existing crossover; therefore, Highways has no further comments'\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as:- A linear area whose form and mature landscape is influenced by the River Thames, alongside which lie ancient riverside estates, important 19th century public works that established Canbury Gardens, a group of large Victorian/Edwardian houses and late Victorian boathouses fronting the river.\r\rThe Kingston Town CAAC have raise no objection to the proposed development as they see no material impact on the Riverside North Conservation Area. \r\rAs noted above, the proposed development would be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD, it would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such, given that no significant harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers concluded that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area or the  Thames - Side Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies a similar footprint to the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rTrees\rParagraph 180 of the NPPF 2023 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by, among other things, recognising the benefits of trees and woodlands.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees there should be adequate replacement based on the existing value of the benefits of the trees removed, determined by, for example, i-tree or CAVAT or another appropriate valuation system. The planting of additional trees should generally be included in new developments - particularly large-canopied species which provide a wider range of benefits because of the larger surface area of their canopy.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected. Where trees are to be lost through development, the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided\r\rOfficer Comment: The council's tree officer raises no objections to the removal of T3 and T4, subject to the conditions; an arboricultural report, tree protection plan and condition for a landscaping plan for four replacement trees, as part of our 2-for-1 replacement tree and policies G7 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
