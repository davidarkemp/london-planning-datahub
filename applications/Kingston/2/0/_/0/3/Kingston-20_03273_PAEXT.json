    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In relation to work adjacent to Network Rail assets:\r1. The developer must contact the Wessex asset protection team and sign an asset protection agreement before proceeding with any design or construction works alongside NR infrastructure. SAPE will specify further safety and engineering conditions as necessary.\r\r2. It may be necessary to enhance or renew Network rail (NR) existing boundary fencing as a result of the development in order to reduce the risk of trespass and possible vandalism. New screening purposes fence must be independent of NR fencing and allow room for maintenance of both fences. \r\r3. Party Wall etc Act 1996. Where works are proposed adjacent to the railway it may be necessary to serve the appropriate notices on NR and their Tenants under the Party Wall etc Act 1996. Developers should consult with NR at an early stage of the preparation of details of their development on Party Wall matter.\r\r4. NR accepts no liability in respect of noise and vibration. Developer should undertake his own investigations to establish any level of noise and vibration likely to originate from the operational of the railway, and design their mitigation measures accordingly.\r\r5. All works, both temporary and permanent, should be designed and constructed so that they will have no influence on the stability of NR's structures and adjoining land.\r\r6. Vibro-compaction will not be permitted, especially in the vicinity of structures, embankments or cutting slopes.\r\r7. NR advise that the use of bored, cast in-situ reinforced concrete piles are recommended. Normally these have no detrimental vibration effects during construction.\r\r8. All structures should be situated at a minimum distance of two metres from NR's boundary fence and at a sufficient distance to enable construction to proceed without, in the NR Engineer's opinion, the risk of affecting the normal and safe running of the railway. This clearance will also enable construction and maintenance to proceed without the need to enter on to NR's property. Please note that unless previous safety protection has been arranged, access on to NR property will not be permitted for any activity associated with any works.\r\r9. All new construction should be sufficiently clear to the boundary, and all foundations should be designed such that they do not impose any surcharge on railway cutting slopes or structures. In addition, it should be borne in mind that cutting slopes could be subject to erosion through the effects of weathering, and all new construction should be at a sufficient distance from the slope to take this into account. At no time should an embankment supporting the railway be cut into or built upon.\r\r10. NR reserves the right to request the screening of any light, including vehicular lights and light reflected by building cladding, which may interfere with the sighting of signalling apparatus and / or train drivers' vision on approaching trains. Large areas of Red or Green cladding or painted structure that face on to the railway could affect the sighting of track signals. Large areas of reflective cladding or mirror type glazing could affect the sighting of track signals in the vicinity of the Railway.\r\r11. Any scaffold which is to be constructed adjacent to the railway must be erected in such a manner that at no time will any poles over-sail or fall onto the railway. Black protective netting around the scaffold may need to be installed. A Method Statement for constructing and dismantling the scaffold will need to be provided for acceptance. Scaffolding may need to be erected under a track closure (possession) of the railway because of the dangers to trains and from the electrified conductor rail. A minimum of sixteen weeks notice is required for shared possessions and thirty two weeks for sole possessions to arrange any possessions of the track.\r\r12. Any cranes or other plant to be used on site must be positioned and operate in such a way that, in the event of mishandling or failure of any part of the equipment or subsidence of the ground supporting the equipment, they will not move or fall within three metres of the nearest rail. Their loads or jibs should not under any circumstances over-sail NR's property.\r\r13. Full details of any tower cranes to be used on site should be submitted for approval, together with a plan showing the relevant jib radii. The cranes (and any other plant) must be positioned in such a way that in the event of mishandling or failure of any part of the equipment or subsidence of the ground supporting the equipment, they will not move or fall within three metres of the nearest rail. Their loads or jibs should not under any circumstances over-sail NR's property. A Method Statement must be prepared for NR's approval, it may be necessary to down-rate the crane capacity by 25% to reduce the risk of failure.\r\r14. All costs incurred by NR in connection with the Works should be reimbursed by the Developer. NR will require the Developer to enter into an Asset Protection Agreement with NR and either place a purchase order or make payment before work commences if called upon to do so.\r\r15. NR requires to be advised of the geotechnical information regarding the site and be assured that whatever construction method is used is suitable. Written confirmation is required stating that the integrity of the railway formation or structures will not be impaired by excavation, piling or other construction methods.\r\r16. Details of excavations for foundations, etc., within 15 metres of NR boundary are to be submitted to SAPE for prior approval. Excavations are not to affect the structural integrity of Network Rail's formation or structures. Stability calculations will be required to prove this where necessary. Calculations to be supported by independent design check certification and supporting geological information.\r\r17. There is to be no dewatering adjacent to or under NR property or structures unless it is unavoidable, in which case the following is required:-\ra. Settlement and stability calculations for the railway corridor for all stages of construction/dewatering.\rb. Calculations to be supported by independent design check certification.\rc. Monitoring of ground and track levels is to be carried out regularly while dewatering is taking place and for at least 2 weeks after it ceases. \r",
    "PLEASE READ CAREFULLY:\r\rOn the 1st May 2024 the Council adopted a new Validation Local List. Please ensure that your application submission includes all the necessary documentation as required by the new local list. \r\rThen please complete and submit a Validation Checklist - Section 3. The new Validation  Local List and checklists can be obtained via the council's website: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\r\rThe LPA will not conduct any validation checks until the correct Checklist has been submitted. Upon receipt of a completed Checklist, the application will be assigned to a validation officer to review. Please do not simply state N/A in the checklist without a written justification.\r\rIf you need to make any changes to your application please try to do this via the Planning Portal website where possible. If that is not possible please send amended documents via the email address quoted in this letter.\r"
