    "The proposed boundary wall replacement falls within Schedule 2, Part 2, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension\r\rIt is noted that a previous application 22/03752/HOU dated 06.03.2023 was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1) The proposed extension by reason of its height and depth along the shared boundary with No. 87 would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No. 87 Wolsey Drive and would be overbearing and result in an undue sense of enclosure.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r2) It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rIt is reasonable that reason 2 could be secured by way of a condition, however, the first reason for refusal would still need to be addressed.\r\rFollowing this application 23/00983/HOU dated 22.06.2023 was refused for the following reason;\r\r1) The proposed extension by reason of its height and depth along the shared boundary with No. 87 would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No. 87 Wolsey Drive and would be overbearing and result in an undue sense of enclosure.  As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficers have been unable to identify any changes to the plans submitted following both refusals. \r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and therefore, no adverse impacts on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that No. 87 Wolsey Drive has recently been granted permission 23/00377/HOU dated 05.04.2023 for the erection of a single storey rear extension which is a material planning consideration. However, It has not been demonstrated that the neighbouring extension has been implemented, or indeed completed. Furthermore, there is no obligation for the neighbour to implement or complete their permission. \r\rThe proposed development would be situated to the rear of the existing dwellinghouse. Due to the combined depth and height of the proposed extension hard up to the boundary (3m flat roof height for a depth of approximately 3.6m along the shared boundary), officers consider that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight and outlook for the closest habitable room window at neighbouring No. 87 Wolsey Drive, also resulting in an undue sense of enclosure.  Regarding No. 83,  the proposed extension would not project beyond the rear-most elevation such that there would be no significant adverse impact on neighbouring amenity. The proposed extension has not been reduced in any way through the submission of this application in order to alleviate the above issues\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 87 Wolsey Drive by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy and the previous reasons for refusal have not been addressed.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficers Comments: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
