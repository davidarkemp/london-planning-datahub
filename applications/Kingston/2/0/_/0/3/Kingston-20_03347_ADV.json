    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of single storey rear extension and side car port and erection of single storey rear/side extension\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and 2 letters from one address, neither objecting or support the application has been received stating;\r- Effects on trees\r\rThe main concerns raise would relate to party wall agreements and the applicant will be reminded of their duty to the The Party Wall Act 1996 should permission be granted.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r - Sustainable travel; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed side extension has been set back from the front elevation so would not be highly visible within the streetscene. It is also noted that single storey side extensions are a common feature within the area. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, the principal properties to be considered are No. 69 and No. 73 Alexandra Drive. Officers note that the replacement rear extension would be deeper that the existing. However, due to the limited eaves height along the boundary with No. 73, No further harm has been identified with regards to loss of daylight/sunlight than already exists. With regards to No. 69 Alexandra Drive, the set back of the side extension would ensure that a terracing effect would not be created. Due to the existing situation with the garages, no harm to daylight/sunlight has been identified either. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSustainable Travel\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed development would result in the loss of access to the rear garden from the front of the property and it has not been demonstrated how secure cycle parking could be accommodated on site. However, it is considered that further information regarding this could be secured by condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
