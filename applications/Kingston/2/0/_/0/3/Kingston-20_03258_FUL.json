    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a large detached dwelling within the Southborough Conservation Area. The significance of the Southborough Conservation Area is as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash. \r\rProposal\rConversion of  an existing garage into a habitable space, demolition of an existing storm porch and erection of a  single storey side porch extension. Fenestration alteration\r\rConsultation\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received\r\rSurbiton CAAC - Objection - Replacement windows should match existing and be timber framed, white colour.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- Impact on a heritage asset;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed garage conversion and demolition and rebuild of the storm porch would be considered acceptable subject to the use of materials to match the existing which would be secured by condition should permission be granted. With regards to the changes to the fenestration, Insufficient information has been provided. In order to fully assess the impact of the proposed windows within a conservation area, officers would expect confirmation of the proposed materials for window frames (including their manufacturer's specification, colour and texture) and also further details of the windows, including any aprons, sills, moulding's, heads, jambs, transoms, mullions, lintels or reveals ect.  Officer have therefore been unable to confirm that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As stated above, officers have been unable to establish if there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore an impact on the Southborough Conservation Area and have been unable to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A).  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
