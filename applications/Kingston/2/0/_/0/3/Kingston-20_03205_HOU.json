    "The proposed extensions would not be proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwelling and would appear bulky, visually intrusive and incongruous within the street scene and when viewed from neighbouring properties. The lack of set-back from the boundary with No. 263 Richmond Road to the south would fail to preserve visual separation between these properties were No. 263 to extend in a similar manner. The proposals are therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would incorporate appropriate flood resistance and resilience measures given its location within Fluvial Flood Zone 2 (medium probability of flooding). It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not be at undue risk of flooding or increase flood risk on-site or elsewhere, contrary to Policy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The combined effect of the excessive scale and depth of the proposed single and two storey rear extensions would be overbearing to No. 267 Richmond Road to the north and would result in an undue sense of enclosure, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)."
