    "The proposed development, by virtue of its siting forward of the established building line along Balmoral Road and its excessive scale and height, would create an incongruous and unduly prominent addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and incongruous within the street scene and would detract from the character and appearance of both the host property and the wider area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012\r\r\r\r\r",
    "Officers Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Flood Zone 2.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension, and rear dormer roof extension with Juliet balcony and installation of 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alterations to existing roof. Changes to fenestrations.\r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Flood Risk; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed alterations to the main roof and installation of front rooflights is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding properties.\r\rWith regards to the proposed rear dormer roof extension, it is acknowledged that it would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended set down distance from the roof ridge. However, considering its siting and modest scale it is considered to be a proportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. It is noted that the proposed dormer would be similar to the existing one at the adjoining property No 21.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be of irregular shape and it would measure approximately 3.5m deep along the common boundary with No 21. I would be of similar rear building line as No 25. Given its siting and the proposed eaves height of approximately 2.9m, it is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is noted that the adjoining property No 25 benefits from planning permission ref no 22/00972/HOU for 'demolition of existing detached garage and erection of two storey side, part two storey/part single storey rear, single storey front extension, erection of rear dormer roof extension with juliet balcony and installation of 2 nos front and 1 no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion' and that building works have commenced. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension given its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers at No 25 in terms of unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight or loss of privacy. The approved windows to the side elevation at the ground floor level at No 25 under planning permission 22/00972/HOU are secondary habitable windows or non habitable windows, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. \r\rThe proposed windows to the side elevation that would face No 25 are situated above 1.7m when measured from the floor level, therefore it is considered that they would not result in an undue overlooking or an unacceptable loss of privacy in relation to No 25. \r\rWith regards to No 21, it has been demonstrated on the submitted drawings that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. Given the proposed depth of the extension of approximately 3.5m along the common boundary with No 21 and the proposed eaves height of approximately 2.9m, it is considered that the proposal would not appear as overbearing. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Assessment submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Strategy Statement which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved  Planning Fire Strategy Statement and thereafter maintained.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
