    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its design and excessive bulk, scale and mass would result in a feature that would not relate well to the original property and would be unacceptable in terms of character and appearance.

    "The height and depth of the single storey rear extension would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of the adjoining property, No. 54 Guildford Avenue by creating an undue sense of enclosure, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 Core Strategy (2012) and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "In the absence of a completed legal agreement to preclude future occupants from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety and would not result in inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets and negatively contribute to on-street car parking pressure in the area, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "Due to the loss of a three bedroom family sized unit and the proposed development's failure to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types to meet the identified housing needs of the Borough and the applicant's failure to demonstrate that the delivery of 30% of the units as three bedroom units would be unsuitable or unviable, the development is contrary to Policies DM13 and DM14 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the future occupiers of plot 1 would be provided with private outdoor amenity space that is readily accessible from their property, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposal would provide a poor standard of accommodation for the future occupants of plot 1 due to the close proximity of boundary features and poor levels of natural light and a poor standard of accommodation to future occupants of plot 2 due to the poor outlook from the bedroom. As such the proposal fails to comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan, 2016 and Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential land. The site is beiong development for a single residential dwellinghouse.\r\rProposal \r\rSection 73a application to amend planning permission 19/01776/FUL. The changes sought and for consideration only are \r\r- alteration to roof from hip to gable with two rear dormers and installation of 2nos. front rooflights.\r\rConsultation\r\r2 objections received and summarised as follows\r\r- ownership/inaccurate red line\r- Impact on character and appearance of the area\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: The officer assessment assess the areas of concern raised. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 189 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on designated and non designated heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated or non designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal constitutes a proposed amendment to planning permission 19/01776/FUL. The application seeks to change the roof form from hip to gable and add two dormers and rooflights. The proposal does not fully follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD. \r\rIt is also noted that the parent permission has removed the PD rights in regards to extensions including roof extensions without the express consent from the LPA. This does not preclude such extensions and is not necessarily an indication that such extensions would not be appropriate or accpetable but that the LPA does reserve the right to control and consider such extensions and decide whether such extensions are acceptable.\r\rThe LPA notes that there are various roof additions including dormers of differing styles in Rydal Gardens and note the immediate adjacent property 8A to have a gable styled roof which have somewhat diluted the original character and appearance of the area which forms part of the non-designated heritage asset the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rIt is considered that in this instance and in the context of its surroundings the changes to planning permission 19/01776/FUL would on balance result in a development that would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and the proposed changes would not have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area or the non-designated heritage asset the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered given the nature and  siting, orientation and distance form the neighbouring properties that the proposed changes to planning permission 19/01776/FUL would not result in a development that would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\r\rA condition is recommended to secure and approve a fire safety strategy for the resultant development to ensure that the proposed development would accord with Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rThe objections in part relate to the validity of the ownership of the site in relation to the applicant and the correct drawing and identification of the site and the red line on the site location plan and address point. The applicant has provided confirmation of the site address evidencing a street naiming and numbering entry and the title deeds from land registry showing proof of ownership of the land and the holder of the title and the extent of land that the title covers. The LPA has no reason at this time to dispute the ownership of the land or its reach and such matters of ownership are a civil matter and the LPA makes no further comment on this matter.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "The applicant is encouraged to resubmit the application with the revised and additional information or use a pre-application advice service, details of which can be found on https://www.kingston.gov.uk/applications/pre-application-advice.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety  \r\rThis planning application seeks to obtain planning permission for the conversion of the existing garage to a habitable room and the replacement of the external garage door with a window.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement, however, the removal of this feature would not be odd in the immediate vicinity of Selsdon Close, as several properties within the streetscene have already converted the garage under permitted development. Overall, this is considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its proximity in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not easily accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate replacement parking for a vehicle. However, the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted and approved.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
