    "Introduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThe Development Plan comprises:\n\nThe London Plan 2021;\nRBK Core Strategy 2012;\nKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\nThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nConsultations\n3 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \n\nComments received : \nKingston and North Kingston Conservation Areas Advisory Committee  - Objection \nWe agree that the existing rear extension of the property can be improved upon. That said, we find the stepped profile of the new enlarged rear extension e.g. when viewed from the south to be out of character with the existing  property and architectural typology of its neighbours. It would be clearly visible from the public highway and in our view conflict with the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. Furthermore, we find the proposed materials palette overly elaborate and confusing, comprising brickwork,stone, timber (+ aluminium fenestration) finishes.\n\nWe recommend that the profile of the proposed rear extension is simplified, more akin to the smoother outline of the existing extension. In addition, we recommend that the range of materials is reduced eg comprise brickwork throughout (+aluminium or timber fenestration)\n\nRBK Tree Officer -   No objection, satisfied with the proposals and the Arboricultural Submission .No objection .\n\nRBK Heritage and Conservation - Objection. Acknowledges the existing extension is already overly large and dominant and in need of improvement. The proposal exacerbates this condition by extending further back on the side which is visible to the public highway. This would step back further than the single storey extensions on the neighbouring dwellings on the street. The stepped form and range of materials are overly complicated.. The officer recommends that the proposal be rationalised with a single storey element following the footprint of the existing extension, with a taller element also following the existing arrangement, ideally with a pitched roof. London stock brick should be the primary material\n\nProposal \nThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear, first floor rear extensions. Fenestration and internal alterations.\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a detached dwelling. \n\nThe application site is within a  Liverpool Road Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building.

Granted 13.09.85\n\nPlanning Assessment  \nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- Impact upon heritage assets\n- Fire Safety \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer comment :\nThe existing rear extension presents a two storey 'contemporary' glazed extension which extends from the vernacular above ground floor level  to the lower ground floor level (basement). It is understood that the design principle and purpose of the glazed roof and rear elevation was twofold to allow light through into the host dwelling and provide visual access to the original rear elevation.\n\nThe proposal seeks to replace the existing structure with the erection of a reduced height two storey 'stepped' rear extension on the same footprint  with an additional single storey extension on the lower ground level which would provide access to the garden.  It is noted that the proposed single storey extension would  not extend the full width of the host dwelling and be positioned on the south west side. Glazing would remain a key design feature of the new  rear elevation.The proposed  roofs for each extension  element would be flat. \n\nIn respect of the north elevation and the proposed lower ground floor level, Officers note that a section of the elevation brick wall of the kitchen/ dining area would be extended out towards no.19 Queens Drive. It would have a proposed height of 1.97m and accommodate fixed glazing to provide light to the basement kitchen.  \n\nIn terms of the south side elevation, the proposed extension would present a 'stepped' built form profile  along the site boundary. It would extend  8.235m from the rear elevation of the original house. The proposed single storey extension would protrude  2.213m beyond the building line of the existing extension. The proposed height of the two storey  extension abutting the house would be 4.207m stepping down to 3.294m and then to 2.269m for the single storey element. In this location the topography is gently slopingNo new fenestration is proposed along this elevation.   Officers note the south side elevation of the proposed extension would be visible from both the public highway and from the access road which runs parallel.\n\nIn respect of the appearance of proposed rear elevation, Officers note a combination of materials are proposed for the various features. The existing external outrigger is to be  white rendered to match the appearance of the internal outrigger at lower level.  Officers would not be supportive of this visual  change as it would alter the overall appearance of the external rear elevation  of the host dwelling. However, Officers  note a new sash window is proposed for the outrigger to match the existing windows on the host dwelling. This is deemed acceptable. Officers note glazing would remain a key design feature of the new elevation to be framed by a new stone facade.  Large new aluminium sliding doors are to be introduced.\n\n Within the context of the existing built form, Officers consider that the proposed rear extension in terms of its design, form and use of materials  would not appear to be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse  and therefore not be considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective. \n\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  \nGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nHeritage Assets\nSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\n\nSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \nParagraphs 195 - 208 of the NPPF (2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\n\nOfficers  acknowledge that the proposed  replacement rear extension based on the  design, form and use of materials would not preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area resulting in less than substantial harm to the Conservation Area. In the absence of any public benefits that would outweigh this harm, the proposal is in conflict with Policy D3, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\n\nGround Level / Base Level\nUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\n\n\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",

It would have a proposed  flat roof height of  2.9m. Proposed materials  and external finishes would be masonry and render with aluminium windows.\n\nWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey  rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  \nThe principal properties to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property are nos 38 and 42 Tudor Drive. \n\nIn response to the previous  refused planning application, Officers note that the proposed single storey rear extension has been reduced in terms of its depth and would no longer present an overbearing appearance both on the shared boundary and from the garden of no 38 Tudor Drive.\n\nIn respect of no 42 Tudor Drive, it would be considered that the proposed extension would not present an overbearing impact on the basis of the close proximity of the built form to the boundary.\n\nThe current  planning application is accompanied by a Daylight, Sunlight and Overshadowing Assessment (November 2023). The Assessment has been reviewed and Officers are satisfied with the presented findings that the proposed development would not  have a significantly adverse impact  in terms of both daylight and sunlight. \n\nOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons.

    "Application Site\nThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling that currently benefits from a rear dormer loft conversion.\n\nProposal\nInstallation of solar panels on main roof and rear extension roof\n\nThis application follows recent application (23/01098/HOU dated 15.08.2023) which was refused for the following reason;\n\n1) Due to an inconsistancy with the plans it has not been possible to measure the extent of harm that may be caused by the view of the proposed solar panels above the existing ridge height contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\n\nThis reason for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful.\n\nConsultation\n6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- Fire safety. \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed Solar Panels would be visible from medium to longer range views to the north and south. They would appear incongruous, causing some harm to the character and appearance of the area. The panels would project approximately 0.7m above the flat roof ridge height when raised and approximately 0.5m when flat, which would add a distinctly industrial appearance to the dominant ridge line shared by properties along this side of the road. The solar panels at the single storey level are considered to be acceptable in isolation.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nSustainability\nThe purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development means that the planning system has an environmental objective - to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy.\n\nKingston Council has declared a Climate Emergency, and Policy DM10 encourages the incorporation of sustainable design and construction requirements. Within this context, the provision of solar panels would make a contribution, albeit limited, towards a low carbon transition.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nConclusion & Planning balance\nOfficers acknowledge positive, albeit limited, sustainability benefits of the proposal. However, it is not considered that this limited benefit would outweigh the identified harm to the character and appearance of the area.

Additionally, the proposed zinc cladding on the roof extension would not respect the exterior materials of the existing dwelling and would accentuate the bulk of the dormer which would be highly visible from neighbouring properties. The proposed dormer would not be permitted development.\n\nIt is noted that the proposed wrap-around single-storey side extension would not appear as part of the original building, due to the low-pitched zinc roof, however, it would not significantly harm the character and appearance of the streetscene. \n\nOverall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, materials and design and design.

For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Introduction\nThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \n\nBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\n \nBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\n\nThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\n\nSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\n\nThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\n\n- The London Plan 2021\n- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \n- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\n- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\n\nProposal\nThe application seeks  full planning permission for the demolition of the existing rear extension, erection of a single storey rear, front infill and first floor side extension. Fenestration alterations.\n\nConsultation\n3 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nThe proposal seeks to demolish the existing rear extension to the dwelling and erect a single storey rear, front infill and first floor side extension accompanied with fenestration alterations.\n\nThe  existing rear extension  is a conservatory and at its widest ('bay' window) has a depth of 3.58m.  It has an existing width of 5.31m.The proposed rear extension would extend a depth of 4.2m and width of 8.43m which would accommodate the further extension of the existing side extension. The proposed height of the rear extension would be 3.312m to the eaves and 3.573m to the pitch of the proposed rooflight.   Overall, Officers note that the proposed depth of the extension would be contrary to Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD and therefore would not be considered to be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the dwelling.\n\nIn addition to the above, the proposal seeks permission for a first floor side extension which would be accommodated within  the   reduced building footprint of the ground floor side extension.  This additional floor level  would result in a change of roof form of the side extension reverting from a flat roof to a hipped roof form arrangement .Overall, the addition  of both the proposed first floor extension and the hipped roof form to the existing side extension would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate  and unduly reduce  the gap between the dwelling and its neighbouring dwelling at no 47 Compton Crescent. This element of the proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\n\nThe proposal seeks approval for a front infill to the dwelling between the garage and the front door in order to create internal floorspace to accommodate a shower room.   Officers note this would be set back from the front building line of the property and this would be deemed acceptable.  \n\nIn addition, Officers note the proposal also includes the introduction of a monopitch tiled roof to front the garage, infill and the front door. This would alter the character and appearance of the front elevation of the dwelling and would be deemed acceptable.\n\nOfficers note  proposed materials would match existing.\n\nOverall, the proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at no 51 Compton Crescent.\n\nGiven the siting and depth of the proposed development  hard on the boundary with no 51, it is considered that the proposed development would result in the significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room at ground level in comparison with the existing situation. \n\nIn addition given the siting and depth of the proposed development along the shared boundary with no 51, it is considered that the proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development and present an overbearing appearance in the location.\n\nOverall, given the size of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring no. 51 Compton Crescent, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light .\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.

    "Application Site\nThe site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling within the Kingston Vale Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: An early Victorian village on the London to Portsmouth Road at the Robin Hood Gate entrance to Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common. The village is made up of an eclectic mix of mainly small-scale housing and community uses.\n\nProposal\nErection of single storey rear extension and rear dormer roof extension with 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Formation of new driveway and vehicular crossover.\n\nConsultation\n6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\n\nMalden & Coombe CAAC: No objection subject to the roof windows being conservation grade to the front elevation.\n\nRBK Highways Surgery - No objection after discussing application in the meeting. Applicant should be made aware that they are liable for any costs relating to the movement of utilities outside the property that may be required should a crossover licence be granted. However, it is noted that this is not a planning matter and more of a courtesy to the applicant.\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the proposal on heritage assets;\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \n- Fire Safety; and,\n- The impact of the development on the highway.\n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: It is noted that a number of properties within this terrace already benefit from similar loft coversions, rear extensions and dropped kerbs. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nHeritage Assets\nSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\n\nSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \nParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\n\nOfficer Comment: Due to the location of the proposal, officers consider that the proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of the Kingston Vale Conservation Area and would not cause any harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset. Since no harm has been identified it is not necessary to weigh the proposal against any public benefit.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would not exceed 3m and would be inline with the existing outrigger on the property. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nHighway Safety\nThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\n\nDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\n\nPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\n\nOfficers Comments: It is annotated on Drawing No: PT228PL01-2B that boundary treatment along the front would comprise a new 1.5m high brick wall; the proposed wall has not been shown on other drawings. On the basis of the submitted information it is likely that the proposed boundary treatment would not accord with the visibility requirements set out in the Vehicule Crossover Policy (April 2020). If erected at the suggested height the proposal could adversley impact pedestrian safety. Therefore, it is necessary to require details of front boundary treatment (which fully complies with the visibility requirements of the Vehicle Crossover Policy 2020) to be submitted prior to the erection of any front boundary treatment. Subject to this planning condition it is considered that the proposal would be acceptable from a highway safety perspective.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

In terms of  setting in from   the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm, the proposed elevations for side and rear  are compliant with the SPD. In the material consideration of the permissions granted for similar extensions at neighbouring properties as outlined in the relevant history section (which altered the hipped roof form to a gable end) are consistent with the proposed development.\n\nIt is considered that in this instance and in the context of its surroundings to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and the proposal would not have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area or the non designated heritage asset of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  \nGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nFire safety \nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\n\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\n\n--- Informatives ---\n\nPositive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\n\nGround Level / Base Level\nUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\n\n\nDetails of the Application Submission\nIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\n\nhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
    "Officer Report\n\nApplication Site\nThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Area of Archaeological Significance.\n\nProposal \nConversion of garage into habitable space, erection of a single storey garage infill and rear extension. While not explicitly stated within the description of development, from looking at the existing/proposed plans it is apparent that the garage conversion works would include alterations/replacement to the existing garage roof.\n\nConsultations\n4 properties were notified of the proposal.\n\nTwo representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\n- Inappropriate design/layout\n- Unacceptable or incompatible use\n- The proposal will encroach on the adjoining property \n- The proposal as built on the boundary may result in damage to the adjoining buildings and structures\n- Excessive height or bulk of buildings \n- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\n- Noise\n- Privacy\n- The proposal will impact the existing, shared drainage system\n\nOfficer response: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws, a separate sewer regime (Thames Water), building regulations or problems arising from the construction period which would be covered by a Party Wall Agreement are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment. Any other concerns raised with the written representations will be addressed with this report.\n\nRelevant planning history:\n23/01901/HOU for Conversion of garage into habitable space and erection of first floor side extension - Refused\n\n23/02503/PAEXT for Erection of single storey rear extension (6.0m in depth, maximum height of 3.3m and eaves height of 2.70m) - Refused\n\n23/01902/PAEXT for Erection of single storey rear extension (6.0m in depth, maximum height of 3.30m and eaves height of 2.70m) - Refused\n\n23/01859/CPU for Erection of outbuilding - Granted\n\n23/01861/CPU for Erection of hip to gable extension and rear dormer with 2no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion - Granted\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- Fire Safety\n\nCharacter and Appearance\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: The proposal is for conversion of the existing garage that abuts the common boundary into habitable room and erection of a single storey rear, infill extension of the total depth of approximately 2.1m. The proposed eaves height of the side extension would be similar to the existing one, approximately 2.8m high. The proposed rear extension element of the proposal would be of similar eaves height, however it would be finished in pitched roof of the total height of approximately 3.7m. \n\nA concern has been raised in written representations that the proposal would encroach on the adjoining property No 24. The submitted plans clearly show that the proposal would be contained within the red line boundary. It is noted that certificate A of the application form has been signed and submitted.\n\nHowever, the proposal would be set along the common boundary and no information with regards to the proposed drainage system has been provided. The submitted photographs of the dwelling show that the existing gutters are overhanging the adjoining property and this was not captured on the submitted existing plans. \n\nPolicy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD recommends that the extension should be set in from the boundary at least 250 mm so guttering does not overhang adjoining land. \n\nIn this case, as the existing garage and rear extension are situated on the boundary, the proposed siting of the rear extension may be acceptable, however the proposal must not encroach on the adjoining property. Considering submitted information, the photographs of the application site and no details of the proposed drainage system, it is unclear how drainage could be accommodated without making changes to the scheme as proposed (such as a change in roof form and height), if the drainage is not to go beyond the scope of the current application which is indicated to be contained wholly on land within the applicant's ownership. Details of drainage could not be secured by planning condition in this case as either neighbouring land would be required to accommodate drainage or material amendments would be required to the design of the extension so that drainage could be contained wholly within the application site.\n\nWith regards to the proposed mass and bulk of the proposal, it is considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposed rear extension given its modest scale and the proposed design is considered to be acceptable. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: Officers note the existing rear extension at No 28 Manor Drive North. Given the modest eaves height of the proposal, its depth and siting, it is considered that it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the nearest habitable windows at the ground floor level and it would not to appear as an overbearing when viewed from the rear garden at No 28.\n\nWith regards to No 24 Manor Drive North, due to the siting of the proposal and its scale, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy\n\nLoss of Car Parking\nParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \n\nOfficer Comment:  Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. \n\nIn relation to cycle parking, the applicant failed to demonstrate secure cycle parking provision to compensate for the loss of the garage. However Officers note that this provision may be located within the existing amenity space, details of which could be secured via condition. \n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement, which covers some of the requirements of Policy D12(A). However, a more detailed Fire Safety Statement will be required by way of a planning condition to ensure that the development achieves the highest standards of fire safety and fully addresses the requirements of Policy D12(A), as is set out within the London Plan Guidance - Fire Safety.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\nThe application site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse and is located within Claremont Road Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: Part of the original Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley. Development started in 1838, and centred around the landscaped Claremont Crescent Gardens.\n\nProposal\nRepair and retention of the existing means of enclosure.\n\nThe enclosure in question is subject to a Dangerous Structure notification by RBK Building Control Department (22/05033/ACCDS)\n\nConsultation\n10 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\n\nSurbiton CAAC - The repairs to the wall are acceptable but the loss of 2 protected trees is a concern. Alternative structural designs should be considered that permit the retention of the trees.\n\nRBK Tree Officer - Permission has already been received for removal for trees under 23/03148/TCA dated 28.11.2023. No Objection subject to condition requiring replacement trees.\n\nRBK Heritage Officer - supportive of the retention and repair of the existing wall, in a like-for-like manner. This permission is only for the localised remedial works as shown in 221293-SK-S-001, as I note the Structural Appraisal Report outlines the recommended 'short terms repairs', including a long term management plan that may conclude a full replacement of the wall in the future. No objection subject to condition requiring samples of materials\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- The impact of the development on trees.\n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: The wall will be retained and repaired. Subject to a condition regarding proposed material details, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nTrees\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\n\nWhere trees are to be lost through development the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\n\nThe Council encourages the planting of native species. Where new tree species are to be introduced, a preference will be given to native species, where these native species represent the dominant character of the landscape (e.g. in proximity to a woodland setting) or disease/pollution resistant species, where proposed in close proximity to motorised traffic.\n\nThe Council discourages the planting of invasive or aggressive species, particularly where these species are proposed to be planted in close proximity to a neighbour's wall, fence or other structure. Large-canopied species are also discouraged.\n\nOfficers Comment: It is noted that permission for removal of trees has been granted under 23/03148/TCA. The tree officer has recommended that a condition regarding replacement tree be applied should permission be granted.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
