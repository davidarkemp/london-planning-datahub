    "The proposed development, by reason of the removal of the most distinctive and characteristic shopfront features, would fail to respond positively to the scale, character, age and materials of the building as a whole. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non material amendment to planning permission ref. no  23/03364/HOU to add trickle vents to the Eden Street and Union Street windows which would not be visible from outside.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the changes are considered to be non-material.",
