    "The proposed development would provide an unsatisfactory level of amenity for future occupants of the property. There will be a poor outlook from the proposed bedrooms due to the short distance from the windows to the boundary treatment and the private amenity space would be unduly overlooked by upper floor windows of the existing property at 50 Burlington Road, to the detriment of residential amenity and the enjoyment of the property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "n the absence of an executed legal agreement to ensure that the development is car capped i.e. future occupants of the development would not be able to obtain car parking permits, the proposal would result in a significant increase in parking pressure on local streets which would cause undue highway congestion in the locality. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012), and the Sustainable Transport SPD (2013).",
    "In response to your email date 17th January 2025, the Planning Portal sets out Current Use Classes for land and buildings, which comes from legislation. You can find the Use Classes here to identify your site use: https://www.planningportal.co.uk/permission/common-projects/change-of-use/use-classes\r\rThe Lawful Development Certificate you have applied for will confirm that a proposed or existing use of land or building is lawful. You will need to specify the land uses in order for a planning decision to be made.\r\rIf you would like to progress your application then we still require the fee payment, and other information, in particular the Site Location Plan as per our previous letter.",
    "Condition 3 (Materials) of planning permission 22/02235/FUL states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of any development above ground level, samples of the facing materials to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer comment:\rWe have received the following comments from the Surbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (SCAAC) viewing the application and 'Objected' for the following reason:\r\r'There should be more effort by the architect and developers to match the materials pallette and designs traditionally used in Southborough CA.'\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge SCAAC's comments, the applicant sufficiently demonstrated that the proposed materials would be acceptable, through the submitted details which include physical samples of material. However, as mentioned in the refused application ref: 24/01778/CLC, the submitted details show changes to the design of the proposed dormers and the main roof of the dwelling (location and size of windows/rooflights). The proposed changes to the scheme cannot be achieved through a discharge of condition application. The applicant would need to formally amend the original planning permission by way of a Section 73 (minor material amendment) application or a Section 96a (non-material amendment application), depending on the scale of the proposed changes.",

The proposed changes to the scheme cannot be achieved through a discharge of condition application. The applicant would need to formally amend the original planning permission by way of a Section 73 (minor material amendment) application or a Section 96a (non-material amendment application), depending on the scale of the proposed changes.\r\r- The details of external lighting, hard landscaping materials, boundary treatments and PV panels are considered to be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rFor the reasons stated above, the submitted details for the discharge of Condition 4 (Details) would be considered unacceptable."
