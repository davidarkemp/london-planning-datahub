    "The proposed two storey side extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and create a dominant and overbearing feature that would erode the spaciousness between the neighbouring property 91 Portland Avenue and be visually intrusive in the streetscene and fail to take the opportunity to redress the imbalance in the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and further detract from the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties it would form part of and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DDM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

The approved biodiversity enhancements shall be installed prior to the beneficial occupation of any of the development hereby approved and shall be retained and maintained thereafter in perpetuity. \r\rReason: To secure biodiversity enhancements in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021).\r\rOfficers response: The submitted Enhancement Strategy Report Rev 3 dated 11th August 2023 is considered to be acceptable.
