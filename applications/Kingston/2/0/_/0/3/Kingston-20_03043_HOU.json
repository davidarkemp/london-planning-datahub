    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height and proximity to the boundary of the site, would appear overbearing when viewed from 116 Durlston Road and would deprive the occupants of this property from adequate natural light. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
