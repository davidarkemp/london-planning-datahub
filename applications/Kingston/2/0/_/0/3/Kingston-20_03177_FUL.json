    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rAlterations to existing ground floor rear extension with raising height of flat roof level. Erection of piggyback roof extension with rear juliet balcony and installation of 6nos side rooflighs. Raising roof height.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed piggyback extension resulting in a raised right height is compliant with Policy Guidance 40 of the Residential Design SPD as it has been set back from the front elevation by at lease 4m and the does not increase the height by more than 1.3m. The alterations to the roof of the single storey rear extension would not be visable within the streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regards to the piggyback roof extension, as this would not extend beyond the original rear elevation, officers have not identified any harm with regards to further loss of light. The proposed rooflight should be obscured glazing in order to mitigate light pollution and provided an element of privacy from overlooking. This would be secured by condition should permission be granted. In relation to the proposed roof height increase to the existing rear single storey extension, due to the limited height increase officers have not identified any further harm. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy however it does not address all points under policy D12(A) fully. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is not subject to heritage or tree constraints and is not located within Fluvial Flood Zones 2 or 3.\r\rProposal\r\rDemolition of an existing rear conservatory and side garage, erection of two storey side, single storey rear and front porch extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 4nos front and 1no rear rooflights.\r\rConsultation\r\r6 neighbours were notified of the proposals. In response, no comments have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The single storey rear and front extensions are considered to be acceptable. The change of roof from hip to gable is not objectionable in principle, however, it is noted that the proposals conflict with Policy Guidance (PG) 36 of the  the Residential Design SPD in that: the storey side extension is only set-down from the newly raised ridge height by only c. 0.3m (a minimum of 0.5m is required), is only set in from the site boundary by c. 0.9m (a minimum of 1m is required) and is set back from the front elevation by only c. 0.82m  (a minimum of 1m is required). The proposed dormer conflicts with PG39 and would appear to be permitted development.\r\rThe insufficient set-down from the raised roof ridge, insufficient set-in from the boundary and insufficient set-back from the front elevation results in an overly bulky form of development which detracts from the relatively open character of the area. Were No. 62 to extend in a similar way this would exacerbate the identified impacts and result in a terracing effect.\r\rFor the reasons set out above, it is considered that the proposed development would be overly bulky and incongruous within the street scene and would harm the spacious character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Having regard to neighbouring planning permissions at Nos. 58 and 62 Chiltern Drive, Officers are satisfied that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to the first floor side facing windows being conditioned as non-opening and obscure glazed.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy but it does not fully address the requirements of Policy D12(A). However, were Officers minded to grant planning permission a revised and robust Fire Safety Strategy could have been secured by planning condition.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in conflict with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\r",

    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.

Granted 31.05.2000. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 33 neighbouring properties were consulted and no representations were received. \r\rConsultees: \r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: no objection. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Principle of Development \r- Character, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Housing Mix\r- Standard of Accommodation \r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Highways and Transportation\r- Fire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development: \r\rThe Policy GG2 of the London Plan (2021) (LP) and Paragraph 125 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) (NPPF) promote the redevelopment of underutilised land for the delivery of housing. Policy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) (CS) sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the LP. LP Policy H1 sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10-year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThe Council cannot demonstrate a 5-year supply of housing land as required by the NPPF therefore, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In other words, the tilted balance weighs a development's adverse impacts against its benefits, not on a level playing field, but tilted towards granting permission. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application. \r\rThe proposal seeks to convert an existing 7-bedroom dwellinghouse into a 6-bedroom dwelling and 1-bedroom flat. There would be no loss of a family-sized dwelling in line with CS Policy DM14 and the creation of a separate flat would make a small but positive contribution to the borough's housing supply targets. This is afforded significant weight, especially in this sustainable location. Support for the principle of development is subject to compliance with Development Plan policies. \rHousing Mix:\r\rThe NPPF at para 63 directs that the size, type and tenure of housing needed for different groups in the community should be assessed and reflected in planning policies. CS Policy DM13 states new residential development is expected to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types, and provide a minimum of 30% of units as 3 or more bedroom units, unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable.\r\rThe proposal would reduce the existing house from 7-bedrooms to 6-bedrooms and create a 1-bedroom flat on the ground floor.  This is supported as the family-sized home would be retained in compliance with CS Policy DM13. \r\rOfficers note the proposed plans state the dwellinghouse would be a small (6 persons) House in Multiple Occupation (HMO) however, this has not been included in the description of development on the Application Form. Any HMO established within the property would not benefit from planning permission. It is noted any future conversion of the subject approved property to a small HMO would not benefit from permitted development rights given it would involve two Class C3 dwellinghouses to a Class C4 HMO. \r\rCharacter, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets: \r\rPara 131 of the NPPF states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rParagraphs 213 to 221 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. LP Policy HC1 and CS Policies CS8 and DM12 echo these requirements.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rCS Policy CS8 and DM10 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rNo external alterations are proposed to the existing property. The only modifications would be internal floor layout to create a separate one-bedroom flat on the ground floor. \r\rOfficers confirm there would be no adverse impacts on the character and appearance of the host property or broader LASC. This is given neutral weight in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rStandard of Accommodation: \r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rLP Policy D6 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall GIA, built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. CS Policy DM13 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rThe new flat would be 39sqm and the dwellinghouse would be reduced to 226sqm. The proposal would achieve the minimum internal space standards resulting in a functional and comfortable layout for future occupants in compliance with LP Policy D6.\r\rThe new flat would be dual aspect and each habitable room would be serviced by at least one window for suitable ventilation, outlook and access to natural light. \r\rThere would be no change in the ceiling height of the property which achieves a minimum 2.5m floor-to-ceiling height for at least 75% of the GIA, in compliance with LP Policy D6. Officers consider future occupants would be provided with a suitable level of  daylight penetration, ventilation and cooling and a sense of space. \r\rThe existing property has a 377sqm rear garden which is proposed to be split for the benefit of the new flat and dwellinghouse, in compliance with CS Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Residential Design SPD. Officers would secure details of the proposed boundary treatments separating the rear garden via condition. \r\rThe new flat would be accessible from the rear of the property via a side gate. The dwellinghouse would continue to be accessible from the front of the property. The proposal would meet at least Building Regulation M4(2) 'accessible and adaptable dwellings' in terms of step-free access, in compliance with LP Policy D7.\r\rIn summary, the proposed unit and dwellinghouse would achieve an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants in compliance with LP Policy D6 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity:\r\rNPPF para 135 sets an expectation that new development will be designed to create places that amongst other things have a 'high standard' of amenity for existing and future users. This is reflected in LP Policy D3. CS Policy DM10 is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal involves no external alterations to the property, including no new windows or openings. As such, there would be no impacts on neighbouring amenity in terms of overbearing enclosure and loss of privacy. There would also be no noticeable difference in coming and goings to the property given it would be retained for residential purposes. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of impacts on neighbouring residential amenity. \r\rHighways and Transportation: \r\rNPPF para 116 states development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network, following mitigation, would be severe. CS Policy DM10 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe existing property has parking space for 2-3 cars on the driveway. The existing car parking and access arrangement is not proposed to be altered as part of the proposal. The number of car parks exceeds the maximum standards under LP Table 10.3 (maximum of 0.75 car parks within an Outer London PTAL 4 location) however, given it is the same as the existing arrangement, the Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer considers it to be acceptable. A Unilateral Agreement has been secured to restrict residents from securing parking permits within the CPZ. \r\rThe applicant has stated that cycle storage would be provided within an existing outbuilding in the rear garden however, no details have been submitted. The cycle storage will need to accommodate a minimum of 3 cycle parking spaces for both the 1-bedroom flat and 6-bedroom property to comply with LP Policy T5. Details of the cycle storage would be secured by condition to ensure it is weatherproof, secure and accessible in line with the London Cycle Design Standards. \r\rNo details of the proposed waste storage arrangement have been provided. Bins are currently located at the front of the property adjacent to the storage. Details of the waste storage would be secured by condition to ensure they comply with the required storage capacity standards under the Residential Design Guide SPD and the storage area is secure, weatherproof and accessible in line with CS Policy CS9. \r\rOverall, Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has not objected to the proposal. The proposal would not adversely impact the local road network and would provide sufficient cycle and refuse storage facilities, subject to final details being secured by condition. This carries neutral weight in the assessment of the application. \r\rTrees and Landscaping: \r\rNPPF at para 136 states trees make an important contribution to the character and quality of urban environments, and can also help mitigate and adapt to climate change. LP Policy G7 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. CS Policy DM10 sets out that the Council expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rAn Arboricultural Method Statement, Impact Assessment and Tree Protection Plan has been submitted. No trees would be impacted by the proposed development. The report recommends tree protection fencing be installed around the perimeter of the root protection area to protect the trees from any materials or machinery that may be brought on site. The tree protection methods in the report would be secured by condition to ensure compliance. \r\rThe proposal is acceptable in terms of impacts on trees, subject to securing tree protection methods via condition. This is a neutral matter in the assessment of the scheme. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. \r\rA Fire Strategy has been submitted that demonstrates the proposal would provide suitable means of evacuation and fire safety standards, in terms of materials and fire detection measures, in accordance with LP Policy D12. The Fire Statement would be secured by condition to ensure compliance. \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. \r\rThe proposal would provide an additional flat whilst retaining the family-sized home which would make a favourable contribution to the borough's housing supply and comply with CS Policy DM13 which would carry position weight in favour of the application. The proposal exceeds the maximum residential car parking standards under LP Policy T6.1 however, given it replicates the existing situation this is afforded limited weight in the planning balance. Cycle and waste storage, tree protection and protection of neighbouring residential privacy are all neutral matters which would be managed by condition. \r\rOfficers have taken into account the Housing Delivery Test tilted presumption in favour of development as set out in para 11 of the NPPF whilst considering the conflicts with the Development Scheme. The proposed development is considered to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. Officers recommend planning permission be granted.",
    "You are reminded this planning permission does not approve the use of the property as a small Class C4 House in Multiple Occupation (HMO). If the property is to be converted to a HMO, you would need to apply for full planning permission.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Condition 89 (Ground Level Details) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\r\rPrior to any above ground works (excluding demolition) details shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority of the ground level of each plot to demonstrate adequate access for all users. The development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved details. \r\rReason: In order to provide adequate access for persons with disabilities or push chairs in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted information is considered to be sufficient. The proposed ground levels would provide adequate access for persons with disabilities or push chairs across the Plot C. \r\rAs such, the details submitted in relation to Condition  89 (Ground Level Details) for Plot C, Phase 1 only are hereby approved.\r\rThe approved details relate only to the proposed ground levels, any other information shown on the drawings would require a separate application.  \r",
