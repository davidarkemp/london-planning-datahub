    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r9 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  the erection of a single storey rear extension. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension would project a depth of  to demolish an existing garage and the erection of a single storey side extension to match the size of existing. \r\rThe existing garage projects a depth of 4.8 25m m and width of  2.6m. It has a  single mono pitch roof with an eaves height 2.27m and 2.8m height abutting the existing dwellinghouse. \r\rThe proposed single storey extension  would project a depth of 4.8m  and a width of 3.9m.   It would have a flat roof, however with the existing change of levels the  maximum eaves height closest to the original dwelling would measure 3.7m  from  existing ground floor level and the eaves height  at the new rear elevation would measure 3.9m. This would significantly exceed the height of the existing shared boundary fence between nos 95 and 93.   Both the proposed depth and eaves height of the extension would exceed the recommendations as set out in  Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD (2013). The  proposed rear elevation would present a single door and no windows. No fenestration is proposed on either flank wall of the proposed rear extension\r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rThe proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at neighbouring no 95 Cambridge Road.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would be positioned hard against the shared boundary between nos 93 and 95 Cambridge Road. \r\rOfficers have reviewed the planning records for neighbouring no 95 Cambridge Road to understand the existing internal layout of the dwelling. The existing dwelling has 3nos  fenestration arrangements on the flank wall facing towards neighbouring no 93. These include a set of french doors and a single window serving a kitchen which already  faces towards the existing flank wall of no 93  and a single window serving a WC  towards the  rear of the  outrigger. The proposed rear extension would extend beyond the rear building line of the existing outrigger at no 95 . \r\rDue to its siting, depth  and height the proposed development along the shared boundary with no 95 , it is considered that the proposed development  would constitute an unneighbourly form of development and present an overbearing appearance in this location.\r\rIn respect of neighbouring no 91 Cambridge Road, given the existing separation distance between the dwellings, it is considered that the proposed extension  would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers.\r\rOverall, given the side of the proposed development and its siting in relation to  neighbouring no 95 Cambridge Road, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of the neighbouring property  by reason of overbearing appearance. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\r",
