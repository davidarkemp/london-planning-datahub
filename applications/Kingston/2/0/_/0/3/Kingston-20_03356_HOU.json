    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Please note this application has been assessed on the plans originally submitted with the planning application - the approved drawings are listed above and form the basis of the approval. \r\rReason: For the avoidance of doubt.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a flat within the Richmond Road Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A range of fine late Victorian and Edwardian houses of distinctive groups of red brick construction. \r\rProposal\rRemoval of existing sheds. Erection of 2nos. garden outbuildings and all associated works.\r\rConsultation\r10 surrounding neighbour were notified and 4 objections have been received stating;\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Storage of hazardous substances\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- Effects on trees\r\rThis objections will be considered as part of the assessment\r\rKingston CAAC - Objection unless revised. 'The new studios as drawn are within 2m of the boundary fence and should therefore not be taller than 2.5m. The drawings as shown indicate these are 2.84m in height. For this reason they should be refused unless revised.'\r\rOfficers acknowledge the point raised by the CAAC but the proposed height restriction referenced is a limitation which applies to Lawful Development Certificates applications only. There is no such prescriptive restriction for proposals submitted as part of a planning application.\r\rRBK Tree Officer: - No objection or concerns.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on Heritage Assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the objection form Kingston CAAC, however, the application has been reviewed in line with the development plan and also Policy Guidance 41 of the Residential Design SPD. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 200 to 214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the location of the proposal to the rear, officers consider that the proposed development would not detract from the special architectural and historic interest of the Conservation Area. As is noted in the consutlations section above, the Tree Officer raises no objection to the proposed development; Officers are therefore satisfied that there would not be any unacceptable adverse impact to trees which make a positive contribution to the visual amenity of the area. Overall, Officers are satisfied that the proposals would preserve the character and appearance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area and would not cause any harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset. Since no harm has been identified it is not necessary to weigh the proposal against any public benefit.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the poisitioning of the outbuildings at the end of the garden and the seperation distance between them and all the surrounding properties, no harm has been identified. Overall,It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
