    "The proposed extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located on Malvern Road. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of first floor side and side dormers roof extension. Alteration to roof design.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne neutral representation has been received with the comments summarised as follows:\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Privacy\r- The proposed roof would overhang the adjoining property\r- The permission at No. 43 will never be implemented\r\rOfficer response: The above concerns would be addressed within the report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the previous scheme ref no 23/00043/HOU for 'erection of first floor side extension and roof extension with side gable ends' refused due to the following reason:\r\r1. The proposed development would, by virtue of its proposed height, siting and incoherent collection of roof forms, create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be of a poor design, visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 and 40 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rBased on the submitted drawings, the proposed roof extensions would result in increased roof height of the property by approximately 0.85m, which is lower than proposed increased height under the previous scheme of approximately 1m. \r\rThe proposed side dormers would be set down from the raised roof ridge by the required 0.5m as per Policy Guidance 39. The proposed flat roof form for the dormers as well as the proposed mass and bulk is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling. \r\rWith regards to the existing street scene, Officers note the recent planning permission for the adjoining property No 43 Malvern Road, however it has not been implemented and as per received written representation from the owner of this property, it would not be proceeded with. While the comments of the neighbour are noted, it is noted that planning permission runs with the land, not an individual. In any case, the proposal is assessed in relation to the adjoining properties as they stand now. \r\rThe proposed total height of the dwelling would be slightly higher than the adjoining property No 47 and significantly higher than the other adjoining property No 43. Due to the siting of the proposal, the proposed front gable and side dormer to the north elevation, would be fully visible within the existing street scene, however considering its set back from the front elevation of approximately 4.45m and its modest scale, the proposal would appear as proportionate addition and therefore would not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rOfficers note the existing street scene contains properties of various styles and roof heights and that some properties have extended at the roof level, therefore the proposal is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rOverall, due to the reduced roof height, the amended roof form for the side dormers and its set down distance from the proposed roof ridge, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and balanced addition to the host dwelling. As such it is considered that the applicant has successfully addressed the previous reason for refusal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe condition would be attached to ensure that the side windows would be obscure, glazed and non openable below 1.7m when measured from the floor level. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
