    "As a result of the proposed development, the cubic content of the roof space would exceed the cubic content of the existing roof space by more than 50 cubic metres.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a commercial unit in Surbiton District Centre. The site falls within the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area and is also adjacent to a Grade II listed building, No 12 Victoria Road and locally listed building No 9 Victoria Road. The application site concerns a locally listed building. \r\rProposal \rRemoval of fascia signage and marketing. Removal of ATM and night safe plate and infilled with stone to match existing.\r\rConsultations\r13 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee - no objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal comprises removal of all signage, ATM and night safe plate. The removed items on the front elevation will be infilled with ashlar sandstone to match the existing one.\r\rThe proposed works are considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling.\rThe proposed scale of works and its nature is considered not to have a significant impact on the existing street scene.\r\rA relevant condition would be added to ensure that the proposed ashlar sandstone would match the existing one to ensure satisfactory appearance on completion of works. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site falls within the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area.  The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as  Part of the Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley following the relocation of Surbiton Railway Station to its current site in 1838. Early houses in Victoria Road and Brighton Road were converted to commercial use by 1865, and the area now forms a substantial part of the district centre.\r\rParagraph 209 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property is locally listed and it adjoins a Grade II listed building, No 12 Victoria Road and locally listed building No 9 Victoria Road. Given the modest scale of the proposal and the materials that would match the existing ones, it is considered that it would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, therefore the proposed development would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and the adjoining listed buildings and it would preserve their significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Please provide a Existing Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
