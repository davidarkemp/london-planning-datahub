    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, height and siting, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous addition to the Kingston Vale street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would lead to less than substantial harm to the Kingston Hill Conservation Area, which would not be outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of its siting, would deprive the occupants of Nos. 2 and 3 Ullswater Close of privacy, resulting in unacceptable living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in unacceptable harm to trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant is reminded that the approval of details in relation to the planning permission does not overide the requirement for any appropriate approvals or licences which may be required by the Local Highway Authority. The applicant should to continue to engage with the Local Highway Authority in relation to the potential impact of the works on the adjoining highway.\r",
    "The site comprises a ground-floor maisonette dwelling.\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to Inappropriate design/layout, Loss of light/Sunlight & Privacy. Concerns regarding Party Wall Agreements and boundary disputes between neighbours and other disputes, such as maintenance are considered civil matters.\r\rAll other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 23/03153/FUL - Erection of single storey rear extension and change to side fenestration, demolition of two existing garages and erection of office outbuilding. Refused on 02.02.2024 for the following reason:\r\rBy reason of height, depth and siting along the shared boundary, the proposed single storey rear extension would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 35 Grove Road as it would lead to a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground floor window and cause an undue sense of enclosure, as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2023, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a depth ranging from approximately 2.4m to 4.4m from the rear wall and a parapet roof height of approximately 2.7m. Although the depth would partly fall outside the guidance of the Residential Design SPD for semi-detached dwellings, it would not be visible from the street scene and it would have a relatively modest height.\r\rThe applicant proposes to demolish two existing garages and the erection of an office outbuilding. Officers note that the outbuilding would have a large footprint, however, it would have a modest height and it would be situated in a fairly substantial rear amenity area. Additionally, the proposed outbuilding would elevate the appearance of the site as opposed to the existing garages. Therefore, officers consider that it would appear as a subordinate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application which was refused as the initially proposed rear extension would fail the BRE 45-degree rule on both plan and elevation indicating a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground-floor window that serves a bedroom at No. 35 Grove Road. Additionally, the proposed single storey rear extension would have caused an undue sense of closure to the occupiers of No.35. The amended proposals incorporate a substantial set in from the boundary shared with the adjoining ground floor flat at No. \r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the revised proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe applicant has reduced the depth of the rear extension to approximately 2.4m on the boundary shared with No. 35 Grove Road and also reduced the height from 3m to 2.7m which is no different to the existing situation of the site, as the existing conservatory also has a depth of approximately 2.4m and a height of 2.7m. \r\rOfficers acknowledge the concern raised regarding the proposed outbuilding windows, however, it is considered that the change of existing layout and use of the garden to the proposed outbuilding would not significantly change the levels of privacy within the urban context of the area.\r\rOverall, comparing the existing site layout to the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not cause any significant adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013  seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the conversion of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site. Additionally, the application form states that the site does not have any existing vehicle or cycle parking spaces, therefore the proposed development does not remove any parking spaces.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
