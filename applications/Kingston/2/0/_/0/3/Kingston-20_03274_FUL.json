    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of part hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3 nos front rooflights\r\rThe submission follows the refusal of lawful development certificate ref: 24/01967/CPU on 02.09.2024 for a similar form of development. The certificate was refused due to concerns over the submitted volume calculations.\r\rConsultation\r5x neighbouring properties have been notified: no responses have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Firstly, it is noted that the submitted drawings are inconsistent and inaccurate. For example, the submitted Side Elevations show the proposed rear dormer extending to the rearmost elevation of the existing two-storey side and rear extension. The submitted Floor Plans, Block Plan and Rear Elevation show the dormer being restricted to the roof of the original dwelling only (not extending to the very rear of the two-storey side extension).\r\rNotwithstanding the identified inaccuracies and inconsistencies, Officers consider that the proposed partial hip to gable extension would be a clumsy and discordant extension which would detract from the symmetry shared with the adjoining semi-detached dwelling. While there are examples of poor roof extensions in the vicinity, these would appear to have been carried out under permitted development or before the adoption of the Residential Design SPD (2013). Neighbouring extensions such as at No. 10 are of a considered design. The proposed rear dormer would not be set-down from the ridge of the roof as is required by the Residential Design Guidance.\r\rOverall, and notwithstanding the submission of inaccurate and conflicting drawings, Officers consider that the proposed development would be of a poor design which would detract from the character and appearance of the property and of the wider area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is not considered that the additional views from the dormer window towards neighbouring rear gardens would result in any unacceptable loss of privacy when compared to the existing situation. The A3 is situated to the rear. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring amenity.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. Officers are satisfied that the proposed development would not adversely impact the fire safety of the property subject to compliance with Building Regulations.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to conflict with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "Condition 4 (construction management plan) -  the CMP has not addressed most of the requirements necessary to discharge Condition 4. Specifically, the construction vehicle route, wheel washing arrangement, loading/unloading details, location of the materials storage area(s), welfare facility etc, including a construction site plan, amongst other requirements, have not been addressed in the CMP. The appendices referred to in the document were also missing. The CMP is expected to come as a standalone document, with the necessary appendices, unfortunately this is not the case. Based on the above comments, Highways object to the discharge of Condition 4 of planning permission 22/00561/FUL pending the submission of a well detailed standalone Construction Management Plan, with the associated appendices",
    "Condition 10 (landscaping scheme) - The landscaping plan should include the sizes 'at time of planting' for each of the proposed trees/shrubs and the species of each and every tree and plant. Officers are therfore unable to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Condition 5 (Fire Safety Strategy) - Officers have reviewed the information submitted and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "Condition 6 (waste and recycling facilities) -  Officers have reviewed the information submitted and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "Condition 7 (cycle parking facilities) - Officers have reviewed the information submitted and the cycle parking/storage details provided by the applicant are considered acceptable",
    "Condition 11 (drainage design) - The LLFA does not recommend the discharge of this condition. Full drainage calculation results are required to demonstrate that the drainage system will not flood in the 1 in 30 year event and that there will be no\rflooding of the building in the 1 in 100 year event + 40% climate change. Also, a drainage layout should be provided to show the location of all proposed SuDS and also demonstrate that the site can drain via gravity as it is currently proposed. Finally, a revised maintenance plan should be provided to include the maintenance tasks of all proposed SuDS and to confirm who shall be responsible for the maintenance of the proposed Drainage system.",
    "Condition 12 (sustainability and energy conservation) - Officers are satisfied that the development has achieved internal water usage rates of no greater than 105L per person per day and this condition can now be approved.",
    "Condition 14 (nature conservation) - Officers have reviewed the scheme to enhance the nature conservation interest of the site and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of conservatory and garage. Erection of single storey side and rear wraparound extension and two storey side extension. Erection of extension to approved dormer roof extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. One representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- The proposed demolition of a garage would result in damage to the adjoining garage and would adversely affect its appearance \r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as building regulations or problems arising from the construction are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment.\rThe other concerns will be addressed with this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Highways\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application follows the previously refused scheme ref 24/01441/HOU (Demolition of an existing garage and erection of a single storey side and rear extension) refused on 02.09.2024 due to inconsistent and inaccurate plans.\r\rOfficers note the latest application ref 24/01440/CPU (Erection of hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony. Installation of 2nos front rooflights) granted on 30.07.2024\r\rThe proposed roof over the first floor side extension would not be set down from the original roof ridge which would conflict with Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD. Due to the prominent position and characteristic separation distances, the proposed part single part two storey side extensions should have even greater set back from the font building line to retain the open character of the area and to appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the surrounding area. \r\rThe siting and scale of the proposed rear dormer roof extension would be in conflict with Policy Guidance 39, as it would not be set down and set in from the roof eaves by recommended minimum distance of 50cm. Its scale and mass would also exceed permitted development rights regarding rear dormer roof extensions, therefore it would not benefit from such a 'fallback' position as the recent application ref 24/01440/CPU. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth. However, considering its scale, the proposed design and siting and the size of the plot, it would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\r\rOverall, due to the sitting and excessive scale of the proposed rear dormer roof extension, the insufficient set back distance from the front elevation and no set down distance from the existing roof ridge of the proposed roof over the two storey side extension,  the proposal would constitute a disproportionate and bulky addition that would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.\r\rOfficers note concerns raised within the written representations regarding demolition of the garage and its impact on the appearance of the adjoining garage at No 31. Given the significant set back of the garages from the front boundary and their scale, while not ideal, it is considered that there would be no unacceptable impact on the existing street scene or the host dwellings. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed new window in the side elevation would be obscure glazed and non openable below 1.7m details of which would be secured via condition, to ensure no adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining occupiers.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting, design and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: : Despite the loss of the existing (substandard) garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least one off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r11 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey side and rear wraparound extension. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises  a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r23/03303/HOU - Erection of  single storey side extension. Granted 02.0.24\r22/03598/CPU - Erection of single storey rear detached outbuilding. Granted 02.06.23\r\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for  the erection of a single storey side and rear wraparound extension.\r\rThe dwelling benefits from an existing  planning approval for a proposed side extension to the existing dwelling  projecting a depth of 5.416m and width  of 2.633m ( planning ref 23/3303/HOU).\r\rThe proposal seeks to further extend the approved side extension  by  projecting an additional 9.88m beyond the proposed side extension providing a maximum overall depth of 15.3m resulting in the provision of a wraparound rear extension  with a projected depth of 4m  beyond the existing rear elevation of the dwelling.  The proposed side extension would be set back from the main  front entrance of the dwelling.\r\rThe existing side bay windows would be replaced by the proposed side extension and the existing  ground floor rear elevation bay replaced by the 4m depth rear extension .  The proposed rear elevation would present bi folding doors and the proposed eight flank wall would present 3nos windows.\r\rIt would have a part hipped single aspect tiled  roof  along the perimeter of the extension with an eaves height of 2.6m and maximum roof pitch  of 3.605m. The proposed walls would be pebble dash to match the existing and windows on all three elevations would be white upvc to match existing. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey  side and wraparound rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
