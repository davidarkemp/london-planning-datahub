    "he site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would extend beyond the existing two storey outrigger by approximately 2.18m, making the total depth 4.8m and have a total pitched roof height of 3m, with a eaves height of 2.4m. Although the depth would fall outside the guidance of the Residential Design SPD for terraced dwellings, it would not be visible from the streetscene, it would have a relatively modest height and the proposed material would be similar to the existing dwelling.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 19 George Road, as they benefit from an existing single-storey rear extension that would extend past the proposed extension by approximately 800mm.\r\rThe proposed development would extend past the existing conservatory at No.15 George Road by approximately 2m. The conservatory serves a kitchen which is considered a non-habitable room and officers also acknowledge the door facing No. 17 which also serves the kitchen. Therefore, no significant adverse impacts are expected concerning No. 15 George Road. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)"
