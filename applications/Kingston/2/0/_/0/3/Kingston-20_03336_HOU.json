    "The lack of detail provided on plans and supporting documents provided would result in a development that would not relate well to the host property or surrounding area, potentially causing harm to the TPO on site, and thereby resulting in less than substantial harm to Southborough Conservation Area, that would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The submitted location plan does not have road name, please revise the location plan with road names.",
