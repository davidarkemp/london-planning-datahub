    "The Proposal\rPlanning permission is sought to replace the existing astroturf pitch, on a like for like basis. The top layer of the AstroTurf has become warn over time and it is now proposed to replace the top layer. \rIn terms of works, it is proposed to: \r\r- Remove and dispose of the existing AstroTurf; \r- Repair the base underneath where required; \r- Lay a sand dressed synthetic turf\r\rConsultations and Publicity\rThe application was publicised by the posting of a site notice at the application site and an advert was placed in the local newspaper. A total of 3 owner/occupiers of neighbouring properties were directly notified by letter. No representations received\r\rStatutory consultee responses:\rMaldens and Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee: No objection.\r\rDevelopment Plan\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents: \r\rThe London Plan 2021\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022 \rThe LDF Core Strategy 2012\rThe Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008 \r\rAlso a material consideration in determining planning applications are: \r\rNational Planning Policy Framework 2024 (NPPF)\rNational Planning Practice Guidance (NPPG) \rAdopted Supplementary Planning Documents\r\r\rSite Description\rThe site relates to Rokeby School, which is an all-boys school for ages 4 to 13 located on the south side of George Road. George Road runs east to west connecting Warren Road in the east to Kingston Hill. \r\rRokeby School is identified as a Building of Townscape Merit, which is a locally listed building,   and comprises a mixture of single, two and three-storey buildings. The original  three-storey school building  has been significantly extended over the years with single and two-storey extensions.\r\rThe road is mixed use in character,  with a number of non-residential uses including three schools accessed from George Road (Marymount International School, Rokeby School and Holy Cross Preparatory School). On the opposite side of the road is Four Acres, Unilever Training Centre. The closest  residential properties are  Gatehouse Close to the south and The Drive to the west of the site.\r\rThis part of George Road is characterised by a mixture of large Victorian, Edwardian and 20th Century buildings. The buildings range in height from single to three- storeys and vary in design and appearance.\r\rThe site is within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area, a Strategic Area of Special Character, an Archaeological Area of Significance and within 100 metres of Greenspace Information for Greater London (GiGL) Habitat areas (Marymount International School and Four Acres). \r\rThe trees on the site are covered by blanket Tree Preservation Order MAC.06.56A.7 and protected by the site's conservation area designation.\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 0 (on a scale where 0 is worst and 6b best) and is not well served by public transport\r\rAssessment \rThe main planning considerations are:  \r- Sport and recreational Facilities\r- Design, Appearance and Heritage\r- Impact on Residential Amenity\r- Flood risk\r- BNG\r\rSport and Recreation Facilities \rParagraph 103 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2024 states that access to a network of high quality open spaces and opportunities for sport and physical activity is important for the health and well-being of communities, and can deliver wider benefits for nature and support efforts to address climate change.\r\rParagraph 104 of the NPPF states existing open space, sports and recreation buildings and playing fields should not be built on unless the development is for alternative sports and recreation provision, the benefits of which clearly outweigh the loss of the current or former use. \r\rLondon Plan Policy S5 (Sports and recreation facilities) states that development proposals for sports and recreation facilities should increase or enhance the provision of facilities in accessible locations, well-connected to public transport and link to networks for walking and cycling. The policy also states that development proposals should support the provision of sports lighting within reasonable hours, where there is an identified need for sports facilities, and lighting is required to increase their potential usage, unless the lighting gives rise to demonstrable harm to the local community or biodiversity.\r\rPolicy CS11 Economy and Employment notes that where appropriate, the Council will support the development of education, including schools. Paragraph 6.155 notes that the aim is to transform primary, special and secondary education but improving the school estate; enhance the range of services and activities. Policy DM23 School sets out the criteria the Council will look at when assessing the expansion of schools. Included in that list is the impact on green open space and games pitches, outdoor play and amenity space. Paragraph 6.162 goes onto state that school green space plays an important role in providing for play, sports, recreation and environmental activities for schools and provides visual amenity within the locality. It goes onto note that playing pitches are protected by the special provisions covering development on playing fields under PPG17, DCLG Circular 02/2009 the Town and Country Direction 2009 and DfES regulation with Sport England and referrals to the Secretary of State. The above planning policy would support the replacement of the existing surface on the Multi Use Games Area. \r\rLP Policy S5 states that development proposals for sports and recreation facilities should: \rincrease or enhance the provision of facilities in accessible locations, well-connected to public transport and link to networks for walking and cycling \r\rmaximise the multiple use of facilities, and encourage the co-location of services between sports providers, schools, colleges, universities and other community facilities \r\rsupport the provision of sports lighting within reasonable hours, where there is an identified need for sports facilities, and lighting is required to increase their potential usage, unless the lighting gives rise to demonstrable harm to the local community or biodiversity. \r\rLP Policy S5 also advises that where facilities are proposed on existing open space they should consider other relevant policies, such as LP Policy G2 and the borough's own assessment of needs and opportunities for sports facilities.\r\rCS Policy CS3(f) and DM5 states the Council will protect and enhance Kingston's playing fields and encourage opportunities for the extension of existing provision of sports facilities.\r\rWithin this context, the proposal would replace existing astroturf on a like for like basis, for the school's use. There is no enlargement  of the artificial surface, nor loss of  grassed surface. On this basis the proposal is considered acceptable.\r\rDesign and Heritage\rLondon Plan Policies D1 and D4 seek to ensure that new developments are well designed and appropriate to the local character of an area. New buildings and spaces should respond to the form, style and appearance to successfully integrate into the local character of an area, with a positive relationship with the natural environment and with the historic environment.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. \r                                                                                                               \rParagraphs 212 to 216 of the NPPF(2024) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rContext: The application site lies within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area, the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, and includes the locally listed building Rokeby School (Coombe Croft). It is also within a tier 2 archaeology area. \r\rThis part of George Road is characterised by a mixture of large Victorian, Edwardian and twentieth Century buildings set in spacious sylvan surroundings. The buildings range in height from single storey to three storeys and vary in design and appearance.\r\rA Heritage Assessment is submitted with the current proposal. It notes that the current MUGA has an AstroTurf surface. The new surface would be the same in terms of texture and colour (green). It would be no larger than the existing purely a like for like replacement. The MUGA is sited to the rear of the school grounds and would not be visible from the public realm. On this basis it is considered that the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, and the setting of the locally listed building.  \r\rImpact on Residential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal relates to the existing MUGA,   replacement of the surface treatment only. It would not therefore result in any material change to the use and functioning of the school sports facilities.\rOfficers conclude that the proposal would not give rise to any additional issues of noise or disturbance compared with the existing arrangements. \r\rBiodiversity Net Gain \rThe application form states that the proposal is exempt, and is subject to the de minimis exemption (development below the threshold). The development is small in scale and does not contain any relevant habitat.\rOfficers note that the de minimis exemption applies to development if the following two conditions are met:\rthe development must not impact on any onsite priority habitat;  and\rif there is an impact on other onsite habitat, that impact must be on less than 25 square metres (e.g. less than a 5m by 5m square) of onsite habitat with a biodiversity value greater than zero and on less than 5 metres of onsite linear habitat (such as a hedgerow)\rIn this context, impact is defined as: \"A development 'impacts' a habitat if it decreases the biodiversity value.\"\r\rOfficers concur that the proposal to replace astro turf on a like for like basis qualifies for the de minimis exemption. \r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rThe NPPF requires that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Paragraph 182, states that Applications which could affect drainage on or around the site should incorporate sustainable drainage systems to control flow rates and reduce volumes of runoff, and which are proportionate to the nature and scale of the proposal.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rGiven the change in surface it is considered appropiate to seek the installation of a SUDs scheme. \r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan 2021 Policy D12 (Fire Safety) states A In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \ra) for fire appliances to be positioned on \rb) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point \r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread \r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r\rFire Safety would not be impacted by this development..  \r\rConclusion and Planning Balance\r\rOverall, Officers are satisfied the proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of the local area and Coombe Wood Conservation Area and other non designated heritage assets,  and would not  result in any material impact on residential amenity. \r\r\r",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection part two storey/part single storey rear extension. Rear and side dormer roof extension in existing loft.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. Proposals to introduce forms of development where the roof form diverges from the prevailing character of residential development will be resisted unless it can be demonstrated that these proposals would make a positive contribution to the streetscape. The proposed dark grey zinc clad side dormer would be highy visable within the streetscene and would appear as incongerous. This in turn would dramatically effect the view of these property within the streetscene.  Overall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the existing depth of No. 26 at the rear, no harm has been identified with regards to loss of light from the first floor rear extension. Should permission be granted, a condition requiring the proposed window in the southern flank elevation would be applied requiring this window be obscured glazes and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed to ensure privacy and reduce overlooking.\r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
