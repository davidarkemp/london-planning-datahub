    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Cranes Park. The site is located within the Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning History\r\r22/01666/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension with balcony on top, roof extension with side dormer and installation of 1 no front roof light to facilitate loft conversion. Refuse on 15 Jul 2022\r\rReason for Refusal: \r\rThe proposed roof terrace would allow the occupiers of the application site to overlook the neighbouring property at No. 5 Cranes Park, resulting in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of this neighbouring property through a loss of privacy, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r5613 - Convert house into two S.C. flats. Application Granted on 22 Sep 1969. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 8 representations were received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds of: \r- The proposed extended roof area above the dining room will encroach on sunlight and have an overbearing appearance. \r- Proposed extension would have an overbearing appearance and will be an eyesore, and will also impede levels of daylight/sunlight.  \r- Size of the proposed extension could be considered more than a single storey. \r- Despite removal of the balcony, the proposed double doors going to roof space of single storey rear extension appears as if the space could still be used as a roof terrace. \r\rIt should be noted that amended plans were submitted for the application, and as such these neighbours were reconsulted. The eight representations received originated from only three addresses. \r\rThe points raised in relation to the impact of the development on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, and on the amenity of neighbouring properties are valid planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rIn relation to the proposed extended roof area above the dining room, the application has been amended by the applicant to remove this element. Furthermore, in the event of an approval, a condition would be attached to the permission to ensure that the roof space above the proposed single storey rear extension would not be used as a roof terrace. Otherwise the occupiers of the property would be liable to enforcement action. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance. \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets. \r- The impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of an infill dormer extension to the side/rear roofslopes. Whilst this dormer extension would not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers note that the proposed extension would not dominate the roof of the dwellinghouse. As the dormer extension is also situated to the rear of the dwelling, and would not be viewable from the streetscene, Officers consider that this element would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a flat roof single storey rear extension. This extension can be divided into two sections, one of which would extend approximately 3.5 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse and would have a maximum height of approximately 4 metres. Whilst this extension would exceed the recommended height as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, due to the scale of the extension in comparison to the original dwelling, Officers would consider that this extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse.\r\rThe second section of the proposed single storey rear extension would extend approximately 3.2 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse and would have a maximum height of approximately 3.3 metres in height to the flat roof. Similarly whilst this section of the proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the recommended height for single storey flat roof extensions as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that this extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse.\r\rAs such, whilst the proposal would not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that there would be no significant adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principle properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 5 and No. 9 Cranes Park. \r\rIn relation to No. 5, the application proposes a single storey rear extension which would measure approximately 3.2 metres in depth close to the boundary with this neighbouring property. Due to the set in of the proposed extension away from the boundary, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight or an overbearing appearance. \r\rFurthermore, Officers note that the application has been amended since the previous refusal 22/01666/HOU, to no longer include a roof terrace above the proposed single storey rear extension sited close to this neighbouring property. The amended scheme has therefore overcome the previous reason for refusal. In addition, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a loss of amenity to the neighbouring property at No. 5 Cranes Park. \r\rIn relation to No. 9 Cranes Park, the application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension close to the boundary with this neighbouring property. Whilst the proposed extension would be excessive in height, due to its set in from the boundary, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable impact on this neighbouring property through a significant loss of sunlight or an overbearing appearance. Finally, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a significant loss of privacy to No. 9 Cranes Park.   \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. As it is considered that the proposed development would result in an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, Officers consider that the proposed development would also not harm the cultural significance of the non-designated heritage asset, the Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension.\r\rRelevant planning history\r12/10119/LDP Erection of Single Storey Side/Rear Extension - granted on 15.06.2012\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site benefits from the existing single storey rear extension. The proposed full width extension would feature a dual pitched roof  with rooflights. The proposal would project approximately 3.4m beyond the existing rear building line, the infill element would be approximately 4.9m deep. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear subordinate and proportionate in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the application site address comprises mid terrace dwelling. The adjoining properties including the application site benefit from staggered rear building line and relatively small and narrow gardens. The proposed infill extension together with the existing extension, would measure approximately 7.9m in depth from the original rear building line. This would result in an overbearing appearance and would create an undue sense of enclosure to No 19 Brook Road. \r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed extension would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight in relation to habitable openings at No 19 Brook Road. \r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to 15 Brook Road. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed rear extension, by reason of its depth and siting, would be unneighbourly. It would appear overbearing when viewed from 19 Brook Road and it would result in an undue sense of enclosure, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of this adjoining property. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Section 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act directs that (1)If any person wishes to ascertain whether— \r(a)any existing use of buildings or other land is lawful; \r(b)any operations which have been carried out in, on, over or under land are lawful; or \r(c)any other matter constituting a failure to comply with any condition or limitation subject to which planning permission has been granted is lawful,he may make an application for the purpose to the local planning authority specifying the land and describing the use, operations or other matter. Section 191 further directs\r\r(2) For the purposes of this Act uses and operations are lawful at any time if— \r(a)no enforcement action may then be taken in respect of them (whether because they did not involve development or require planning permission or because the time for enforcement action has expired or for any other reason); and \r(b)they do not constitute a contravention of any of the requirements of any enforcement notice then in force.\r\rSection 25 of the Greater London Council Act 1973 is to restrict the use of residential premises in the 32 London boroughs and the City as temporary sleeping accommodation. This is achieved by making the use as temporary sleeping accommodation of the premises a material change of use for which planning permission is required. This applies even if only part of the premises is used as temporary sleeping accommodation.\r\rTemporary sleeping accommodation is defined as sleeping accommodation which is occupied by the same person for less than ninety consecutive nights and which is provided (with or without services) for a consideration arising either by way of trade for money or money's worth, or by reason of the employment of the occupant, whether or not the relationship of landlord and tenant is thereby created.\r\rUnder the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 planning permission is required for the carrying out of any development of land (subject to certain provisions). The meaning of development is set out in section 55(1) of the Act and includes a material change of use. Section 25 (of the 1973 Act) deems the change of use from residential premises to temporary sleeping accommodation as a material change of use. This brings the change from residential premises to temporary sleeping accommodation within the definition of development and means that it therefore requires planning permission.\rSection 44 of the Deregulation Acts creates a new section 25A of the 1973 Act which provides that the use as temporary sleeping accommodation of any residential premises in Greater London does not constitute a change of use (for which planning permission would be required) if certain conditions are met (the 'Exception'). \r\rThe first condition is that the sum of (a) the number of nights of use, and (b) the number of nights of any previous use of the same premises as temporary sleeping accommodation in the same calendar year, does not exceed ninety nights. \rThe second condition is that, for each night counted under (a), the person who provided the sleeping accommodation must be liable to pay council tax (which would therefore include people who are liable to council tax but are in receipt of a discount).\r\rThe applicant has not indicated that the use of the site would be for no more than 90 days. Furthermore, no evidence has been provided to indicate that the indiviudal who is to provide the sleeping accommodation would be liable to pay council tax for the site.\r\rAs such, Officers recommend that the Certificate of Lawfulness is refused.",
