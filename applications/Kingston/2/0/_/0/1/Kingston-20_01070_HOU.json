    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on King Charles Road. The site is situated within Flood Zone 2 and is on the boundary of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. \r\rPlanning History\r\r01/07128/FUL - Erection of single storey side extension and conversion of garage to study. Application Granted on 30 May 2001. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on drainage. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension, partly in place of an existing conservatory extension. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity would be No. 157 and No. 161 King Charles Road. \r\rIn relation to No. 157 King Charles Road, this neighbouring property benefits from a single storey side and rear extension. As such, whilst the proposed development would be sited close to the boundary with this neighbouring, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a loss of sunlight or an overbearing appearance to No. 157 King Charles Road. Furthermore, as no windows are proposed facing No. 157 King Charles Road, the proposal would not result in a loss of privacy to the occupiers of this neighbouring property. \r\rIn relation to No. 161 King Charles Road, this neighbouring property has not been extended to the rear. The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension on the boundary with this neighbouring property. Whilst the proposed extension may result in some loss of light to the closest habitable room windows, as this room is facilitated by a number of windows on the rear elevation, Officers consider that this loss would not be to an unacceptable level. Furthermore, as the proposed extension would be of an appropriate scale, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an overbearing appearance to this neighbouring property. Finally, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, the proposal would not result in a loss of privacy to the occupiers of No. 161 King Charles Road.   \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
