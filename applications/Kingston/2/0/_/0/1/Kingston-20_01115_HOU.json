    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the western flank elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on transportation and highways; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that it would not be adequately set in from the shared boundary or set back at first floor level the proposed extension would appear a bulky and incongruous addition to the host property. It is noted that nearby properties have been extended at the first floor level, however, these have been executed in a subordinate and sympathetic way.  The proposal would also raise the ridge height of the original roof slope and as such, the first floor side extension would not be appropriately set down from the ridge line. Given the above, officers consider that the proposal would not appear a subordinate addition to the host property, and would result in the erosion of the characteristic gaps between the detached houses within the Oakdene streetscene. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would not be adequately separated from the shared boundary and would propose a flat roof which would appear at odds with the original character of the dwelling. Given that the proposal would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers consider that it would appear an inappropriate addition to the host property, that would detract from the established character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed porch extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, however it would replace a porch of similar dimensions, and would propose an appropriate height and roof form which would appear in keeping with the character of the original dwelling.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer extension would be of a modest scale and siting and as such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original building or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the closest habitable windows of neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
