    "The proposed extension is not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as it would exceed 4m in height, contrary to A.1(f)(ii) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed rear extension has failed the BRE 45 degree rule on both plan and elevation in relation to both adjoining premises and would therefore result in a significant and unacceptable loss of daylight to both adjoining Nos. 75 and 79 Wilverley Crescent. The proposed development would therefore result in unacceptable harm to the residential amenities of adjoining premises, contrary to A.4 - (7) and (9) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a two storey semi detached building, occupied by flats and located on the north eastern corner of WIlmer Close.\r\rThe property backs onto Richmond Park, and is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rThis application relates to the ground floor flat of the property.\r\rThe proposal is for the erection of single-storey detached rear outbuilding.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r \rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rThe proposed outbuilding would comprise a flat roof structure measuring 6m (l) x 3.8m (w) and 2.5m in height. External materials would include black metal cladding to the side and rear walls, with treated timber tongue and groove on the front facade.  The roof would be rubber with a black/grey fascia and all windows UPVC. The proposed outbuilding would be of a modest scale and in proportion to the scale of the host building and garden area.\r   \rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAs stated above the application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill (SASC) which is a non-designated heritage asset. The built form of this area is characterised by predominantly 2-storey detached houses on substantial plots at low density, with mature landscaping and trees. The immediately surrounding area of the site is predominantly two storey brick buildings split into flats. Officers consider that the proposed development would not be uncharacteristic of development within the immediate vicinity of the site and that a number of outbuildings, sheds are evident in the vicinity of the property. \r\rThe development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area and officers consider that the proposed development would not result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill (SASC).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rThe proposed outbuilding is setback from any neighbouring boundaries and of an appropriate scale. Subject to its use being ancillary to the host dwelling, it is unlikely the proposal would result in any adverse impacts on neighbouring amenities.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.   \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there would appear sufficient space to include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rA basement impact assessment covering measures to reduce the risk of flooding, the basement construction method used, groundwater and surface runoff, structural stability and flooding, has been provided by a structural engineer to support the application and no potential issues from increasing the footprint and head space of the basement have been identified. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
