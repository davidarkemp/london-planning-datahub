    "Any replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased, shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\n\nAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\n\nThe applicant is advised that the following would be suitable species:\n\n(a) [Tulip Tree (Liriondendron tulipifera) x1 as replacement for Lime]\n(b) [Silver Birch (Betula pendula) x3 as replacement for Hollies]",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\n\n23 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\n\nRelevant Planning History\n22/01332/HOU - Erection of single-storey side and rear extension and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration - Refuse on 15 Jun 2022.\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; and,\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n- Fire Safety\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficers Comments: The applicant previously submitted an application that comprised a similar rear extension, however, the roof extension that was included as part of the proposal was considered visually intrusive and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The applicant has now omitted the roof extension and proposes the erection of a single storey rear extension, as such, is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\n\nWhilst the proposed rear extension would extend beyond the rear wall by a total depth of 7.6m, falling outside the guidance of 3.5m, as advised in the Residential Design SPD. It would respect the 4 metre height set out in the guidance, it would not be visible in the street scene and would appear proportionate and subordinate as similar materials are proposed. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \n\nGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
