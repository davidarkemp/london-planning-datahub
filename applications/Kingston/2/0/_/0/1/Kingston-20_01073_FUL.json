No  robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the premises has been actively marketed, and that the existing use or an alternative employment use is no longer viable. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policies DM17 and DM19 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The loss of the shop front from this prominent location on Bloomfield Road and the erection of front boundary treatment of a domestic appearance would  be highly incongruous and have a significant adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012)\r",
