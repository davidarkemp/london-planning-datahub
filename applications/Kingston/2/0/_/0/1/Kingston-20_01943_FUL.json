    "The proposed roof extension, including the hipped roof, the dormer extension and roof terrace, by reason of their scale, form, bulk, mass, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling and would visually unbalance the building of which it forms a part, resulting in an incongruous addition and unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012."
