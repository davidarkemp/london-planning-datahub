    "The provisions of prior approval is not considered to apply to the proposal as it would not exceed 3m in depth.",
    "The development must ensure that any future maintenance can be conducted solely on the applicant's land. The applicant must ensure that any construction and any subsequent maintenance can be carried out to any proposed buildings or structures\rwithout adversely affecting the safety of, or encroaching upon Network Rail's adjacent land and airspace, and therefore all/any building should be situated at least 2 metres (3m for overhead lines and third rail) from Network Rail's boundary. The reason for the 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) stand off requirement is to allow for construction and future maintenance of a building and without requirement for access to the operational railway environment which may not necessarily be granted or if granted subject to railway site safety requirements and special provisions with all associated railway costs charged to the applicant. Any less than 2m (3m for overhead lines and third rail) and there is a strong possibility that the applicant (and any future resident) will need to utilise Network Rail land and air-space to facilitate works. The applicant / resident would need to receive approval\rfor such works from the Network Rail Asset Protection Engineer, the applicant / resident would need to submit the request at least 20 weeks before any works were due to commence on site and they would be liable for all costs (e.g. all possession costs, all site safety costs, all asset protection presence costs). However, Network Rail is not required to grant permission for any third party access to its land. No structure/building should be built hard-against Network Rail's boundary as in this case there is an even higher probability of access to Network Rail land being required to undertake any construction / maintenance works. Equally any\rstructure/building erected hard against the boundary with Network Rail will impact adversely upon our maintenance teams' ability to maintain our boundary fencing and boundary treatments.",
