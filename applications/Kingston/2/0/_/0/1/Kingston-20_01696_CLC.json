The refuse bins will be stored in a convenient location and the details submitted are deemed acceptable.",
    "A sound insultation assessment has been submitted to discharge condition 8 of planning permission 21/02420/FUL.\r\rThis includes a predicted noise assessment of the use of the premises to determine the impact on the upper floor residential flats. The assessment concludes that the relevant target noise levels would be achieved (without any mitigation being required) to avoid an undue impact on these neighbours. The Council's Pollution Control Officer has reviewed the report and is satisfied to discharge this condition.",
