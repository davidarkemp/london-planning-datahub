    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling in Hawks Road. The application property is not listed, nor is it within a conservation area, and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity of the site.\r\r10x consultation letters were sent to neighbouring properties and no representations were received by the Council.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on flood risk.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal involves the erection of a single storey infill extension to the rear of the property. A double glazed and obscure glazed window would be installed in the flank wall of the original dwellinghouse at ground floor level. A small part of the extension would be partially visible from the front and its scale and appearance would be in keeping with the original property.  Therefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the streetscene or surrounding area, as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires a proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal would increase the footprint of the property, thereby reducing the amount of outdoor amenity space at the property. However, it is considered that there would be ample space remaining for residents to enjoy and undertake their day-to-day activities. \r\rThe eaves height to the side of the proposed extension would be 2.4 metres at the boundary with No.2 Kelton Villas. As a result of No.2 Kelton Villas and the host property existing alongside each other, as two separated semi-detached properties, the flank wall of the proposed side/rear extension, would have less of an impact on the side/rear of No.2 Kelton Villas. It is noted that there are windows to the rear/side of No.2 Kelton Villas within close proximity of the boundary with the  host property, However, it is considered that the proposed development would not have a significant enough adverse impact upon neighbouring amenity, to warrant refusal. The rear wall of the proposed extension would project 1.2 metres further to the rear of the existing rear wall at No.2 Clarence Villas. Therefore, the proposed extension, would cause no significant loss of daylight, loss of outlook, or increase in the sense of enclosure, to the rear/side of either No.2 Kelton Villas or No.2 Clarence Villas and would be in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe applicant has indicated that the floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate. The application is therefore acceptable in relation to flooding. In conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please conform the height of the pole and size of the equipment in the description.\rThe description needs to state the height of the overall structure including any base or antenna it is mounted on and measured from the finished ground level to the top most part. This also needs to be annotated on the drawings clearly.",
    "The submitted location plan does not have a name of the street/road. Please submit the location plan with the nearest street name.\r\rNote: Please submit a copy of an Ordnance Survey based site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red and adjoining land owned by applicant in blue, showing at least two road frontages and a North point."
