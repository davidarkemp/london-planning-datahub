    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a total depth of 5m which would be constructed on the shared boundary of neighbouring property No. 59a Leatherhead Road, falling outside the guidance lines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33. However, it would have a modest pitched roof height of 3.7m and maintain distance from neighbouring property No.1 Ellingham Road and it would not be visible in the streetscene.  Therefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would be unlikely to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

Additionally, the proposal would only be slightly visible from the streetscene and the proposed pitched roof would mimic the host dwellings' roof form. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension and the two storey side extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rules and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A).

    "Application Site\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Woodlands Avenue. The site is within the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal\rReplacing existing roof with new pitched roof with flat top, 2no rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 10no roof lights to facilitate loft conversion. First floor front extension and double-storey rear extension. New front porch and associated changes to fenestration.\r\rThis application follows recently granted permission 22/01833/HOU dated 15.08.2022 for the erection of part single, double-storey rear extension and new front porch with pediment.\r\rConsultation\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact on a non designated heritage asset;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application partly proposes the construction of a porch to the front of the property. Officers consider that the proposed porch would be in keeping and relate well to the original dwellinghouse, and would not dominate the front elevation.  With regards to the proposed changes to the roof and first floor extension to the front elevation, officers note that this would improve the appearance of the front of the property and be more in keeping with other large detached properties within the area. Rear dormers and front rooflights are also a common feature within the streetscene. Overall, The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of varying scale, design, plot styles and time periods. As it is considered that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area, Officers consider the proposed development would not harm the significance of The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed two storey rear extension would be reduced in depth overall from the previously permitted rear extensions. Any windows at first floor level or above within the side elevations should be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. this will be secure via a condition.  For this reason, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, raising concerns regarding:\r\r- Loss of Light/Sunlight \r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rReleveant Planning History\r- 22/00215/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height of 3m - Prior Approval Refused on 08 Mar 2022\r- 21/02571/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 3m and eaves height of 3m - Prior Approval Refused on 16 Sep 2021.

However, the extension would not be visible from the street and would appear subordinate to the host dwelling. Therefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed extension at 4m in depth would exceed the recommended depths within the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013), however, the extension would not project 4m beyond the rear elevation of the attached dwelling at no. 156, owing to the small rear extension to this property. The applicant has demonstrated that the proposal would not fail the \"45 Degree Rule\" in both elevation and plan form and therefore while there may be some reduction in light this is not likely to be significant. The development would not affect the amenities of No. 152. The objections are noted, however, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A).
