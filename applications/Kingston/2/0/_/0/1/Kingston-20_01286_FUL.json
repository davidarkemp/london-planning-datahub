    "Consultations\r43no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. One representation received which was neutral in its content, with comments raised in relation to the mature tree in the alleyway bordering the site, which is used throughout the year by several species of bird as a nesting habitat. Request for confirmation that the proposals would not result in damage/removal of this tree during the building process.\r\rOfficer's comments: Duly noted. The Council's Trees and Landscape Officer has reviewed the application material and raises no objection, confirming that there would be no harm to trees and minimal loss of lawn to the rear.\r\rPlanning History\rThe planning history relevant to this planning application is:\r20/03211/FUL - Demolition of existing single storey lean-to building and erection of a single storey dwelling with associated refuse facilities, cycle parking and amenity space - refused April 2021.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single-storey dwelling with associated refuse, cycle parking and amenity space, following the demolition of the existing single-storey lean-to building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\rThe principle of development;\rThe standard of accommodation provided;\rThe impact upon the residential amenity;\rThe impact upon the character and appearance of the area; \rThe impact upon highway safety;\rSustainability; \rFire Safety; and\rThe provision of Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThe proposed development seeks to redevelop the rear of the site for residential use. \r\rThe supporting material states that the existing building to the rear is used by the landowner of No.50 Burlington Road for accessional parking, not ancillary to the existing residential units on the site. The principle of creating a new residential unit within an established residential area is acceptable subject to compliance with Development Plan policies. The scheme would utilise brownfield, or previously-developed land, and so represent a sustainable form of development. Therefore, the principle of development is considered to be acceptable. \r\rStandard of Accommodation \rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                                           \rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe application seeks to provide a two bedroom unit laid over a single floor, for which Policy D6 of the London Plan would require a Gross Internal Area (GIA) of 70sqm. The proposed internal floor space amounts to 71sqm thereby providing satisfactory internal living arrangements. \r\rThe proposed dwelling is shown to have windows, French doors and bi-folding doors facing in a northerly and westerly direction out onto the courtyard amenity space. In addition, 5no. rooflights are proposed to provide further natural daylight into all rooms. A daylight and sunlight assessment was prepared and submitted for the previously refused scheme, where the results demonstrated that all three habitable rooms assessed would experience daylight (ADF) levels in full compliance with the BRE targets. Similarly, the sunlight assessment demonstrated that the living area within the dwelling would experience sunlight levels in line with the BRE guideline targets. In support of this revised scheme hereby submitted, the daylight/sunlight assessment has been updated to reflect the amendments to the scheme (i.e. increase to courtyard area, recess of wall to bedroom 1 by 1.1m and addition of skylight to bedroom 1). Similar to the original daylight/sunlight assessment, all rooms assessed will remain fully BRE compliant with respect to both daylight and sunlight. Officers find that the proposed dwelling will benefit from adequate natural light penetration. \r\rThe proposed courtyard for the two bedroom single-storey dwelling in the previous application was 16 sqm. In this revised scheme, the depth of the courtyard has increased from 4m to 8.4m (an increase of 110%) and the overall size of the courtyard has increased from 16sqm to 32sqm (an increase of 100%). When assessed against local minimum standards for new flats the proposed courtyard would far exceed guidance, however when assessed against criteria for new houses the quantum of amenity space provision would fall below guidance. Officers note that the wider area is generally characterised by different building typologies including flatted development and single family dwellinghouses with variety in the size of gardens. It is considered, in this instance, that the proposed private courtyard is of a size and configuration commensurate to the dwelling type and would provide good sized amenity space for future residents of the property. Officers also note the proximity of Blagdon public open space within 800m distance of the application site to provide additional recreation opportunities. \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers note that refusal reason (1) of the decision to the previous application (ref: 20/03211/FUL) stated that the private amenity space of the proposed dwelling would be unduly overlooked by the upper windows of the existing property at No. 50 Burlington Road. The applicant has provided photographs to demonstrate that all of the existing windows in the rear elevation of the host building are obscure glazed up to 1.7m to prevent any view down towards the new dwelling and its courtyard. Officers, therefore, find that the privacy of future residents of the proposed dwelling would not be adversely impacted in terms of loss of privacy or overlooking from these windows. \r\rThe plans show a privacy screen to the French door of bedroom 1 of the proposed dwelling to prevent overlooking from windows of No. 48. This is considered to be acceptable, particularly given the ridge of the existing rear single storey extension would also assist in intercepting views from the first floor window of No.48. The new windows on the eastern flank serving the living room and kitchen are shown as high level obscured glazed to ensure privacy is preserved between the new unit and that the amenity space at No's 52-54. Officers note that the proposed dwelling would not feature any windows to the southern elevation. Overall, officers find that the proposals would not result in any unacceptable loss of privacy and the application proposal is considered to accord with Policy DM10 and Policy Guidance 16 on privacy separation distances. \r\rIn terms of outlook, officers acknowledge that refusal reason (1) of the decision to the previous application (ref: 20/03211/FUL) also cited poor outlook from the proposed bedrooms, due to the short distance from the windows to the boundary treatment. The revised scheme has increased the distance of the bedroom windows from the boundary. The window to bedroom 1 is now shown to be set at 8.4m distance from the boundary wall, increasing the distance from 4m in the previous scheme. Proposed cross section CC illustrates that the outlook line from Bedroom 1 would not be intercepted by the existing building. Bedroom 2 is also shown to be situated over 5m from the western boundary wall, exceeding the outlook distance of 4.2m proposed in the previous scheme. \r\rIt is therefore considered that the scheme will provide an acceptable outlook from all habitable rooms. \r\rThe proposal would removes the unattractive single storey building from the shared rear site boundary with those properties in Cavendish Road to the south. The new dwelling will be single storey, same as the existing building and therefore there will be no additional impact to the outlook to those occupants at Cavendish Road. \r\rThe scale and massing of the proposed dwelling would not result in impact on outlook from the rear facing flats in the frontage building of 50 Burlington Road, nor from No's. 52-54 Burlington Road. \r\rThe proposed building remains single storey so there will not be any loss of daylight, sunlight or any harmful overshadowing resulting from the proposal. The proposal would accord with Policy DM10. \r\rImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rThe design of the new house is identical to the previous application. \r\rThe existing flat roof lean-to building is single storey and the proposed dwelling will also be single storey in height, with a part flat and part pitched roof. The front of the house nearest to the frontage building will have a flat roof which will be lower than the ridge height of the single-storey rear element of the frontage building which has a pitched roof ridge with a height of 4.25m. The rear part of the proposed dwelling will have a pitched roof, with its rear most eaves level being no higher than the existing eaves level of the existing lean-to building. The maximum ridge height would be set 1.7m lower than the adjoining building at No. 48. \r\rThe new house will be set against the rear wall of No.50, utilising the full width of the site same as the existing outbuilding. The proposed dwelling will be configured in a 'L' shape, with all habitable rooms orientated north and westwards looking out into the new courtyard. \r\rThe new dwelling will be constructed of brick. The front roof slope will have 2no. rooflights and the rear roofscape will have 3no. rooflights. The use of brick and tiles is characteristic in the area evident in the street scene.\r\rOfficers note the presence of back of site development along this part of Burlington Road. The scale and massing of the scheme is considered modest and subordinate to the surrounding buildings and the proposed development is considered to represent an appropriate scheme in its context and, as such, would accord with Policy CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 3 (good). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum car parking provision in Outer London areas with a PTAL 2-3 of up to 0.75 spaces per dwelling for 1-2 bedroom units.\r\rNo designated parking space is proposed and whilst on-street parking is available, it is within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ). As no off-street parking would be provided, the proposed development would meet the requirements in terms of maximum parking provision. A legal agreement has been executed that would prevent future occupants from applying for parking permits and therefore the proposal would not result in a significant increase in parking pressure on local streets. In this way, the second reason for refusal of the previously submitted planning application is overcome. \r\rTable 10.2 of the London Plan (2021) sets a minimum cycle parking provision of two spaces for a dwelling of this size, which is indicated on the proposed plans and could be secured by an appropriately worded condition.\r\rSustainability\rPolicy DM3 of the Council's Core Strategy states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be required to secure an energy efficiency standard of 35% of CO2 improvement over Building Regulations Part L (2013), which is secured by an appropriately worded condition. Similarly, a condition is required to secure the required level of water efficiency.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rContribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 3 with a charge of £85 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, Officers consider that there is no clear reason for refusing the proposed development in accordance with Paragraph 11 of the NPPF, 2021.  The proposed development would make a positive contribution towards the delivery of new housing and more specifically family housing in the Borough and preserve the essential characteristics of the surrounding context. Furthermore, the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable impact in terms of residential amenity and highways and transportation.  The previous reasons for refusal are considered to have been addressed. As such, it is considered that the proposed development would achieve general compliance with the NPPF, 2021, the London Plan, 2021, the Core Strategy, 2012, the Residential Design SPD, 2013 and the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED \r",
    "The site comprises terrace dwelling.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/00007/CPU - Conversion of garage into habitable space and erection of single storey rear extension. This application was Refused on 09 Mar 2022. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would adhere to the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, in regards to the overall height (3.2) and depth (3.5). The rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene and would appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. \r\rOfficers note, that the conversion of the garage into habitable space would alter the appearance for the row of terrace dwellings but would not significantly detract from the wider streetscene or the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the existing garage's small dimensions it would not be able to safely accommodate on-site car parking and would not comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. As such, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site. Furthermore, the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. Therefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey end-terrace dwellinghouse located on Amberwood Rise. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r16/14386/HOU - Erection of a single storey outbuilding (Retrospective) - Application Granted on 14 Jun 2016. With conditions.\r\r22/01018/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (4.30m in depth, maximum height of 3.20m and eaves height of 2.85m) - Prior Approval Refused on 25 Apr 2022. \r\r22/01458/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (4.30m in depth, maximum height of 3.20m and eaves height of 2.85m) - Pending Consideration. \r\rConsultations\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations were received neither OBJECTING or SUPPORTING regarding:\r- Declining swift populations. \r\rThe UK's swift population has declined by 53% between 1995 and 2016; consequently, swifts now qualify for 'endangered' status on the BTO's species list of conservation concern, indicating 'a need for urgent conservation action'.\r\rIn the event of an approval, an informative will be attached to this application notifying the application of the following:\r\rThe applicant is advised that the development might present an opportunity to help local swifts through including artificial nest sites, ie. swift bricks or boxes, into the new construction.\r\rFurthermore, again in the event of an approval, if the Officers deems it appropriate, a condition would be attached to the permission to ensure the applicant provides 3 nesting boxes for swifts prior to the beneficial occupation of the development. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of hip to gable roof extensions. Proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area.\r\rAs the application dwelling is an end terrace dwelling, with the adjoining mid terrace house having a gable roof, this element of the proposal in isolation could be acceptable. Officers also note that the application site benefits from permitted development rights, and as such the conversion of the roof from hipped to gable could potentially be carried out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. A Lawful Development Certificate would be required to demonstrate any permitted development \"fall-back\" position.\r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension. This dormer extension would primarily be constructed on the rear roofslope of the converted gable ended roof. The dormer extension would not be set in from the eaves of the roof, from the sides of the roofslope, or set down from the ridgeline of the dwellinghouse in line with the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD. Officers therefore consider that the proposed dormer extension would dominate the rear roofslope, and would not respect the existing character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rFurthermore, the application proposes to also construct a flat roof dormer extension to the roof of the existing two storey side element. This would result in a block like and bulky appearance, which would be uncharacteristic and would not relate well to the roof form of the dwellinghouse. Furthermore, this element would be viewable from Amberwood Rise, and Officers therefore consider that this element of the proposal would be an incongruous addition to the street scene.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows an outrigger. The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the outrigger, that is considered to be part of the original layout and would have width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse ,therefore the proposed extension would exceed limits set in Paragraphs A.1 (j)(iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe proposal would require planning permission.",

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Manor Drive North. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints. \r\rHowever the site backs onto an area of green space which is designated as an Area of Archaeological Significance, an area of Green Chains, as well as an area of Metropolitan Open Land. \r\rConsultations\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \rThe impact of the development of highway safety and congestion. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the conversion of the existing hipped roof to a gable ended mansard roof. Proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. Whilst the proposed conversion would result is a much larger appearing property, officers note that this form element of the proposal would not be uncharacteristic of properties on Manor Drive North, and in isolation would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a two storey side extension. This extension would not be set back from the front elevation of the property, or set down from the ridgeline of the property as recommended by the Residential Design SPD. Subsequently, Officers consider that the proposed side extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the dwellinghouse. Furthermore in conjunction with the proposed hip to gable roof conversion, Officers consider that this element of the proposal would significantly increase the scale and bulk of the dwellinghouse, appearing as a dominate addition within the streetscene. The proposed two storey side extension would therefore have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rFinally, the application proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension to the rear. Whilst the proposed extension would not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers note that the proposed development would not necessarily dominate the rear roofslope. Furthermore, Officers note the fallback position of Permitted Development rights under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B Roof Alterations of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 to construct a dormer extension of a similar design.\r\rAs such, by reason of the proposed two storey side extension, Officers consider that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would result in the loss of access to the side of the house. Officers therefore consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the application in the event of an approval for the applicant to provide details of secure onsite cycle parking. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

The proposed development would not complement the character of the existing house and wider area, contrary to recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD.
