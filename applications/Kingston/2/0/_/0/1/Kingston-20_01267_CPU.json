    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with the installation of a window to the side gable and 2no front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration\r\rConsultation\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD  2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies:\r- If the neighbouring house is set at a lower level, the depth of the extension should be reduced.\r- If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r- In all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain.\r- Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth.\r- Extensions with a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height.\r- A balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would measure approximately 3m in depth and 3.3 metres in height with a flat roof and parapet. It would therefore be complaint with policy guidance 33 of the Residentail Design SPD. Overall, The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that No. 21 and No. 25 Wolsey Drive already benefit from single storey rear extensions. Due to the limited depth and height of the proposed rear extension, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
