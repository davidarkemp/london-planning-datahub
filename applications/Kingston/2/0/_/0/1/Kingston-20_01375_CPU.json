    "The applicant has not demonstrated on balance of probabilities that the cubic content of the resulting roof space would not exceed the cubic content of the original roof space by more than 50 cubic metres. As such, the  proposed would conflict with Paragraphs B.1 (d) (ii)  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "The Site\rThe application site comprises pavement outside Nos 55-57 Tolworth Broadway, which is a busy pedestrian route.\r\rCommercial premises in the vicinity of the application site are designated shopping frontages in Tolworth District Centre. The application site is not subject to any constraints and is not situated in proximity to any designated or non designated heritage assets. \r\rPlanning History\r22/01604/FUL - Proposed installation of 1no. new BT Street Hub (following removal of associated BT kiosk) -  pending consideration \r\rConsultations\r- Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer - no objections\r- Borough Environmental Health Officer -  No objections, information regarding construction work hours will be added as an informative\r\r30 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings, and\r- The impact of the development on highways. \r\rCharacter and appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application is for display of advertisement on two 75 inch screens housed on sides of the proposed Hub. The proposed Hub would be of modern appearance, it would be made of steel for the main structure with a powder coated  aluminium exterior. Displays would be made of tempered and toughened laminated glass. \r\rThe application proposes a static method of illumination and the maximum daytime brightness level of 2500 cd/m2, with a night time maximum of 600 cd/m2. The proposed illumination levels would be appropriate in the site context.\r\rThe proposed displays would be installed to the Hub positioned outside Nos 55-57 Tolworth Broadway in a visually prominent location. \r\rIt is noted that the existing outdoor seating areas are located close to the application site. The existing street furniture is modest in scale and comprises trees, lamp and sign posts and the outdoor seating areas. As such, the proposed display screens due to its scale, mass and siting would be visually intrusive. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed display screens would have an overly dominant appearance within the street scene. The proposal would detract from the walking environment along Tolworth Broadway and would appear as clutter within the street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Given the scale, form and design of the proposal, it is considered that the proposal would not have a detrimental visual impact upon the occupants of nearby properties.\r\rHighway Safety\rIt is noted that the proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway information or directional signs. The application proposes for the maximum daytime brightness level of 2500 cd/m2, with a night time maximum of 600Cd/m2, in line with the recommendations of the Institute of Lighting Professionals, the application site would be considered an E4 Zone (Urban). For digital signs, the Institute of Lighting Professionals recommends that the levels of illuminance for signs of this size should not exceed 5000cd/m2 in daylight hours. \r\rThe Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has reviewed the application and raises no objection from a highway safety perspective.\r\rWhile the proposal's siting would be unlikely to result in problems of highway safety, it would nonetheless result in some harm through obstruction resulting in nuisance and inconvenience at times of busy usage of the footway.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Please provide a copy of block plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
