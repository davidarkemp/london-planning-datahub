    "Due to its excessive scale the proposed single storey side extension is considered to be a disproportionate addition to the original building and therefore constitutes inappropriate development in the Green Belt, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 145 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS3, DM5 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rConversion of existing garage into store and erection of single storey side and rear extension\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed works are solely for conversion of existing garage into store and erection of single storey side and rear extension. Officers note that the roof extensions are shown on all submitted plans, however the photographs of the application site doesn't show any existing roof extensions. Any roof extensions may require a separate application. \r\rThe proposed conversion of the garage into a store would involve an erection of the front extension to the existing garage which would be approximately 3m deep. The proposed design would match the existing one. Considering the sufficient set back distance from the front elevation (approximately over 8m) and modest scale and mass of the proposed extension, it is considered to appear in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. There would be no significant impact on the existing street scene as a result of the proposal. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension that would be approximately 3m deep, considering its scale and design, would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area,  in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the adjoining property  No 45 Forest Side benefits from the rear extension. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to No 45. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe.\r \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Forest Side. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the proposed store area or the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
