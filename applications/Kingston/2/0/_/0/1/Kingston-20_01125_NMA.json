    "Site\nThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Villiers Avenue. The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ).\n\nConsultations\n15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\n\nConsideration\nThe key areas of assessment are: \nThe impact of the development on character and appearance; and, \nThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\n\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. Whilst the proposed extension would exceed the 3-3.5 metre recommended maximum depth for a single storey rear extension (measuring 4 metres in depth), it would still appear proportionate and subordinate in relation to the dwellinghouse. Officers note that the proposed extension would encroach slightly on the cill height of the first floor windows. Whilst this is unfortunate, Officers consider that this would not warrant refusal alone. Overall, the proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \n\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
