    "The applicant has not demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities,  that the building as a whole, was in use or where vacant, its last known use was one falling within Class B1(a) (offices) on 29th May 2013 as required by Schedule 2, Part 3, O.1 (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r14x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation has been received, which highlights the following concerns:-\r- Excessive height and bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise, disturbance and inconvenience \r- Increasing the bulk of the building\r- Poor quality construction and the use of low grade aesthetic brick\r- A higher, larger extension overlooking the boundary\r\r\rCase Officer Response:- The host property is located in the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character. However, it is not a listed building and is not in a conservation area. The quality of on-site construction, is monitored by Kingston Building Control and a \"Materials as Specified\" Condition is recommended, if this planning application is to be approved. Building any structure according to the plans submitted and granted planning consent, is a matter for Kingston Planning to enforce. Building up to a Party Wall, is a civil matter between neighbours and a Construction Noise informative is recommended, if planning permission is granted. The remaining issues highlighted within this objection, will be addressed later in this report, in so far as they are relevant to planning.\r\rHistoric England's Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service:- we do not consider that it is necessary for this application to be notified to Historic England's Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service under their consultation criteria.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development;\rThe impact upon non-designated heritage assets; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on flood risk.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Note: The application includes the erection of a single storey rear/side and front bay window extension and the replacement of windows. The proposed rear/side and front bay window extension and the replacement of windows are designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. A pitched roof ground floor extension would be added to the side of the property and officers consider the proposed development, would have no detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the streetscene, host property, or the surrounding area.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\r\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, located in the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character. The application site is not in a conservation area, but is within an area of special local character. The host building is therefore located within a non-designated heritage asset.\rParagraph 203 of NPPF applies to non-designated heritage assets and it is stated in this paragraph that:-\r\"The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\"\rAs noted above, officers consider that the proposed development would not result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore in accordance with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers Note: The proposed rear/side and front bay window extension and the replacement of windows, would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties in either Villiers Road or Portland Road. \r\rThe applicant has indicated that the floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate. The application is therefore acceptable in relation to flooding. In conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "The submitted floor plans and roof plans do not have a North point.\r\rPlease provide existing and proposed floor plans and roof plan at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
