    "The proposed extension, by reason of its scale and siting, would be unneighbourly and would appear overbearing when viewed from 94 Warren Drive South, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for the occupants of this property. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The propsoed site is categorised as shop/showroom and the proposal is for 2 nos new flats, therefore the fee required for your planning application is £ 924.00, we acknowledge the receipt of £462.00, please pay the outstanding balance of £462.00.  Payment can be made online via the Kingston council website or our Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002"
