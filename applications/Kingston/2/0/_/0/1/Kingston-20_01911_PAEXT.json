    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rProposal\rOfficers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/02036/HOU.. The principle issue with the refused application was the siting of the proposed piggy back extension and the adverse impact on the amenities of 26 Elm Road due to reduced light entering the first floor window on the side elevation. Officers note that the proposed piggyback extension has been set back and would now be in line with the Residential Design SPD, and the applicant has also provided supporting information to demonstrate the impact of the proposal on the amenities of 26 Elm Road. As such, the changes will be discussed within the design and amenity sections below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The piggyback roof extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such, is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development, thereby addressing the previous reasons for refusal within previous application  ref: 21/02036/HOU.\r\rThe proposed rear/side first floor extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the shared boundaries, however the proposal would have a modest depth and given that the neighbouring properties currently extend further than the existing property, officers note that a greater depth would not appear out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development within the area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:Officers note that the property has received a previous refusal for a similar extension, ref: 21/02036/HOU on the basis of the proposed piggyback extension having an adverse impact on the side facing habitable window at first floor level on 28 Elm Road. Within the current proposal the applicant has demonstrated that the original dwelling would not currently pass the BRE 25-degree test or 45-degree test in relation to this habitable window and as such, the officers consider that the window in questions would not receive a significant amount of daylight. As such, there would be no material change in circumstance as a result of the proposed extension. Further, given the separation from 28 Elm Road, and that the proposed extension would have a modest increase in depth in relation to the rear habitable windows of this property, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rThe proposal would introduce openings to the side elevations at first and second floor level, therefore to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure the openings are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
