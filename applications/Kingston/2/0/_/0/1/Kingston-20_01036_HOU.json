    "The proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its excessive depth, width and height, would be a disproportionate and unneighbourly addition to the host dwelling, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and unacceptable harm to the amenities of the occupiers of 7 and 11 Buckland Road by way of overbearing appearance and loss of light. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling on Manor Close cul-de-sac.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed two-storey side/rear extension includes a tiled roof which would be consistent with the existing pitched roof element of the host dwelling, in respect of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD.  \r\rThe single side and rear extension would also generally follow the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, in regards to the proposed height(3m). Officers note that the conversion of the garage into habitable space includes alterations to fenestration and would be visible from the street scene, however, it would not significantly detract from the wider street scene or the host dwelling and it would be set back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm.\r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the existing garage's small dimensions it would not be able to safely accommodate on-site car parking and would not comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. As such, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site. Furthermore, the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. However, the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted and approved.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
