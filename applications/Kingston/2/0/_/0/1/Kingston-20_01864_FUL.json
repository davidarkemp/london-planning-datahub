    "The proposed development, by reason of its excessive mass, volume and flat roof forms would result in an incongruous form of development which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the existing building and the surrounding area. The proposed extensions would result in an unacceptable loss of existing communal amenity space for existing occupants and the proposed balcony would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy to neighbouring No.1a and No.5 Manorgate Road, contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan and Policies DM10 and CS8 of the LDF Core Strategy (adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (July 2013)",
    "\r\rThe site comprises of a detached dwelling.\r\r358 x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2x representations have been received. Neighbour objections highlight the following issues:-\r1) Overbearing extension\r2) Loss of privacy and overlooking\r3) Loss of daylight and sunlight\r4) 'Excessive' first floor extension - Loss of daylight and privacy.\r5) Windows overlooking neighbouring garden - Loss of privacy\r6) 'Excessive, excavation of rear garden with no party wall agreement put in place.\rCase Officer's Comments:-The extent of excavation associated with the proposed development is regulated by Kingston Building Control. Party Walls between properties are a civil matter between neighbours and are considered under the Party Wall Act 1996. The remaining issues highlighted, will be considered later within this report.\r\rMaldens and Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection\r\rRelevant History\r22/02050/PAEXT Erection of single storey rear extension (7.92m in depth, maximum height of 3.85m and eaves height of 2.69m) - PRIOR APPROVAL REFUSED 02.08.2022\r22/02063/CPU The conversion of an existing garage to a habitable room and a new wall and window to match the existing - GRANTED 18.08.2022\r\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers\r- The impact of the development on heritage asset\r- The impact of the development on parking and highway safety\r- Fire safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \rThe NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities.\rAt the regional level, the London Plan requires that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. It should improve an area's visual or physical connection with natural features. In areas of poor or ill-defined character, development should build on the positive elements that can contribute to establishing an enhanced character for the future function of the area.\rOfficer Comment: The proposed part single, part double storey rear extension and new front canopy, are of an acceptable size and design, when considered against the guidelines set out in the Kingston Residential Design SPD. The proposed dormer windows would be designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area. The proposed part single, part double storey rear extension and new front canopy, would be in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would not appear as incongruous additions within the streetscene and immediate surrounding area.  \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r: \rOfficer Comment The proposed rear extension at ground floor level, would extend to a maximum depth of 5.5 metres, which is further in depth than is recommended. However, the proposed rear extension, would be set away from no.53 and no.57 and would not cause an overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to these adjoining properties, significant enough to warrant refusal.\r\rIn terms of loss of daylight and direct sunlight, the rear extension proposed, would not intercept 45 degree lines drawn vertically or horizontally. As a result of the location of the proposed extension and the set away from no.53 and no.57, there would be no significant loss of direct sunlight caused to these adjoining properties. \r\rLastly, regarding increased overlooking and loss of privacy, there are existing rear facing windows at first floor level to the host property, which partly overlook the rear gardens at no.53 and no.57.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\rThe application site forms part of the Kingston Hill Conservation Area which is a designated heritage asset. The application site also falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC), which is a non-designated heritage asset.\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposed scheme would preserve the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC).\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\rThere is no access to secure cycle parking facilities being indicated with the proposal. In accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, cycle parking facilities should be shown on plans. A condition will be included with any planning permission for either proposed scheme, to include access to secure cycle parking facilities .\rThe existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate at least one space for on-site parking. The PTAL for this part of Ullswater Crescent is 1b. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1.5 spaces per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 1 to 2, for a 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal.\rThe applicant has indicated on the drawings submitted, that a lockable cycle rack will be provided with the proposal, at the front of the development.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
