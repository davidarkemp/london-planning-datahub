    "The proposed dormer extension, by reason of its scale, siting and bulk, would create an incongruous and unduly prominent feature within the Canbury Park Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed sections to show lift at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged."
