    "The proposed two storey side extension, by reason of its scale and siting, would dominate and unabalance the pair of semi-detached properties at 40-42 Manor Way, thereby resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy.",
