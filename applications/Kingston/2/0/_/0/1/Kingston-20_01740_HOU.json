    "The proposed flat roof side dormer would be incongruous and jarring when viewed within the street scene and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling, adjoining No. 44 Fairfield South or the wider area. The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the setting of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013), Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and the NPPF (2019).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed single storey side/rear extension would have a depth that is in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD. However, officers note that the proposal would have a modest height, and given that officers view similar sized extensions in the immediate vicinity, officers consider that the proposal would not appear incongruous within the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would be set in from the shared boundaries, and would have a roof form that is in keeping with the host property, which would be appropriately set down from the ridge line. As such, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that both neighbouring properties benefit from existing extensions at ground level, and that the proposed single storey rear/side extension would have a modest increase in depth past the rear elevations of the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rGiven that the proposed first floor rear extension would be set in from the shared boundaries, with a modest height, and no windows on the side elevations, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would demolish the existing rear detached garage, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. \r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking, and while the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage, officers note that the proposal would retain direct access to the rear garden, and as such it is considered that cycle storage can be accommodated on site. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "We note that your application is to amend a previous approval this site address. You must apply for these changes via one of two routes as follows:\r\r1) Householder application - Existing and Proposed plans must be submitted. The Existing plans will show the same existing situation as the previous application, and the Proposed plans must show all proposals in totality, i.e. including the new proposals. The application and proposal description would include all changes shown by the plans.\r\r2) Application to seek a Non-Material Amendment - this application will indicate the new proposals in relation to the previously approved plans, and the description will only include proposed changes to the roof in this case. A Non-Material Amendment Application Form will need to be submitted.\r\rYour currently submitted plans and application form do not specifically meet the requirements of either of the above options. Please re-submit the application form/plans via the Householder, or NMA route. Please also provide a clear proposal description.\r"
