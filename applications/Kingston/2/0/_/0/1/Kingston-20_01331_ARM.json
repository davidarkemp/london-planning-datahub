    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey detached building.\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a first floor rear extension.\r\rConsultation \r8no. properties were notified of the proposal. One representation received, objecting to the proposals on the basis of its height and massing of the roof.\r\rOfficer Comments: Noted. Please refer to main body of the report for assessment on neighbouring amenities. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- Fire Safety\r \rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rCouncil's Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for two-storey rear extensions (under Policy Guidance 34), as follows:\r-\tTwo storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling.\r-\tExtensions proposed on the boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted.\r-\tAdequate separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained.\r-\tAdequate daylighting and sunlighting of neighbouring properties should be maintained using the 45 and 25 degree principles.\r-\tOn narrow width properties - particularly terraced properties, two storey rear extensions are unlikely to be appropriate as they often result in an unreasonable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook for adjoining properties.\r-\tThe roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof and should not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof.\r-\tThe roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the 2nd floor.\r-\tFlat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building, and the use of a flat roof for a roof terrace or balcony at two-storey height will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed first floor extension would have a depth of 3.5m and span the full width of the dwelling. The extension would accommodate an extension to an existing bedroom and the addition of a further bedroom. The proposed roof form is in keeping with the host property, with fenestration and materiality to match the host dwelling. \r\rWhilst the proposal would result in the increase to the bulk and massing to the rear of No.1 Romney Road, it is considered to remain subordinate to the original dwelling and respect the character and scale of the host building.\r\rOfficers consider that it would appear an appropriate and subordinate addition to the host property, and it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed extension would broadly be in line with the single-storey rear extension at No. 3 Romney Road. It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would project beyond part of the first floor rear building line of the neighbouring property at No. 3 Romney Road. \r\rGiven the orientation positioned to the north-east of No. 3 and scale of the extension, the impact of the proposed development on neighbouring amenities is unlikely to have any material adverse impact. \r\rWhilst it is acknowledged that there would be an increase in the bulk and mass of the property at first floor level, it is considered that there would not be an unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight to habitable rooms and that the proposals would comply with BRE guidelines. Indeed, the proposals show the extension would not encroach upon the 45-degree line taken from the closest habitable window at the neighbouring property at No. 3 Romney Road, shown on plan form. \r\rOn balance, officers do not consider that the proposed extension would unduly impact on light/sunlight entering the closest window serving a habitable room to the neighbouring property at No. 3. \r\rA condition will ensure the prevention of any new windows to the side elevation of the proposed extension.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi detached dwelling located to the south west of Barton Green, New Malden.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations. \r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no responses were received. \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Design and character \r- Neighbour amenity  \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign and Character\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal is for a single storey side and rear extension to the dwelling. The proposed extension is 3m to the rear and extends 8.3m along the side of the dwelling. The extension is set back 1m from the front elevation and extends approximately 4.5m to the side of the building.\r\rThe proposed extension is set sufficiently back from the front of the building. It has a flat roof and, whilst this is not considered to relate positively to the existing building, it is accepted that the existing building has a small practically flat roof extension and that there are other examples of such extensions along Barton Green and Elm Road (notably 23 and 24 Barton Green).\r\rThe proposed extension exceeds 50% of the width of the existing building, however, in this case it is considered that there are material considerations that justify a departure from local guidance namely the irregular shape of the plot which has the majority of its space to the side of the dwelling (not the rear), as the design is stepped to reduce the visual impact and as there would still be a significant gap retained to the neighbouring No. 24 Barton Green.  On this basis, the proposal is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\r\rA minor alteration is proposed to the existing porch which is not considered to result in harm to the surrounding area.\r\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed extension extends approximately 8.2m along the neighbour boundary with 24 Barton Green but is set in from the neighbour boundary and its height of approximately 3.1m is not considered unreasonable. This neighbouring building is also set well away from the neighbour boundary. For these reasons, the proposal is not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour. The proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour. \r\rWith regard to No. 26 Barton Green, the proposed extension extends only marginally further than the existing extension to this neighbour and so it can be concluded that the proposal would not be overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour. The proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour.\rFor these reasons, the proposed extension is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rHighways and Transport\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe proposal seeks to demolish an existing garage to the rear of the property. It does not appear that this garage is accessible to cars and the property has existing forecourt parking that would be retained. \r\rAs such, the proposal is not considered to result in overspill parking to surrounding roads or an unacceptable impact to highway safety or the local highway network, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi detached dwelling located to east of Bond Road, Tolworth. \r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations. \r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no responses were received. \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Design and character \r- Neighbour amenity \r- Fire safety \r\rDesign and Character\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal is for a single storey side and rear extension to the dwelling. A rear pergola is also proposed. The extension extends between approximately 1.5m - 3.2m to the rear of the dwelling and approximately 7.8m along the side of the building. The extension has a part flat, part pitched roof ranging in height between approximately 3.2m and 4.1m. The extension comprises of brick and tile to match the existing dwelling.\r\rThe proposed extension is set in from the neighbour boundary and well back from the front elevation of the building and so it will not be prominent in the streetscene. Whilst the ridge does extend beyond the sill of the first floor level, the extension is sited so far back that it will not be read as such and is not considered to result in harm in this context. Overall, the extension is designed and scaled appropriately and, on this basis, the proposal would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed extension extends approximately 7.8m along the neighbour boundary with 20 Bond Road at a height of 3.2m.  There are flank windows to this neighbouring building but most of these appear to be secondary windows with the predominant aspect to the rear. The proposed extension is set in 1m from the boundary and the height itself is not considered unreasonable. For these reasons, the proposal is not considered overbearing for this neighbour. Officers have also undertaken a 45 degree assessment and the proposal does not interrupt the 45 degree (elevation) line to the nearest habitable window to this neighbour and so it can be concluded that the proposal will not result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight. The proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour either. \r\rWith regard to No. 24 Bond Road, the proposal only extends approximately 1.5m beyond this neighbour and so the proposal is not considered overbearing for this neighbour. Similarly, given the limited depth, the proposal would not interrupt the 45 degree line (on plan) in relation to the nearest habitable window and so it can be concluded that the proposal would result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour. The proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour.\r\rFor these reasons, the proposed extension is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

    "Consultations\r12no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, semi-detached property. The site has frontages to both Haygreen Close and Kingsnympton Park.\r\rThe surrounding properties comprises a mix of semi-detached, detached and terraced two-storey dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 77 (Single-Storey Rear Extensions) of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases the following guidance will apply:-\rDepth: \r-\tIf the neighbouring house is set at a lower level the depth of the extension should be reduced. \r-\tIf the neighbouring property has a different rear building line then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r-\tIn all cases at least 50% of the rear garden should remain. (Rear extensions to houses with very small gardens will be assessed on their individual merits.) \r-\tExtensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth.\r\rHeight:\r-\tExtensions proposed with: \r-\ta flat roof should not exceed 3m in height; \r-\ta parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height; \r-\ta pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height; and\r-\ta balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\r\rPolicy Guidance 38 (Front Extensions) of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that when designing a front extension the following guidance will apply: \r-\tFront extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. \r-\tNew porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. \r-\tPorches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation. \r-\tThe roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house. \r-\tAll front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties. \r-\tFront extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported. Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rThe proposed single-storey extension would be visible from the streetscene to the frontage of Kingsnympton Park. When viewed along Kingsnympton Park, the character of the application site where the extension is proposed is one of a front garden with low boundary treatment, similar to No's 30 and 32. The character changes to the south of the application property to one of rear garden areas bounded by timber fencing.\r\rGiven the orientation of the application property with frontages and doors to both Haygreen Close and Kingsnympton Park, the proposed extension could be considered as either a front or a rear extension. Assessed as a rear extension, the proposal would not appear sufficiently subordinate and would leave very little amenity space. Assessed as a front extension, the proposal would represent a dominant addition, much larger in scale than those of neighbouring properties to the north along Kingsnympton Park. \r\rThe proposed extension is not considered to be appropriate in its scale and would appear at odds with other modest porches to the elevations fronting Kingsnympton Park, resulting in a detrimental impact to the streetscene along Kingsnympton Park.\r \rHaving regard to the above officers, consider that there would be a material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed single-storey extension would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale and design is not considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area, particularly the streetscene to the frontage of Kingsnympton Park.\r\rThe proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.\r",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a vacant commercial premises. \r\rAssessment\r\rThe existing site is a vacant retail land and premises. The retail use is consider to be a an employment use and the proposal involves the loss of the rtail employment use. The applicant has not provided either a healthg check of the immediate locality as to whether the proposed loss of retail would result in the loss of a predominance of reatil uses in the immedaite local area or provided any marketing evidence that the retail employment use is no longer required, As such the applicant has not demonstrated the proposed development would accord with policies DM17 or DM19 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy. \r\rThe proposed development would provide a net increase of 2 dwellings and would help boost the boroughs housing stock in the absence of a 5 year housing supply. The proposed internal floorareas of the units are stated to be 107 and 106 sqm and the mix would be 1 x 3 bed and 1 x 4 bed unit. The internal floor space meets with the London Plan Policy D6 minimum unit floorrspace requirements and the mix meets the requirements of policy DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. However the applicant has not provided a section of the units to demomnstrate that the units would have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5 metres as required by London Plan Policy D6 and therefore has not demonstrated that the proposed development accords with the policy. In addition the proposal is deficient in amenity space it does not provide the minimum 50 sqm of private amenity space as required by the Council's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD and therefore does not accord with the guidance and would not accord with policy DM10 of the Council's core strategy in respect of providing an adequate provision of amenity space for future occupants.  \r\r\rIt is considered that the proposed extensions and alterations by virtue of their size, siting and design would not be of an architectural style sympathetic to or be a subordinate addition to the host property. They would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive in the streetscene and at odds with the character and appearance of the host property and that of the surrounding area. It is considered that the proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area.  As such the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of outlook, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposed development would not provide any off street parking provision and has the potential to generate increased demand for on street parking which in turn could exacerbate existing on street parking pressures and lead to congestion and in turn prejudice highway safety. It is considered therefore that in the absence of any on street parking, a signed and completed legal agreement to prevent future occupiers and visitors from applying for on street residents and vistors parking permits to mitigate parking pressures or a parking beat survey to demoinstrate sufficient existing on street parking capcity the proposed development does not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF, Policies  T6 of the The London Plan, or DM9 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. \r \rThe applicant has not provided a fire safety strategy in support of the application and as such the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development complies with policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rPlanning balance/Conclusion\rThe benefit of providing 2 additional dwellings does not outweigh the disbenifits of potential impact of the loss of retail employment floorspace the substandard accommodation (amenity space/floor to ceiling heights), the harm to the character and apperance to the host property and the surrounding area. increased on street parking pressure and fire sfatey concerns. In conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r",
    "The site comprises a ground floor flat within a semi detached dwelling located to the south of Vale Crescent, Kingston Vale, and adjoins the playing fields and open space forming part of  Wimbledon Common.\r\rThe site lies within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, which is a non designated heritage asset\r\rThe site is not subject to any other land use designations. \r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections have been received on grounds relating to:\rLoss of light\rInappropriate size and design\rNoise and disturbance\rLoss of privacy\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Design and Heritage;\r- Neighbour amenity; and  \r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign and Heritage\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design Guide SPD relates to  single storey rear extensions, which should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. It states that  extensions should not normally exceed 3-3.5m in depth, also that a pitched roof  should not normally exceed 4 m in height\r                                                                                                                \rHeritage: Paragraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment:\rThe site is located within  the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC), which is a non designated heritage asset.  Four major elements make up and contribute to the character of this SASC:-\r(1) Open spaces: This area is particularly well provided with a number of large public and private open spaces, which are semi rural in nature. It includes part of Richmond Park and three golf courses, as well as numbers of playing fields and sports grounds. Richmond Park\rand the golf courses are particularly attractive open spaces consisting of rolling grassland with many mature trees and shrubs.\r(2) Topography: An important part of the character of the SASC is that it is situated on the slopes of Kingston Hill and Coombe Hill, which enhances its visual interest and often affords panoramic views of the Borough and beyond. In addition Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill is a\rprominent landmark when viewed from many parts of the borough, especially the North of Kingston and New Malden from which it provides a pleasant wooded backcloth. Kingston Hill is also viewed to advantage from the top of Roehampton Vale in Wandsworth LB.\r(3) Buildings: The majority of houses are detached, substantially large and are generally built at much lower densities than in most other parts of the Borough. Although a majority of houses are not of particular architectural or historical interest a significant number are of townscape importance, including a considerable number of Victorian mansions, some of which are listed (many of which are located in the Kingston Hill and George Road L.A.S.C.'s)\r(4) Landscaping and gardens: Most gardens in the SASC contain substantial numbers of trees (many protected by TPOs) and shrubs which often screen buildings from public view that it is the landscape rather than the houses which is the dominant feature of the area. In addition some of the larger houses have grounds running into many acres. Another factor in enhancing the character of the area is that most of the gardens have a very clearly defined means of enclosure, whether by hedge, wall or fence.\r\rThe proposal is for the erection of a single storey conservatory style rear extension with glazed roof. The extension extends 6 metres in depth,  with a pitched roof 3.7 m in height.\r\rThe proposed extension is  considered of excessive  depth  and would  extend beyond the established rear building line of this grouping of relatively uniform properties, as such it would detract  from the host building and  the character and appearance of the area and this part of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.  The degree of harm to the non designated heritage asset is assessed as  less than substantial.\r\rConclusions on Design and Heritage\rAs such, the proposal is in conflict with Policy D3, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed extension is sited along the shared boundary with 73/75 Vale Crescent.  The extension extends approximately 6m beyond the rear elevation of the adjoining building, which also has windows in the rear projecting wing. Given the  depth and height of the extension, the proposal is considered overbearing for this ground floor  neighbour and would give  rise to an unreasonable loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to  habitable room windows within the ground floor flat at No 73 serving the living room and kitchen.\r\rWith regard to daylight and sunlight, the neighbouring building has a large rear window at the ground floor, and a kitchen window within the projecting wing, which appears to be a similar arrangement to the application site. Officers have undertaken a 45 degree test and consider  that the extension is likely to interrupt the midpoint of the (living room) window on the plan and elevation test. For this reason, it is considered that the proposal would also result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour.\r\rThe proposal would provide for additional accommodation as part of the existing flat.  Whilst objections have been received on grounds of disturbance, it is not considered that the proposed extension would result in any unreasonable level of noise or disturbance over what would be expected in a residential area.\r\rThe proposal is in conflict with the Residential Design Guide in terms of its depth. The proposed extension is considered to result in an undue loss of amenity to neighbouring residential occupiers, in conflict with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the road layout out would allow a  fire appliance  outside the site and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in conflict with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for refusal.\r",
