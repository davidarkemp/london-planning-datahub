    "The floor level for the development hereby approved shall be set 300mm above the natural ground level, in accordance with the approved plan ref. no. 03 Existing and Proposed Elevations.\r\rReason: To prevent the risk of flooding and safeguard the amenities of the future residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed change of use from existing workshop (Class B1(c)) to 4 bedrooms dwelling house (Class C3) falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class PA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order, subject to the conditions applied.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to change brickwork, introduce transoms (which will have a visual impact), reduce the number of canopies in the playground and remove a condition. In this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposed changes are considered not to be non-material.",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependant on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. \r\rThe local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.",
