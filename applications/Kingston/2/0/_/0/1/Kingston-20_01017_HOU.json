    "By virtue of their roof forms, design and appearance, the proposed two storey side extension and part single storey/part two storey rear extension would appear as unsympathetic and discordant additions that would be out of character with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore harm the visual amenity of the area contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The submitted Existing and Proposed Floor Plans (Ex-102 and PR-102) do not show the direction of North. As this is a requirement for Floor Plans, please review and amend the plans to add a North point.\r\rPlease submit any amendments to this application to the Development Management e-mail address quoted at the top of this letter, or via post, addressed to Development Management.\r\rNote: Amendments or revised drawings should not be resubmitted through the Planning Portal."
