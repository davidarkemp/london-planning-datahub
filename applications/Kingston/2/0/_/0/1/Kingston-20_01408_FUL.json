    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property and the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area.  Therefore the proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character.\r \rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for the erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension and increasing roof ridge height with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultations\r19 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposed rear dormer roof extension due to its siting and the proposed mass and bulk is contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The proposed dormer would not be set back from the roof ridge or the sides of the roof by recommend 500mm and given its size it would appear overbearing and not subordinate in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed increase in roof height is considered to be acceptable as it would appear to be  in line with the heights of the roof of the adjoining properties and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed hip to gable roof extension and installation of rooflights would relate well to the host dwelling and the surrounding area and therefore is considered to be acceptable.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character, which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would result in an adverse impact to the host property would not relate well to the host property and have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  result in harm to the significance of the Grove Lane LASC.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
