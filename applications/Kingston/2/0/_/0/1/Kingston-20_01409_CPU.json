    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion (Renewal of 17/12709/LDP) fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r20 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposed hip to gable roof extensions would alter the character of the original roof form. However, it is also noted that the original dwelling appears a somewhat standalone structure amongst the surrounding semi-detached dwellings, which some do also feature some existing hip-to-gable extensions. Therefore, while the proposal would alter the character of the original dwelling, it would be finished in materials to match the existing property, and would appear somewhat in keeping with the existing gable roof ends viewed within the immediate area.\r\rWhile the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set down from the ridge line, it would be appropriately set in from the sides and eaves of the roofslope. As such, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear a modest addition to the roofslope, and that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rOfficers note that that proposed development would introduce a window to the side elevation at roof level, and to mitigate against any loss of privacy for the occupants of neighbouring properties, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition ensuring the window is obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
