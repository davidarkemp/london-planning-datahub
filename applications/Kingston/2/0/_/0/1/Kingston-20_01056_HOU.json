    "The site comprises a detached dwelling within the Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 36 (Two Storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) states that two storey and first floor side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. The extension should remain subordinate to the original house. The proposed two storey side extension, athought set back from the front of the property, down from original roof and  in from the boundary would still appear contrived due to the proposed roof form when compared to the existing roof form. The proposed development would therefore have an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area which is considered unacceptable.  \r\r\rOfficers note that the conversion of the garage into habitable space with alterations to fenestration would slightly alter the appearance of the front elevation, however, it would not significantly detract from the wider streetscene or the host dwelling and would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of Cranes Park as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of height and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. \r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling on Avenue South.\r\r29 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Although it is noted that the proposed first-floor storey rear extension would erode the cat-slide features of the dwelling, as this feature is situated to the rear it does not contribute significantly to the character and appearance of the area.  The proposed roof form manages to capture the pitched roof aspect of the host dwelling, ensuring that the proposal would appear proportionate and subordinate.\r\rWhilst the two-storey side extension would be visible from the street, the proposal would generally comply with the guidance provided in Policy Guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD and would be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area.\r\rAlthough porch extensions of depth are not a common addition on Avenue South, the proposed porch would reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. It would also be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and would not dominate the front elevation, in compliance with Policy Guidance 38 of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.

Officers consider that the omission of the garage and the front extension would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. However, the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted and approved.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that the Planning Condition 1 (Land Contamination) of granted prior approval 18/12700/PNSR, is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 1 (Details of Brickwork) of panning permission 22/00511/NMA (Non-Material Amendment to Planning Permission ref: 21/01897/HOU is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site comprises three storeys of office accommodation with car parking located on the ground floor level on Beverley Way, adjacent to the A208 Coombe Lane Flyover to the north and the A3 Kingston By-Pass to the west. The site does not contain a Listed Building and is not located within a Conservation Area, although it is noted that Grade II listed Coombe Hill Stables is situated approximately 280m to the north-west of the application site along with Coombe Hill Conservation Area. Beverley Court to the south is a three storey residential building with a mansard type roof. With the exception of Beverley Court and Coombe Hill House, development in the area is largely two-storeys in height\r\rA prior notification under Schedule 2, Part 20, Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 was submitted (21/01032/PACND) for the erection of an additional 2 storeys to existing B1 Office to create 45 self-contained flats (19 no. two bedroom, 21 no. one-bedroom and 5 no. studios) with associated works and installation of Juliet balconies and this was subsequently granted at appeal (APP/Z5630/W/21/3277999 dated 04.03.2022). The Class AA prior approval only considered the erection of an additional 2 storeys with balconies to the existing B1 Office and did not permit operational development to the rest of the existing building.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of prior approval ref: 21/01032/PACND in order to remove the curtain wall glazing and replace with traditional brickwork and windows along East and North elevations.\r\rConsultation\r100 surrounding neighbours have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Effects on trees\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Fumes\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosur\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Storage of hazardous substances\r- Support\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rit is noted that these objections refer to the overall development and not the amendments this application relates to.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The ability to vary planning conditions on a prior approval \r\rOfficer Comment: It is accepted that a Section 73 planning application can be used to vary planning conditions on a prior approval. However, it cannot grant planning permission for new operational development when the prior approval only concerned the change of use and specified amendments.\r\rThe proposed removal of the curtain wall glazing and replacement with traditional brickwork and windows would constitute development which would require planning permission. Class AA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) did not allow for operational development to the rest of the existing building. The proposed external alterations/additions to the building would therfore require full planning permission. \r\rConclusion\rIt is considered that the proposals go beyond the scope of a Section 73 minor-material amendment planning application as the prior approval which the applicant is seeking to vary concerned a change of use and additional storeys and not operational development to the rest of the existing building. The proposals would go beyond the prior approval consent and the description of development. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.",
