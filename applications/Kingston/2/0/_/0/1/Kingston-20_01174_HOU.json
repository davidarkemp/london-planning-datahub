    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r\r",
    "The development hereby approved  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the referenced windows shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. The referenced windows are as follows: \ra) Any windows, dormer windows and roof lights fitted in the side (east) elevation at first floor level and above\rb) The windows of any rooms labelled as 'bathroom' on the approved drawings\r\rAny film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. Reason: To safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The outbuilding hereby approved shall be used for purposes ancillary to the main dwelling house, and shall not be used, sold or sub-let as a separate self-contained unit.\r\rReason: A separate unit of accommodation of this nature is not acceptable in this location in the interests of the amenities, character of the area and highway safety in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a large detached dwellinghouse located on Warren Park. The site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, as well as the Kingston Hill Area of Archaeological Significance. The site contains trees that are subject to Tree Preservation Orders.\r\rPlanning History\r\r20/02006/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension, enlargement of the switch room and conversion of garage into habitable room. Increase in roof height and installation of\rdormer windows to front and rear roofslopes. Alterations to fenestration. Application Granted on 02 Nov 2020. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rHistoric England (Archaeology) - No comments. \r\rPollution Control - No objections, subject to construction hours condition. \r\rTree and Landscape Officer - A detailed Arboricultural Method Statement & Tree Protection Plan, including details of foundations prior to determination must be submitted.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on trees.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a contemporary style extension to the side and rear of the dwellinghouse, to facilitate an extension to a pool area. It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. However, given the size of the site and the host dwelling, and that the proposed extension would infill an existing void to the rear of the dwellinghouse, it is that the proposed single storey side/rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling.\r\rOfficers note the choice of material as white wall stone cladding is not ideal, as it is not of a similar appearance to the dwellinghouse, and arguably does not complement the existing design. However, as this extension would be largely situated to the rear, and largely not viewable from the public realm this would not warrant refusal. \r\rThe application also proposes the installation of a rooflight above the existing pool area. This is an appropriate form of development for a residential dwellinghouse, which would not adversely impact the character of the dwelling. \r\rAs such Officers consider that there would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill SASC constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough. Officers consider that the proposed construction single storey extension would not detract from the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse or surrounding area The proposed development therefore would not result in any harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficers Comments: The applicant failed to provide a detailed Arboricultural Method Statement & Tree Protection Plan, including details of foundations to ensure that the proposed development can be achieved without causing harm to protected trees. As such the proposal is contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council/s Core Strategy.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
