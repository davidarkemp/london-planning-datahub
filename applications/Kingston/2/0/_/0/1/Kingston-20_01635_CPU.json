    "The proposed roof replacement together with any existing enlargement would extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 4 metres and would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. Therefore the proposed roof replacement is not considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (f), (j)(iii), (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "It has not been demonstrated on the balance of probabilities, that the proposed roof replacement, together with all existing enlargement would not exceed 50% of the total area of the curtilage (excluding the ground area of the original dwellinghouse) and therefore  would fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is located on the northern side of the Griffin Centre which is immediately west of Market Place in the designated Kingston Town Centre.\r\rThe surrounding area is an area of mixed use. The site is located within the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the unit has a statutory listing (Grade II) as part of the group of buildings that form the Griffin Centre.\r\rThe Historic England Listing description is set out below:\r\"Chiesman's Store (formerly Hide's Store). A large modern department store, most of which is not of interest, but it contains some items of importance. In the basement, some flint walling and C17 brickwork. Inside the store, a fine mid C17 timber staircase from the Castle Hotel, which formerly occupied the site. Heavy square newels with carved, panelled sides and ball finials; strings carved with laurel leaves; heavy, moulded handrails; the space between handrails and strings filled with heavy foliage and roses, within which are some human figures. Some of the newels are initialled. [VCH]. Also incorporated into the new structure is a C18 hipped, tiled roof above a much-altered 3 storey, 4 bay range. [On the south side facing alleyway to back yard]. Listed solely for the items described.\"\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for minor alterations to shopfront and display of advert. \rAn accompanying Listed Building Consent application and Advertisement Consent application have been submitted for the same proposals under reference: 22/02718/LBC and 22/02670/ADV.\r\rConsultations\r23no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the application.  No responses were received.   \rKingston Town Centre Conservation Area Advisory Committee: No objection.\rHistoric England: No view expressed on the proposal. Authorise delegated determination.\rHistoric England (Archaeology): No comment.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issue to assess in the consideration of this application is the impact that the development would have on the character of the area and the streetscene and impact upon heritage assets. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rParagraph 125 of the NPPF 2021 states that the creation of high quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study 2011 and the Residential Design SPD 2013, ensuring that new development:\r-\tRecognises distinctive local features and character;\r-\tHas regard to the historic and natural environment;\r-\tHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality;\r-\tAccords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"; and,\r-\tRelates well and connects to its surroundings.\r\rPolicy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r-\tPrevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy;\r-\tPrevailing density of the surrounding area;\r-\tScale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing;\r-\tLandscape setting and features;\r-\tPlot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings;\r-\tBuilding line build-up, set-back and front boundary; and,\r-\tTypical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe proposed works consist of minor decorative alterations to the shop-front and the installation of new advertising signage.\r(The signage is covered / assessed under a separate application - 22/02670ADV)\r\rThe application covers the repair and redecoration of the pilasters, windows and external doors proposed to be finished in pale blue colour. The application also proposes the repair and redecoration of the stall riser and fascia in pale blue with white infill. Two LED light troughs above the fascia signage to the elevation fronting Market Place are proposed. \r\rOverall, the design and materials are considered to be visually unobtrusive and are considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene, thereby complying with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposals are considered to be sympathetic to the scale, mass, height and aesthetic attributes of the designated heritage asset of the Grade-II listed building. The level of intervention on the fabric of the Grade II building itself is minimal, thereby preserving the character defining elements of the historic fabric, retaining the authenticity of the building. The impact of the proposals is considered to result in \"less than substantial harm\" to the heritage asset. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposed replacement shopfront is considered to be of a design that preserves the character and appearance of the street scene and would result in 'less than substantial' harm to the significance of the designated heritage assets. This limited degree of harm has been assessed as being outweighed by the public benefits associated with the proposals, namely the ability to operate a viable commercial business from the premises as a hospitality/catering venue for public use. As such, the proposal is considered to comply with policies D3 and H1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Canbury Avenue. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single-storey side extension (retrospective application)\r\rRelevant Planning History\r19/02920/HOU - Erection of part single, part two storey rear extension and a single storey side extension incorporating a porch granted on 25/02/2020\r\rConsultations\r9 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The single storey side extension element of the development approved under planning permission ref no 19/02920/HOU  has not been built in accordance with the approved drawings.\r\rThe proposed side extension as built measures approximately 7.2m in depth, 2.3m in eaves height and has a total height of approximately 3m and is set back approximately 2.5m from the front elevation.\r\rThe approved side extension measured approximately 6.7m in depth, 2m in eaves height and had a total height of 2.6m. \r\rDespite the increase in measurements, the side extension as built is considered to fall within Policy Guidance 35 in terms of its height and set back distance. It is noted that the extension would abut the common boundary with No 103 Canbury Avenue (as per original planning permission), however considering the existing street scene comprising similar developments, it is acceptable. \r\rThe proposed roof form and materials would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development (as built) is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rThe development would prevent easy access to the rear garden and therefore easy access to safe and secure cycle parking, as such a condition has been imposed to secure details of safe cycle parking. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "The submitted Proposed Block Plan (4.8m) is labelled as location plan and is in 1:1250 scale. Please amend the block plan with a correct labelling and scale.\rPlease provide a Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
