    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r\rOne neighbour objection received and summarised as follows\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rOfficer comment; assessment addresses matters raised in objection \r\rKCAAC Objection receievd and summarised as follows \r\r- Scale \r- Materials \r- Harm to Conservation Area\r\rOfficer comment: assessment addresses the matters raised in objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle of development\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rPrinciple of the development\r\rThe proposal seeks to provide a replacement outbuilding for continued ancillary use to the primary use of the plot a residential dwelling and the application does not seek to change the use of the site or relationship between outbuilding and dwellinghouse. It is considered that the principle of the development is acceptable.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on designated and non designated heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rThe application sits within the designated heritage asset the Riverside South Conservation Area and adjacent the non designated heritage asset the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character. \r\rAn outbuidling to the rear of the host property currently exists and fronts the highway to The Mall. The outbuilding has a subserviant relationship both to the host property and the streetscene to which it fronts and sits comfortably within, and does not compete with its surroundings. \r\rThe proposed development would be of a much larger scale and would become a dominant feature on both the plot of the host property and within the streetscene. It would be highly visible in both the public and private views of the site with a larger footporint, steep pitch and high ridge height and overall mass and bulk. It would not sit comfortably on the plot or its surroundings and instead would copmpete with the host property and its surroundings the development would create a dominant and visually intrusive addition to the plot and the surrounding area.  The external finshes are considered to be out of keeping with their surroundings and would further highlight the buildings presence and dominance.\r\rIt is considered that the proposal would neither enhance or preserve the conservation area or the adjacent local area of special character and would cause less than substantial harm to the heritage assets. \r \rIt is therefore considered that the proposed outbuilding by virtue of its size, siting, design and appearnce would be an incongruous addition to the host property and streetscene that would be a dominant and overbearing visually intrusive featiure and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and cause less than substantial harm to the surrounding designated heritage asset Riverside South Conservation Area it sits within and the adjacent non-designated heritage asset the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character. The proposal therefore would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Lisated Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paras 189 to 203 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the orientation of the proposed development and the spearartion distances between the neighbouring properties and habitable room windows and neighbouring gardens to the porposed development are such that the the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. It is consisdered that ther\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
