    "The proposed change of use of the first floor of 69 Kingston Road from B1(a) Offices to C3 (Residential) falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r",
    "The development hereby permitted must be completed within a period of 3 years starting with the prior approval date\r\rReason: To ensure compliance with condition O.2 (2) of Class O, Part 3, Schedule 2 of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on The Manor Drive. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and \r- Fire Safety\r\r\rDesign \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comments:The proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed front porch roof  would cut across the existing window, the proposal domiantes the front elevation and would not reflect the surrounding character and appearance of the surrounding area .  Porches  should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not\rdominate the front elevation as outlined by the Residential Design SPD\r\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are Nos. 57 & 61  Manor Drive North.  The proposed rear extension would be small in scale, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.  Officers note that it would accord with BRE guidelines and pass the 45 Degree Rule..\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of first floor rear/side extension\r\rConsultation\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified and two objections from one address have been received stating;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\rThese concerns will be considered as part of the assessment.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to the proposed first floor side extension, Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD states that the extension should remain subordinate to the original house, be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps, The roof line should be set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm; and, The front elevation should be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the existing hip to gable extension has already caused harm to the symmetry of the pair of semi detached dwelling. it is noted that the proposed first floor extension has been set down from the roof, Set in from the boundary and back in from the front elevation in compliance with policy guidance 36. It is acknowledged the proposed roof form differs from that of the main house, however, given the variety of styles in the area officers feel this would on balance be acceptable. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would not have an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:   With regards to neighbouring amenity, the principal properties to be considered are No. 64 and No. 68 Cedarcroft Road. In relation to No. 68 Cedarcroft Road, it is noted that the proposed first floor extension has been positioned away from the adjoining boundary in order to mitigate loss of light to the nearest first floor habitable window. Due to the minimal depth of the first floor extension at approximately 2.6m, it is considered that the proposed first floor extension would not be overbearing or lead to loss of light to No. 68 Cedarcroft Road. In relation to No.64 Cedarcroft Road, due to the separation distance between No. 66 and No. 64 Cedarcroft Road, it is considered that whilst there maybe some overshadowing, the proposed first floor extension would not be overbearing or lead to material loss of light. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rand,\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The description of the application will be confirmed after receiving the proposed ground floor plan.",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
