    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate, on the balance of probabilities, that the siting of the proposed shepherd hut for use as additional accommodation would not constitute building operations or other operations as defined within s55 1(A) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated that the shepherd hut would fall within the provisions of permitted development as granted under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) 2015.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey semi-detached dwelling. \r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of single storey infill to rear on both side with conservatory, infill to side between existing garage and front wall extension.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal and no representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed conservatory extension to the rear would be in accordance with the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, scale and design, aligning with the extension of the neighbouring property.\r\rTo the front of the property, the single storey side extension would have a small setback from the front elevation, with a roof and window design that relate well to the host dwelling, appearing as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the property. The extension to the rear of the side extension is modest in size and continues the existing building line to the side. No objection is raised to the proposed garden door.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties to consider are Nos.54 and 58 Grange Road. \r\rTo No.54 the proposed development would maintain the existing setback and the single storey extension modest in size or scale. The proposed conservatory would align with the rear extension of the neighbouring property at No.58 Grange Road.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rHighways and Transport\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it would not constitute a loss of off-street car parking provision on site as it would not conform with the space standards set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013 and could not accommodate a modern vehicle. The hardstanding to the front of the property would remain unchanged and continue to provide off-street car parking for 1 vehicle which would accord with the maximum standards set out in the London Plan. External access to the rear of the property is maintained for cycle parking. \r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission to convert a garage into habitable space to facilitate an en-suite shower room.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the existing car parking facilities; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed change of use of the existing garage into habitable space would include installation of a new window to the front elevation. It is noted that the proposed materials would match the existing. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its  would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways and Transportation \rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rDespite the loss of the garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least 2 off-street car parking spaces. It is noted that the existing garage due to its size cannot be used for car parking purposes. It is however noted that the conversion would prevent easy access to parking provision for cycles. As such it is considered reasonable to impose a condition requiring replacement cycle parking to be provided. \r\rGiven the above, it is considered that the proposal would not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
