    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "\rSite\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Tudor Drive. The site is subject to the Tudor Estate - Local Area of Special Character designation. \r\rConsultations\r\r11x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact on car parking.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposal includes the construction of a single storey front extension.  Policy Guidance 38 (Front Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window.  The proposed front extension would be a distance of 720mm from the front an existing front bay window to the host property.\rThe proposed hipped to gable roof extension would cause a slight disruption to the symmetry of the pair of semidetached properties, of which the host property is part. However, a hipped to gable roof extension could be constructed within permitted development rights and the proposed rear dormer is not visible from the streetscene.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficers Comments: The proposed rear extension, would project 3 metres to the rear. It is considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  The Council seeks to preserve and enhance the character of LASCs by:\r- paying special attention to the character of each LASC when making decisions on planning applications\r- applying the policies in the Core Strategy: Policy CS 8 Character, Design and Heritage and DM 12 Development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets.\rAny new building needs to respect the particular character of the area and reflect the neighbouring development \rThe aim is to achieve a high standard of design that complements the surrounding area.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposed development would relate well to the host property and would appear acceptable within the streetscene. The proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building and wider area and the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character, in accordance with Policies DM10, DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012), D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021).\r\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The introduction of a single-storey front infill extension, would still allow the parking off street of at least two cars. Therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy and Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021.\r\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\t\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through a condition. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
