    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the flank elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Planning permission is required for the proposed roof extension.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The submitted proposed block plan does not show adjoining properties to the side and rear. Please provide a Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
