    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The finished floor levels of the development to which this permission relates shall be no lower than those of the existing building(s) as per the recommendations in the Flood Risk Assessment received by the local planning authority on 17th July 2020. \r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Officer report: \r\r5.\tSection 55(1) contains the central core of the definition and provides that developments may take one of two forms, namely, 'the carrying out of building, engineering, mining or other operations in, on, over or under land' or 'the making of any material change in the use of any building or other land.'\r\r6.\tSub section 55(1) (a) states that the term 'building operations' includes: \r(a)\tDemolition of buildings; \r(b)\trebuilding; \r(c)\tstructural alterations of or additions to buildings; and \r(d)\tother operations normally undertaken by a person carrying on a business as a builder. \r\r7.\tSection 55 (2) to 55 (2b) specifies a number of operations and uses which are not taken to involve development of the land. Of relevance to this application is s55(2)(a), which states: \rthe carrying out for the maintenance, improvement or other alteration of any building of works which - \r(i)\taffect only the interior of the building, or \r(ii)\t(ii) do not materially affect the external appearance of the building, \r\rThe proposed siting of the air handling unit at 2nd floor level on the balcony floor facing Cranes Park Avenue would materially affect the external appearence of the building by virtue of it's promient position and visibility from Carnes Park Avenue. As such, the proposal would amount to development under section 55, therefore permission wodl be required for it.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for condition 5 (Green Roof) of permission reference 21/03266/HOU have been assessed and are hereby approved.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\rPlanning History\r16/14453/HOU- Erection of single storey rear and side extension- GRANTED 05.07.2016\r16/15168/HOU- Erection of a single storey rear and side extension- GRANTED 04.01.2017\r22/00116/HOU- Erection of first floor side and rear extension - REFUSED 10.03.2022, for the following reason:-\rThe proposed development, by reason of its design and scale and contrast with the roof forms of the existing house, would appear as an incongruous and overdominant feature within the Aldridge Rise street scene and when viewed from the rear, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r11x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2x representations have been received, which highlight the following concerns:-\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- The Kingston Design Guide suggests \"Extensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth\" \r- The proposed extension would create an \"overpowering\" building in terms of height and bulk when viewed from the garden of no. 26 Aldridge Rise\r\rOf the 2x representations received, one representation made comments neither objecting to or supporting the Planning Application and highlighting the importance of Swifts.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety Assessment\r\rThe design of the proposed development\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proximity to the boundary of the proposed first floor side extension, despite the set-back in relation to the original dwellinghouse, would cause an unwanted terracing effect, combined with the featureless front elevation causing no activation of the street The proposed development, by reason of its design and scale and contrast with the roof forms of the existing house, would appear as an incongruous and overdominant feature within the Aldridge Rise street scene and when viewed from the rear, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012\r\rNeighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rOfficer Comment: There is an existing part two storey to the rear/side of no.22 Aldridge Rise. The proposed first floor extension would cause a slight loss of daylight and direct sunlight to existing ground floor rooflight windows above a kitchen and utility room and side facing windows at no.22 Aldridge Rise. However, this loss, is not considered that there would be a significant loss of light such as to refuse planning permission. Conditions are recommended regarding proposed side facing windows at first floor and above.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would project 6 metres to the rear of the neighbouring property at no.26 Aldridge Rise. However, the proposed first floor crown roofed extension is set away from the common shared boundary with no.26 and is to the north of this neighbouring property. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of daylight, or loss of direct sunlight.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development, by reason of its design and scale and contrast with the roof forms of the existing house, would appear as an incongruous and overdominant feature within the Aldridge Rise street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and an unwanted terracing effect. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
