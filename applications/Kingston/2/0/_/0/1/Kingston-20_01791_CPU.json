We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Officers have shared their concerns with the applicant over whether a Section 73 planning application is appropriate. Officers have accepted and considered a Counsel Opinion submitted by the applicant in response to this. However, the submitted Opinion does not address the fundamental concerns of the Local Planning Authority.",
