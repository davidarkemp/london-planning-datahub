    "The site comprises a detached dwellinghouse.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections have been received, relating to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Effects on trees\r- Privacy\r\rThe concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below. In regards to the concern raised surrounding the shared boundary, officers are satisfied that the appropriate ownership certificate has been signed and that no evidence has been submitted to contradict the submitted information. Boundary disputes between neighbours and other disputes, such as over rights of access, are a civil matter.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Two Storey Side Extension & Porch - \rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed two-storey side extension would fall outside the guidance of the Residential Design SPD (Policy Guidance 36), in regards to preserving a minimum of 1m from the front wall of the house dwelling, as a result of the new front porch. However, Lancaster Gardens has dwellings that benefit from similar side/front extensions and the side extension would otherwise generally follow all other guidelines set out under Policy Guidance 36. Therefore, the proposed front porch and side extension would not have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rSingle/Two-Storey Rear Extension- The proposed two-storey rear extension would not be unorthodox in the vicinity of Lancaster Gardens and would generally follow the guidance set out in the Residential design SPD (Policy Guidance 34) and whilst the proposed single/two storey rear extension would have a depth of 5.8m, exceeding the guidance of 3.5m, the extension is on a spacious site and would appear subordinate to the host dwelling. Therefore, the rear extension would not have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rDormer-\rThe proposed dormer would generally comply with Residential Design SPD, would be small in scale and would not be visible from the streetscene, officers consider that they would not be significant harm to the character and appearance of Lancaster Garden.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed two-storey rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties and neighbouring extensions, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A),  the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling. The site sits within Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Non designated heritage assets; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would have a large footprint, however it would have a modest height and appropriate roof form. Given that it would have a modest height and sit within a large rear garden, officers consider it would appear proportionate in relation to the existing dwelling and application site. Further, given that similarly scaled outbuildings can be viewed within the immediate surrounding area, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any\rapplication. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated\rheritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any\rharm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would appear proportionate to the host property and the site it is situated in, and would appear in keeping with host property. As such, officers consider that the proposed extensions would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Representations\r492no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations were received.\r\rConsultations\rRBK Environmental Health officer - No objection.\r\rProposals\rUpgrade of external wall finishes to improve the EWS1 rating\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tThe impact on the character and appearance of the area;\r-\tThe impact upon neighbouring properties; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy CS8 of the Core Strategy states that the Council will protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. Policy DM10 states that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design.\r\rThe proposal seeks to replace all of the existing weatherboarding and EWI system that have been identified as combustible with non-combustible variants without visually altering the appearance of the building.\r\rIn addition, the proposal includes the replacement of the Curtain Walling System on the west facing elevation (Skerne Road); this is to correct the fire spread related latent defect around the curtain walling openings.\r\rThe replacement materials will have the same visual effect as the existing, and they will not have any adverse effect on the character and appearance of the existing street scene.\r\rResidential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy advises that development must have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rThe proposed development would not cause any material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposal does not result in any harm to the amenity of neighbouring residents and is considered to be acceptable in terms of impact to the streetscene.\r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "The application site is located on the pavement on the south side of Elm Road opposite the junction of Cross Road and west of the junction with York Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The site is not in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\r21 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposed telecoms apparatus. \r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the proposed installation of 20m high slim-line monopole, supporting 6 no. antennas,1 no. wraparound equipment cabinet at the base of the monopole, 2 no. equipment cabinets, 1 no. electric meter cabinets, 1no. GPS module and ancillary development\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location  on Elm Road opposite and adjacent to a number of residential properties.\r\rThe height of the mast would be 20m which would be in excess of 10 to 12m higher than a standard street lamp column (10m) and a telegraph pole (8m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits. \r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.",
    "\rApplication Site\rThe site is semi-detached dwelling is located on a private residential road composed of predominantly 1920's 'inter-war' style detached properties. The site is not in a conservation area and is not statutorily or locally listed.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal is for the demolition of existing debilitated garage/ lean-to structure and erection of single-storey side extension with front and rear access.\r\rConsultation:\rNo representations were received from neighbouring occupiers.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway Safety\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the attached garage/storage space. The area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used for parking of cars, and so the conversion does not result in the loss of a space that would adversely impact upon highway safety.\r\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the materials on the elevations on the sides of the second storey piggyback extension from brick to a mixture of tile to match the existing roof slope, and render to match the rear of the house. In this case the applicant seeks to amend the proposal in such a way that would require an assessment of the merits of the changes and as such would fall outside the remit of a Section 96a application. Given the change in material and prominence of the extension within the surrounding area an assessment would have to be made to ensure that there is no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such, the proposed changes are considered not to be non-material.",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependant on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. \r\rThe local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Eaton Avenue.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing garage and erection of single storey wrap around side and rear extension. Alteration to front porch.\r\rThe proposal  relates to the refused planning application ref no 22/02668/HOU for Demolition of existing garage and erection of two storey-side and single-storey rear extension and alterations to front porch dated 12.10.2022\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Loss of parking\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposed front and side extension incorporating a porch would introduce a separation gap of approximately 0.9m. The proposed conversion of the garage into a habitable room with associated alterations is considered acceptable as the existing street scene contains similar examples. The proposed roof form over the front extension is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rAs such the proposed front and side elements of the proposal are considered to follow Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension due to its modest scale, siting and the proposed design is considered to appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling, in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that No 16 Eaton Avenue benefits from the rear extensions, therefore the proposed rear extension also due to its scale would not adversely affect amenities of the occupiers of this adjoining property. \r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would not result in an unacceptable impact on any habitable windows at No 12 Eaton Avenue, as per available planning history for this adjoining property. The proposed rear extension due to its modest scale and siting would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to this property. \r\rOfficers note the extended, raised patio area and the proposed privacy screens.  \rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe submitted information indicates that the existing garage and forecourt area are not of sufficient size to accommodate a car (the required size of hardstaning is 4.8m x 2.7m). Therefore it is accepted that it is not possible to accommodate an average sized car in either the garage or the forecourt area and so it can reasonably be concluded that the proposal will not result in any overspill parking on surrounding roads or result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Eton Avenue.\r\rAs such it is considered that the proposal is in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, the applicant has indicated a cycle parking provision in the rear garden to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r \rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the existing conservatory consists of a solid 3 metre wall on the boundary with No. 11 Malden Hill Gardens, For this reason, it is considered there will be no further loss of light should the proposed rear extension be approved. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rCase officer response: The proposed rear extension would project to a depth of 3.75 metres, which slightly exceeds SPD guidelines, however, it would project less than this beyond the rear building line of N0.81. The extension would be set away from the common shared boundary with no.81 Cobham Road by 0.12 metres.
