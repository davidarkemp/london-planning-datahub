    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The annex hereby permitted shall be occupied solely for purposes ancillary to the occupation and enjoyment of the main application property as a single dwelling and shall not be used as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship with the nearby residential uses in accordance Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "E4 - Acoustic Conditions in Schools",

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the reduction of the window on the rear elevation. Officers are satisfied that the alterations would not give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the area or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. Accordingly, the changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "Proposal Description - please confirm if you agree with the description which has been amended for clarity, or make changes as necessary:\r\"Alterations to front porch roof, rear extension roof and rear facade, installation of new windows to side elevation, floor plan redesign and all other associated works. Demolition of shed and erection of outbuilding to rear of garden.\""
