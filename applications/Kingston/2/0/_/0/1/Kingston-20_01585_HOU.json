    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling house located on Lower Green Gardens. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r \rProposal \rDemolition of existing conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r22/01524/HOU - Demolition of existing rear conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension refused on 06.07.2022 due to the impact on the adjoining property (insufficient information to demonstrate no unacceptable loss of daylight). \r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rOne representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r-excessive height or bulk of the proposal\r-appearance and design\r-loss of light/sunlight\r\rThe above concerns will be addressed with the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth which would be in this case up to 3.5m.  The proposed eaves height of approximately 2.7m and the total height of approximately 3.8m is considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy Guidance 33.\r\rGiven the proposed design and materials (matching the existing dwelling) and the scale of the proposed extension it is considered that it would appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. Due to the siting and the modest scale of the proposed extension it is considered that it would not have a significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would pass the 45 degree rule in elevation view with regards to the nearest ground floor patio door (which is not the only habitable opening to the open plan kitchen/dining room as per planning permission 00/05102/FUL) at the adjoining property No 36. Therefore it is considered that there would be no an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. \r\rThe proposed mass and bulk of the extension is considered to be acceptable and not resulting in an overbearing appearance. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling on Park Road.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received, relating to boundary lines. Officers acknowledge the representation recieved, however, matters related to the boundary disputes and land ownership, mentioned within the representations are civil matters between land owners. On the basis of the submitted information, and in the absence of evidence to the contrary, Officers are satisfied that the correct Certificate has been signed with the application form.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/00701/HOU - Demolition of existing side and rear extension, erection of part two storey/part single storey rear and single storey side extension -  Approved 27th May 2022\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Whilst the proposed single storey rear/side extension (similar to planning permission, 22/00701/HOU) would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm and the depth of 6 meters (4m from the neighbouring extension), officers note that it would be designed to respect the character of the original dwelling, and would appear a subordinate to the host property. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension spans the full width of the existing dwelling, which differs from planning permission 22/00701/HOU. The proposal would be visible from Parkfields Road and would not relate well to the main property, in regards to the flat roof design. Therefore, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of bulk, form and design. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted Fire Safety information, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
