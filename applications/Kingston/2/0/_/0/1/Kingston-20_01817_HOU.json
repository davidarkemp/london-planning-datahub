    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that sufficient land has been provided to accommodate the development.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 3 nos front and 1no rear rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed dormer extension, whilst not set below the main ridge line, is in keeping with the prevailing roof style of the host dwelling and replaces an otherwise incongruous flat roof extension. Officers also note a similar development to the neighbouring property at No.8 Ravenswood Avenue and other properties within the streetscene. External materials and fenestration would match the existing.\r\rAs such it is considered that it would appear an acceptable addition to the host property, and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and design of the proposed development, along with the absence of windows to the side elevation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\r\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
