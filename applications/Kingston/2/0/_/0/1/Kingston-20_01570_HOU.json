    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication site\rThe site comprises a detached building. The application site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rRelevant planning history\r14/16202/FUL -Change of use of ground floor from use as a school to use as a two-bedroom flat; together with associated alterations to the existing building, including a rear infill extension at ground floor level and installation of new roof lights, windows and side door - granted on 14.07.2014. \r\rProposal \rErection of single storey-detached outbuilding to be used as garden room.\r\rConsultations\r29 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed outbuilding would be approximately 4m deep and 8.7m wide, the proposed double pitched roof would be of a total height of approximately 3.7m. In terms of appearance and the proposed design it is considered to follow Policy Guidance 41 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rIt is understood that the existing detached storage would be demolished and the existing mature trees along the rear boundary would be removed to allow sufficient space for the new outbuilding.\r\rIt is noted that the entrance and proposed windows would be orientated to the south - the rear boundary of the application site and would be facing a shared access to the rear. \r\rGiven the above, the siting of the proposal, its design and size, the proposed outbuilding is not considered to represent an ancillary use to the host building as it would be capable of being used as a separate dwelling, independent to 6 Berrylands Road.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "It is drawn to the applicant's attention that under the provisions of section  9(2) of the Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990 (as amended) failure to comply with any condition attached to a listed building consent constitutes a criminal offence.\r\rFurthermore, the applicant is advised that the CCTV equipment which has been installed on site would require Listed Building Consent. The applicant is advised to apply for pre-application advice in the first instance, to progress this matter.\r\rIt is drawn to the applicants attention, that the siting of the projecting sign does not comply with the approved plans of app ref. 22/01183/ADV. This amounts to a breach of planning control. The applicant is advised to take remedial action immediately to avoid enforcement action.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r\r- Fumes\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe application is for continued residential use, and as such it is not considered that there would be a material increase in fumes. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rProposal\rOfficers note that the application site has had 3 previous refusals under ref:  22/00287/HOU, 22/00501/HOU and 22/01436/HOU. The principle issue with the refused applications were the proposed construction of a two storey rear extension with a flat roof. The proposal of these refused applications were similar in nature, and would have resulted in an extension that would have appeared visually dominant and out of keeping with the character of the host property. Officers note that the current application has omitted the first floor rear extension, thereby addressing the previous reasons for refusal. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the single storey rear extension would have a depth that is in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, it would have an appropriate height and as such would appear a subordinate addition to the host property. \r\rThe proposed front porch extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be adequately set up from the eaves or in set in from the sides of the roofslope, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, it would bet set down from the ridge line and as such would not appear a dominant addition to the roof slope. Further, given that a similar dormer extension is viewed within the immediate vicinity, officers consider that it would not appear out of keeping with the appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest height of the proposed rear extension and separation distance from the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
