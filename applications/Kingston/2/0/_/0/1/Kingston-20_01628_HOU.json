    "The proposed single storey rear extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight to the ground floor habitable room window of No. 242 Hook Road, nearest the shared boundary, by reason of its excessive depth and height. As such, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on residential amenity, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at Nos. 240 and 242 Hook Road. The proposed rear dormer extension, by virtue of its design, size and bulk, would fail to appear as a subservient addition. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 and paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
