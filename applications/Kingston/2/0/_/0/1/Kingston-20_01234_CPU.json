    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non designated heritage asset). A tree covered by a Tree Protection Order (TPO) is in close proximity to the site.\r\rProposal\rConversion of garage into habitable space, installation of 10 nos side rooflights and removal of chimney. Replacement of doors and windows, erection of gate.\r\rThis application follows a recently refused application 21/04026/HOU dated 28.02.2022 for the conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of two storey rear extension and single storey timber pergola. Alteration to fenestration, installation of 13nos side rooflights and hardstanding in the garden. Removal of chimney which was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1. The proposed pergola by virtue of its siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and that of the immediate surrounding area of special character, resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal would not accord with Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r2. The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area. The proposal would not accord with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed two storey rear extension and single storey timber pergola have been removed from the application in order to respond to the reasons for refusal. The number of proposed rooflights has also reduced from 13 to 10.\r\rA Certificate for Lawful Development application 21/03987/CPU dated 28.02.2022 was also refused. This application failed to meet the requirements under the legislation due to the proposed pergola.\r\rConsultation\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection and one neither objecting nor supporting have been received stating the following issues;\r- Privacy\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r\rOfficer Note: It is noted that concerns have been raised that the proposals include more than the 10 side roof lights stated in the description of development. \r\rA discrepancy on plan 252-005 Rev D (Existing and Proposed South and East Elevation) was discovered and in order to make all plans consistent, the applicant submitted 252-005 Rev E to align with the remaining plans and to show a consistant number of roof lights.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character; \r- The impact of the development on the a protected tree (TPO); and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note a number of properties on Neville Avenue benefit from rooflights. In addition, the property is of a relatively modern design and whilst the proposed rooflights would change the character of the property it would not result in a development that would be so out of character so as to be harmful to the wider area (a SASC). The proposed change in windows and door would result in a netural impact on the wider area. A planning condition requiring details of tinting for the windows would be attached to any grant of planning permission in order to limit the amount of light spill from the proposed roof lights.\r\rAs such, the development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 18 Neville Avenue to the west of the application site and Lorwood, Neville Avenue to the north of the application site. Officers note that there are no additional windows proposed for the north elevation so the proposed works are not considered to have any adverse impact on privacy or outlook with regards to Lorwood. In relation to No. 18 Neville Avenue, the proposed works would reduce the number of windows in the west elevation at the first floor level which would be an improvement to privacy for No. 18 Neville Avenue. \r\rThe proposed rooflights, should incorporate tinting in order to reduce loss of privacy and to minimise light spill to neighbouring properties and this woud be secure by condition should permission be granted. Overall,  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As stated above the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  As also set out above, it is considered that there would not be an adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposed development.  Therefore, it follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD, 2013 provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment: There is no loss of trees proposed and no development would be in close proximity to the roots of a TPO tree.  Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, it is considered that this matter would not warrant grounds for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. In relation to cycle parking, officers note that access to the garden will remain so it is possible for secure cycle parking to be provided in the garden despite the loss of possible storage within the existing garage. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
