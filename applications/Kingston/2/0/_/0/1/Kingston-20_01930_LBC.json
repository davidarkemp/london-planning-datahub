    "Consultations\r19no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Objection received from  five postal addresses. Comments summarised as follows:\r\r-\tBulk and Scale, particularly at the rear \r-\tLoss of light/privacy\r-\tOverbearing impact and loss of outlook\r-\tInappropriate design\r-\tInconsistency in submitted documents\r-\tImpact on parking conditions\r-\tNoise and disturbance\r\rOfficer comments: Duly noted. Please refer to main assessment of this report for full consideration.\r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: The applicant is proposing to create a new 3-bed residential dwelling which would be facilitated by demolition of an existing garage at the donor property. Whilst this would retain capacity for 2No vehicles to park at the donor property there would be no off-street parking for the new dwelling.\rThe applicant has submitted the results of a parking survey, following the Lambeth Methodology, which was undertaken on 7th and 8th February 2023. This showed that there is significant (above 100%) parking stress on Kings Avenue. Although there is some capacity on adjoining roads this development would clearly contribute to an already difficult situation for existing residents on Kings Avenue with respect to on-street parking availability. For this reason Highways do not support the application.\r\rPlanning History\r21/00891/HOU permission Granted on 18 May 2021 for Erection of part single, part two-storey side extension and single storey rear extension (following demolition of existing garage and conservatory)\r22/02833/FUL application withdrawn: Demolition of existing detached garage, erection of new two storey 3 bed dwelling with accommodation on roof space. Erection of single storey rear and roof extension with rear dormer to facilitate loft conversion in existing house.\r\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing detached garage, erection of a new two storey 3 bed dwelling with accommodation on roof space, with associated  alterations to the existing property  of the existing property, including  reconfiguration of first floor  and changes at roof level.\r\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the south side of Kings Avenue, close to the junction with Howard Road.  It comprises a two storey three bedroom house with detached garage. It is noted that a large ground floor rear extension is currently in the course of construction, although not shown on submitted plans (either existing or proposed) \r\rKings Avenue is residential in character, comprising mainly two storey housing with relatively uniform appearance, but with some variation in character and form.\r \rThere are no listed or locally listed buildings on site, or in close proximity, and the site is not within a conservation area.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1.\r\rThe proposal is a short walk from New Malden High Street and has a moderate PTAL of 3; it is not located within a controlled parking zone. \r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- Housing Delivery;\r- The standard of accommodation;\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r-Parking and Highways;\r- Refuse and recycling;\r- Sustainability; \r- Flood Risk and Drainage; and \r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\r\rHousing Delivery\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\r\rThe principle of creating an additional  residential unit within the application area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\r\rMix and Standard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants, and provide  a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3  or more bedrooms.  \r\rThe proposed  three bedroom dwelling would comply with the minimum standards set out by the London Plan and provides for family sized accommodation for which there is an identified need.    However, the  existing house  would become a two bedroom dwelling (as side windows are blocked by the proposed development). Effectively resulting in the loss of family sized dwelling.\r \rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows).  The DAS indicates a rear external amenity space of 50sqm and a front area of 20sqm. The plans indicate a rear garden area of 46 sqm.  Notwithstanding, the proposed development is reasonably compliant in this respect. \r\r\rFire Safety\rA Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety, in accordance with Policy D12 of the London Plan, 2021.However, officers consider that  as a  fire tender could park on the street outside the site, the matter can be adequately addressed by condition.\r\r\rCharacter and Appearance (including Impact upon Heritage Assets)\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings.\r\rPolicy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rDevelopment in the area surrounding the site is mixed in terms of age and architectural style. The general pattern of development is two storey dwellings laid out as pairs, or short terraces. The existing detached building is relatively  at odds with the prevailing street pattern, particularly its deep rear building line.\r\rThe proposal seeks the construction of a two storey dwelling with accommodation within the roof, attached to the existing building at 17 Kings Avenue. The proposed  new house would be contemporary in appearance,  of a height to match the  ridge height of the existing host building.  Whilst the detailed design is  in marked contrast to the architectural treatment of the host building, it is considered that the general alignment and proportions of the front elevation would be appropriate, subject to high quality detailing as indicated in the submitted design and access statement (DAS) . If the application were recommended for approval, it would be essential to secure high quality  detailing and materials by condition.\r\rThe proposal would include a flat roofed three storey side extension of the existing building. The Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design Guide' (2013) (SPD) sets out that with regards to two storey side extensions, the roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof form and that 'Flat roofs should generally be avoided unless they are consistent  with the form of the existing building's roof'.  Officers acknowledge that the SPD is guidance which should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. However,  the overall bulk and massing to the rear  is considered  to over dominate the host building. It would not relate well to the host property and would result in a dominant and obtrusive form of development and detract  from the character of the area as seen from the rear gardens of neighbouring  houses,  presenting as an incongruous  and boxy addition with large flat roofs at ground,  first and second floor. This would be  particularly prominent as the extended building would project beyond the prevailing rear building line in this part of Kings Avenue, and due to the close separation from the  eastern boundary ((700cm). The proposed  building would also detract from the appearance of the host building due to this  bulk and form of the extensions at first and second floor levels. It  would also  overly extend the existing building. Officers consider that this would harm the character and appearance of the area. In these respects, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable \rlevels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe proposed dwelling would project  significantly beyond the rear building line of 21 Kings Avenue, with a substantial flank wall  (16 metres in depth at ground floor) just 700mm from the neighbouring  boundary. Whilst the first and second floor elements  are  of reduced depth the DAS indicates that the building would be sited 2.8 metres  further in depth  at first and second floor levels than the adjacent building at No.21. Whilst there appear to be inconsistencies with the drawings and the DAS (drawings show a setback of approximately 1 metre at second floor level), the proposal would nonetheless present  as an imposing bulk and mass. The expanse of brickwork and sheer wall of two and three storeys in such close proximity to the boundary would cause an uncomfortable sense of enclosure and overbearingness, and loss of openness and outlook, particularly when utilising the patio area to the rear of No21.\r\rAlthough the applicant has submitted a daylight, sunlight and over shadowing assessment, this is limited in scope and  considers only the  impact on overshadowing of amenity spaces to neighbouring gardens, which would satisfy BRE criteria in this respect with  the neighbouring gardens retaining over 80% of their existing values. However, no assessment has been undertaken on the impact of loss of light to windows to the neighbouring properties.  In terms of  21 Kings Avenue, it is noted that there is a first floor bedroom window on the rear elevation, the submitted details indicate that the proposed extension would not  infringe both the 45 degree angle on plan and elevation.  Other windows within the flank wall of this property serve non habitable rooms. Officers consider that  the  proposed would not materially impact lighting conditions to this neighbouring  property.  \r\rThe dwelling includes windows on the rear elevation at ground, first and second floor levels. Noting the objections received,  given the positioning of windows within the existing house, it is not considered that the additional windows  would give rise to any material loss of privacy that could substantiate grounds for refusal. No windows are proposed within the flank elevation. \r\rOfficers consider that the above impacts would amount to material harm to the living conditions of the occupiers of 21 Kings Avenue due to the length, combined with the siting, massing, bulk and height of the dwelling as a result of an increased sense of enclosure, overbearingness and loss of openness and outlook. In these respects, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. This is afforded significant weighting against the proposals in the overall assessment.\r\rParking and Highways\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. The maximum parking standard for the new dwelling proposed is 1 space.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rPrevious application for extensions accepted the loss of the garage, noting that the internal dimensions of the garage would not conform to the modern dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD.  \r\rThe application form states 2 car parking spaces would be retained, and an email from the agent confirms that this would be for the existing dwelling, and no  parking is proposed for the new three bedroom dwelling.   No plans have been provided to detail the parking arrangement. The area in front of the  host building was previously enclosed by a boundary wall, but this has been removed at some point since 2020.   \r\rIt is proposed to create a new 3-bed residential dwelling which would be facilitated by demolition of an existing garage at the donor property. Whilst  it is advised that  the host property would retain capacity for 2No vehicles to park, there would be no off-street parking provided for the new dwelling. As noted above, the Highway authority  does not support this application as the results of the submitted parking survey  showed that there is significant (above 100%) parking stress on Kings Avenue.  They advise that although there is some capacity on adjoining roads, this development would clearly contribute to an already difficult situation for existing residents on Kings Avenue with respect to on-street parking availability. \r\rIf the proposal were found to be acceptable it would be appropriate to ensure  that the development were car capped to prevent eligibility to a residents car parking permit scheme if a CPZ were to be  introduced into the area at a future time. \r\rIt has not been demonstrated that the lack of parking with the proposed development, coupled with the existing  parking stress within Kings Avenue,  can be accommodated within  the street without  avoiding an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions and road safety issues in the surrounding highway network. The proposed development would not comply with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.  \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2, ensuring that a minimum of two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided for the proposed three bedroom house. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards. \rCycle parking for 2no. cycles is shown at the rear  of the proposed building.  However, officers note that the cycles would be very difficult to access given the length of the side passage and the narrow separation of 70 cm from the boundary, and the standard width of the handlebars is 40-44cm. \r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house. The refuse store is shown to the rear, again the length and the width of the passage would make access difficult (standard width of 240 litre wheelie bin 57.5cm\r\r\r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2021 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency, which could be secured by way of condition.\r\r\rDrainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to incorporate sustainable drainage systems unless there are compelling reasons for not doing so.\r\rThe application form states that the proposed development would incorporate a sustainable drainage system but no details of this system have been provided. It is considered that details of the system could be secured by a suitably worded condition.\r\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. \r\rThe development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 3, for which the charge is £85 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5 year housing supply. \r \rThe proposed development would provide 1no. net additional 3-bedroom market housing unit. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposal. However, it is noted that the  existing house  would become a two bedroom dwelling resulting in the loss of family sized dwelling, and therefore tempering the benefit of the additional family house.\r\rThe proposed development,  due to the bulk and massing to the rear  is considered  to over dominate the host building and detract  from the character of the area as seen from the rear gardens of neighbouring  houses,  presenting as an incongruous  and boxy addition. This is afforded moderate weight against the proposal.\r\rIn terms of impact upon neighbouring amenity, the proposals are considered to result in harm to the occupiers 21 Kings Avenue in terms of impact upon outlook and sense of overbearing and visual dominance as a result of the proposed siting and scale of the proposed development. Officers assign significant weighting against the proposals in the overall planning balance exercise in this regard.\r\rIt has not been demonstrated that the lack of parking with the proposed development, coupled with the existing  parking stress within Kings Avenue,  can be accommodated within  the street without  avoiding an unacceptable impact on local parking conditions and road safety issues in the surrounding highway network. This is afforded moderate weight against the proposal \r\rThere is cycle and refuse/recycling storage to serve the proposed development. However, the facilities would be difficult to access due to the length of the narrow side access. This is assigned  limited weighting against the proposal. \r\rThe proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and it is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the provision of one 3-bedroom dwelling house in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rIt is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.\r",
