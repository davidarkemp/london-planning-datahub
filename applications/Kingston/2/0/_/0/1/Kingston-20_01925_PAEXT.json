    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, a Strategic Area of Special Character and the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed rear extension would not generally comply with the guidance set out in Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD, in regard to the proposed depth of 5.4m. However, it would maintain a reasonable distance from the neighbouring properties, it would not be visible from the street scene and it would still appear subordinate to the host dwelling. The pergola would be an unusual addition the Park Road but as stated above it would also not be visible from the streetscene and would appear proportionate.\r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the retrospective development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, although the proposed development would not generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD, it would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area as it would not be visible from the streetscene, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character or the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
