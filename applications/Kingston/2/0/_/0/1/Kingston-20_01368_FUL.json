    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed vehicular crossover would have an acceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on the southern side of Deacon Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any environmental or physical constraints, but is identified in the Kingston Core Strategy as a key view area.\r\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a single storey side and rear extension.\r\rPlanning History:\rThe proposal follows refused scheme 21/01890/HOU for the following reason:\r\r'Due to the excessive scale and siting of the proposed development, it would result in an unneighbourly extension that would unduly impact on the outlook and result in an undue sense of enclosure for the occupants of No. 36 Deacon Road. As such the proposed development would not conform to Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.'\r\rThe proposed scheme makes the following changes:\r\rSingle storey rear extension (as it relates to No.36) has been reduced in depth to 3m.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension, would be setback from the principal elevation of the host dwelling, with a modest eave height and pitched roof appearing a proportionate and subordinate addition when viewed from the street. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would integrate with the side extension and project a modest distance beyond the existing rear extension maintaining the pitched roof and external materials of the side extension, and rooflights only to the side elevation.\r\r\r\r\r\r\rThe proposed rear extension on the opposite side of the dwelling would infill the area between the application property and No.36 Deacon Road and would accord with the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, with a modest eave height and pitched roof design.  \r\rHaving regard to the above officers do not consider the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the surrounding area in terms of scale, spacing and design. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side extensions would be located directly on the shared boundaries with Nos. 32 and 36 Deacon Road.\r\rOfficers note however the eave height of the proposed extension as it relates to No.32 is 2m above ground level and accords with the 25 degree BRE guidance for sunlight/daylight. \r\rThe proposed rear extension as it relates to No.36 projects 3m from the rear elevation (in accordance with the SPD)with a modest eave height. Officers also note the side elevation of the rear extension incorporates full height glazing to create a more lightweight structure and appearance as it relates to the neighbouring property at No.36 Deacon Road. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers do not consider the proposal would adversely impact on the amenities of the occupants of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light/sunlight, loss of privacy or overbearing appearance. \r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and Plans which demonstrate the provision of a suitable evacuation assembly point and fire safety measures within the building to comply with the London Plan. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r\r\r\r",
