    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any new windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the north-eastern or south-western flank elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Southborough Conservation Area and is covered by an area Tree Protection order (TPO). The site is also adjacent to and opposite locally listed buildings of townscape merit.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing rear extension. Erection of single-storey rear extension, first floor front/side extension above existing garage, new porch, new roof with 3no rear dormer roof extensions, installation of 2no side and 3no front rooflights, associated changes to fenestration\r\rThis application follows previously refused application 22/00066/HOU dated 09.03.2022 which was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1) The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021).\r\r2) The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area. The proposal would not accord with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rand application 22/01802/HOU dated 22.07.2022, which was refused for the following reason;\r\r1) The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area. The proposal would not accord with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThis application would need to address the reasons for refusal.\r\rConsultation\r49 Neighbouring properties have been notified and one representation neither supporting or objecting has been received requesting materials used to match the existing.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - This is a resubmission and as SCAAC did not object to the previous submission, there is no objection this time. There is no adverse impact on CA.\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer -  No objection to the proposals. My only observations would be that compliance with the submitted and approved Arb Report, Impacts Assessment & Tree Protection Plan should be conditioned within any forthcoming permission and that we should also seek a landscape plan securing the replacement of the Magnolia on the frontage due to be removed for reasons of health and safety.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the Southborough Conservation Area; \r- The impact of the development on TPO's;and\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The windows to the rear have been reduced in size and will now reflect the existing windows to the front of the property. The proposed dormers appear less jarring and more in keeping with the character and appearance of the area. It is now considered that there would not be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The applicant has submitted an arboricultural assessment and tree protection plan to support the application. Therefore, it is considered that the applicant has demonstrated through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
