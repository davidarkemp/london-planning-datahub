    "The site comprises a two-storey detached dwelling. The site is located in Astor Close which is part of the Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance and the Strategic Area of Special Character of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill. \r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\rHistoric England (Archaeology) - No Comment\r\rProposal\rThis assessement will strictly be based on the proposed two storey front extension stated within the application form and excludes the first floor rear extension demonstarted in the submitted plans/elevations.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and, \r- The impact of the development on protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rPolicy Guidance 38 of the Residential Design SPD (Front Extensions) states:\rWhen designing a front extension the following guidance will apply:\r- Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window.\r- New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition.\r- Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation.\r- The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house.\r- All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties.\r- Front extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported.\r- Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rWhilst the proposed front extension would extend across the entire frontage, officer acknowledge that the proposal would appear as part of the, original building and not be an obvious addition and would be design to respect the symmetry of the existing front elevation and features of the adjoining properties. The proposal would create a uniform building line with No. 2 and No.3 Cotswold Close, adding to the charater and apperance of the wider area and host dwelling.\r\rOverall, officer consider the proposed development to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the retrospective development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The dimensions of the existing garage would safely accommodate on-site car parking and would provide cycle parking compyling with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. However, it is noted that the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide 2 adequate car parking spaces, which would be acceptable levels of on-site car parking. Officers acknowledge the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, however, the side access to the rear of the proporty would be conducive for future safe cycle storage.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would generally be in keeping with host property, as the proposal would resemble the exisiting front elevation in design and respect the design of neighbouring properties No.2 and No.3 Cotswold Close. Additionally, the proposed two storey front extension would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, rarther preserve it, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and the Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rHistoric England (Archaeology) was consulted on this proposal and provided a comment stating that the proposed development would not fall under within the following catergories:\r\r- Major planning applications over 0.5 hectares whether in an APA or not\r- Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping requests and Environmental Statements\r- Applications supported by an archaeological desk-based assessment\r- Minor planning applications in any APA (tiers 1 to 3)\r- Domestic basement applications in APA tiers 1 and 2 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers consult GLAAS on any domestic basement in an APA.\r- Householder and equivalent-scale very minor applications in APA tier 1 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers do not consult GLAAS on householder or equivalent applications unless within 50m of a scheduled monument.\r- Proposed substantial demolition or major alterations to historic buildings\r- Submission of details in relation to archaeological conditions\r- Appeals on applications for which an archaeological issue has previously been identified\r\rAs such, no comment would be required from Historic England (Archaeology).\r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) states that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: While no arboricultural information has been submitted, it is noted that the proposed front extension would be on a site which have no protected tree species. Officer acknowledge that there are Cherry Species on neighbouring properties No.2 and No. 3 Cotswold Close however the proposal would be built at a substantial distance from the nearest one (approx 10m). Therefore the proposed development would not result in any direct adverse impact on protected trees on site.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed two storey front extension would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
