    "Due to its flat roof design the proposed roof form of the two storey side extension would result in an incongruous and jarring appearance from the existing street scene and would not relate well to the main dwelling or the surrounding area, thereby conflicting with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the proposed rear extension would extend beyond the rear wall by a total depth of 6m, falling outside the guidance of 3.5m, as advised in the Residential Design SPD. It would respect the 3m flat roof height set out in the guidance, it would not be visible in the street scene and would appear proportionate and subordinate as similar materials are proposed. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.  Additionally, the applicant has approval for the 6m deep element of the proposed rear extension through planning application 22/01941/PAEXT, which can be used as a fallback and constructed irrespective of concerns surrounding amenity.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Officer acknowledge that the applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement, that includes the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
