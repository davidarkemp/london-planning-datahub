    "Any replacement trees which within a period of five years from planting are removed, die or become seriously damaged/diseased, shall be replaced within the next planting season (Oct 1st - Apr 30th) with trees of similar amenity value.\n\nAny replacement planting should be carried out with due consideration for overhead and underground services, property boundaries, buildings and potential maintenance. The eventual size of a specimen and the nature of its rooting structure should also be taken into account when choosing where to plant, in order to achieve the best result for your site.\n\nThe applicant is advised that the following would be suitable species:\n\n(a) [Tulip Tree (Liriodendron tulipifera)]",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\n\n21 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received raising the following material planning considerations: \n\n- Car park issues\n- Inappropriate design/layout\n- Noise\n\nThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\n\nThe key areas of assessment are: \n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \n- Fire Safety Assessment.\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \n\nOfficer Comment: While the proposed rear extension would have a depth that would be in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, the proposed extension would have a modest height and as such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original dwelling or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \n\nThe proposed porch infill extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \n\nOfficer Comment: Given that the proposed rear extension would not extend any further in depth than the existing garage extension, and the proposed porch would be modest in scale,  it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nFurther, given that the proposal would be suitably separated from the neighbouring property 16 Windmill Rise, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \n\nGiven that the proposal would be for a continued residential use, officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise and disturbance as a result of the proposed development.\n\nTransportation\nPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\n\nPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\n\nOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would result in the existing garage being converted to habitable space, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would not be wide enough to comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision. As such, officers consider that the proposal would result in the loss of on-site car parking.\n\nNon designated heritage assets\nParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\n\nPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\n\nOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would appear an appropriate addition to the host property and as such, officers consider that the proposed extension would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it.\n\nFire Safety Assessment\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
