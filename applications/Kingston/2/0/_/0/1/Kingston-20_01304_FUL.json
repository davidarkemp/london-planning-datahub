    "Within 3 months from the date of this permission, manufacturer(s) details of the privacy film (to a minimum of level 3 on the Pilkington Scale) for the first floor windows of the modular building on the north, south and east facing elevations shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to provide obscurity to level 3 on the Pilkington Scale.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on The Roystons. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rRetrospective application for erection of 6ft wall to cover half the drive (wall to form part of storage space to house a large heavy wheelchair bike).\r\rConsultations\r18 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Car Parking Facilities\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current proposal is a retrospective application for the erection of a front boundary wall that would be approximately 1.8m high and made of solid rendered wall that would be painted in white as per submitted drawing (Proposed Front Drive Layout and 3D view). This development would involve relocation of a dropped kerb and formation of a new hardstanding for car parking purposes. \r\rTypically, boundary treatments in the surrounding area and of properties fronting The Roystons comprises low brick walls, paired with vegetation or no front boundary treatment retaining openness, permeability and a softer and 'green'  appearance. The proposed solid rendered wall approximately 1.8m high would introduce a more oppressive appearance to the open character of the area and, as such, would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. Similarly, the proposed bike store would be overly bulky and prominently sited such that it would be an incongruous feature within the street scene. \r\rOfficers note personal circumstances of the occupiers, however no robust evidence and information has been submitted to demonstrate the need for this specific form of development which has been found to be detrimental to the character and appearance of the area. It is unclear whether an alternative form of development could meet the needs of the occupants. For example, Drawing No. JMS.1.CD10 shows a much smaller cycle store than has been built.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting in relation to neighbouring properties would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking Facilities\rOfficers note no car parking restrictions on The Roystons and as the proposal would still accommodate one off street car parking space the proposal is considered to be acceptable in terms of quantum of on-site car parking provision.\r\rHowever, it is unclear whether the proposed re-located car parking space would have sufficient pedestrian visibility sightlines/splays. The 1.8m high front boundary wall would obstruct views above 600mm which could result in a harm to pedestrian safety (especially childern) when vehicles enter/exit the site. The proposed development is therefore considered to adversely impact pedestrian and highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 45 (Non Road Mobile Machinery) of planning permission 20/02014/FUL, which states:\r\rCondition 45 (Non Road Mobile Machinery) - Non Road Mobile Machinery: Prior to the commencement of development the developer/construction contractor shall sign up to the Non-Road Machinery Register and the details of all non-road mobile machinery to be used on site through the construction phrase must be recorded on the database <https:/Inrmm.london/ . The development shall be carried out in accordance with the NRMM Regulations and the inventory of all NRMM used on site shall be maintained and provided to the Local Planning Authority upon request to demonstrate compliance with the regulations.\r\rReason: To reduce the emissions of construction and demolition in accordance with the Mayor of London Control of dust and Emissions during Construction and Demolition SPG July 2014. Compliance is required to be prior to commencement due to the potential impact at the beginning of the construction.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 comments in support and 1 neutral representation has been received. \r\rSurbiton CAAC - No objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposal would convert the garage into habitable space and would result in an alteration of the front garage door to a window on the front elevation. Given that the window would be in keeping with the existing windows on the front elevation, the proposal would appear an appropriate addition to the host property and in keeping with the surrounding area.\r\r Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the extension and separation distance, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rOfficers note that a window is proposed to the side elevation at first floor level, however to mitigate against any potential loss of privacy, a condition could be imposed to ensure that the opening is obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
