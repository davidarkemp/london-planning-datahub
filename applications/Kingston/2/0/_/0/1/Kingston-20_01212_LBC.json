    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rPlanning History\r22/01071/HOU-Alteration to fenestration and roof - GRANTED 26.05.2022\r\r8x neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters ; and,\r- Fire safety.\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the conversion of the existing garage to the side of the property. However, the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate one space for on-site parking. The PTAL for this part of Bransby Road is 2. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1 space per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 2 - 3, 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: Due to an absence of secure cycle parking details within the submitted plans, the applicant has not demonstrated compliance with the cycle parking standards set out in the London Plan. It is considered that these details should be secured via condition.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through condition.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear/side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, however it would have an appropriate height and as such would appear a proportionate addition to the host property. Given that similar extensions are viewed within the immediate vicinity, officers consider that it would not detract from the appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed side and rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however it would be set down from the ridge line, and slightly in from the eaves and sides of the roofslope, and as such would appear a proportionate addition to the host property. The proposed dormers would be finished largely in slate and lead, which would largely appear in keeping with the slate roof. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r \rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk assessment within the design and access statement states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any\rapplication. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated\rheritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any\rharm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would be a modest addition to the host property and would appear in keeping with host property. As such, officers consider that the proposed extensions would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
