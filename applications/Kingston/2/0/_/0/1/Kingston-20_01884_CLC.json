    "Due to the insufficient and inconsistent information submitted regarding the proposed cycle parking spaces in relation to Condition 26 (Secure Cycle Parking Facilities) of planning permission ref 19/01207/FUL, the proposal is considered not to ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities, in conflict with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers acknowledge that the two storey side extension would be set down by approximately 500mm from the ridge of the original roof line, however, the proposed roof form would not respect the roof form of the host dwelling. Furthermore, the proposed two storey side extension would not be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties, falling out of line with Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 36 (Two Storey Side Extension). The proposal due to it's scale, mass and siting would not appear subordinate to the original dwellinghouse. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development for the erection of two storey side extension is considered unacceptable and it is considered that there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, '25 & 45 Degree' Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting and distance of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances / an evacuation assembly point could be secured by condition, and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development for the erection of two storey side extension would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
