    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, located on the north western side of Somerset Avenue.\r\rThe proposal relates to the retention of an existing two storey side extension and part single storey, part two storey rear extension\r\rPlanning History\r18/10209/HOU- Erection of two storey side extension and part single storey, part two storey rear extension GRANTED 03.08.2018.\r\r5x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one objection has been received, which highlights the following summarised concerns:-\r-The extension is not as the drawings depict;\r- The workmanship and finish is of poor quality and the render patchy; \r- The brickwork is uneven; and,\r- The extension is tall and looms over a neighbouring garden.\r\rCase Officer Response:- The concerns raised in relation to the standard of workmanship is not a material planning concern in this case. The matters of the impact of the proposed development on character and design, the impact of the proposed development upon neighbouring residential amenity and the accuracy of the submitted plans will be assessed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. and the accuracy of the submitted plans. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that planning permission was previously granted on this site for the erection of a two storey side extension and part single storey, part two storey rear extension, in August 2018 (18/10209/HOU). Whilst visible from other properties on Somerset Avenue, overall the development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there are no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The depth of the ground floor extension applied for as part of this application is the same as that approved with planning permission 18/10209/HOU at 4.635 metres. The depth of the first floor extension applied for with the current application, is the same as that approved with planning permission 18/10209/HOU at 3.54 metres. The height of the ground floor extension applied for as part of this application would be 3.2 metres, as opposed to the 2.79 metres approved as part of planning permission 18/10209/HOU. \r\rNotwithstanding the comparative increase in the height of the single storey rear extension element, as No.158 is set away from the shared boundary with no.156 Somerset Avenue and the application site sits to the north of this neighbouring property, it is considered that there is no unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No.158.\r\rOfficers note that there is an existing ground floor extension to the rear of No.154 Somerset Avenue. As a result of this existing extension, it is considered that the existing development does not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of no.154, by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light.\r\rThe applicant has indicated on the submitted drawings that neither of the flank walls at first floor level, include side facing windows and a condition is recommended in this regard, to protect neighbouring privacy and prevent overlooking.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide existing and proposed roof plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged."
