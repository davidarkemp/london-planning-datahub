    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it.",
    "Free-gos do not apply to Certificate of Lawful Development applications therefore a fee of Â£103.00 is required."
