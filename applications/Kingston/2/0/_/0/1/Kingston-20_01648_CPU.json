    "The erection of a rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Craven Road.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey side extension including relocation of entrance.\r\rConsultations\r13  properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposed single storey side extension with the front porch follows Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the proposed depth and height and the proposed roof design. The proposed extension would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 1m. It is considered that due to its siting and scale it would not result in a terracing effect, despite being set along the existing detached garage. \r\rThe proposal would be fully visible within the street view, however given its scale and the proposed design it is considered that it would not have a significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered to be sufficient. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The drawing no ' 3921/009 RevT' is labelled as Existing and Proposed Front Elevation, whereas the proposed front elevation is different from drawing no '3921/018 RevT Proposed Front Elevation'. Please amend the front elevation with the correct labelling.\r\rWe reveived only one side elevation, please submit both existing and proposed side elevations"
