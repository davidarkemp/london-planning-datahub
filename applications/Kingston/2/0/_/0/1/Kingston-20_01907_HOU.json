    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Scheme Design Amendments S96a Ref. 20/01595/NMA.\rA review of the Phase 1 (detailed element) of the Approved Scheme and identified several amendments was undertaken which were secured under S96a approval Ref. 20/01595/NMA. One of the amendments was the removal of the permanent café structure with a pop-up solution. Detailed justification was provided in a cover letter:. A replacement plan schedule was also provided in the cover letter which substituted the approved \"Pavilion Café Drawings\" set and landscape plans, removing the café structure and replacing with an area identified for the later pop-up solution.\r\rIn addition, a non-residential commentary was prepared by Forty Group which provided additional market justification on why a pop-up solution was more suited to this location: it would provide flexibility, savings and better able to adapt to activities. It could take a number of forms and this would be controlled.\r\rFor the avoidance of doubt, each of the replacement plans, cover letter and non-residential commentary were attached as informative on to the Decision Notice.\r\rLetter dated Nov 2021: Pop-Up Café Solution\r\rEven before COVID-19, feedback on a café operator taking the café space was not positive. COVID has exacerbated problems for the food and beverage industry, and whilst hopeful of a recovery, there is lots of available alternative space.\r\rThe Phase 1 scheme includes buildings to the north of Tolworth Square and less than a third of the overall development. Whilst the new square will be created from the beginning - it will still be just 211 homes. The critical mass to support a dedicated café will not be there.\r\rLonger term, the proposed changes to the Café Strategy and Tolworth Square will result in a scheme which is more adaptable and functional part of the whole development. It is TGP's intention that this space can be utilised as a flexible space which can accommodate events such as bookfairs and community market events. A permanent café structure and associated leases would inhibit this.\r\rA pop-up solution will be of interest to local businesses and start up Food and beverage operators, that often can't afford the overheads of permanent space. The outline area will remain for the immediate future until reserved matters/new application approval. TGP will need to take an innovative approach to this area in the interim and a flexible approach will be help appeal to the widest possible range of meanwhile activities and uses.\r\rThe inclusion of a pop-up solution has clear benefits to both operator and residents by providing a more expansive operation that can become a focal point of the scheme, whilst allowing flexibility to adapt throughout the seasons.\r\rThe savings generated by the landlord through the delivery of a flexible solution can be passed onto the tenant, and the ability to purchase a fitted café container product provides further savings.\r\rIn addition, the ability to combine the space as a focal point for local events and community activity further expands on stakeholders' aspirations to support social inclusion and community interaction.\r",
