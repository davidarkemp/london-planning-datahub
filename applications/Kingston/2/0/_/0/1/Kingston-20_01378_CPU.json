    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r\r- Privacy\r- Effects on trees\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers note that the proposed part single storey/part two storey side extension would largely not be in keeping with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD. While the proposal would be set in from the shared boundary, and would propose an appropriate roof form which would have a ridge height that is subordinate to the host property, the proposed extension would have an extensive footprint which would not appear proportionate to the host property, and would be finished in dark grey zinc cladding and white or grey render brick which would contrast substantially with the materials of the original dwelling.\r\rAlongside this proposed extension, the proposed rear and side roof extension with rear and side dormer roof extensions would not be appropriately set down from the ridge line, or in from the eaves of the roof slope. The proposed extensions would appear to wrap around the original roof slope from the side to the rear and given that the proposal would be finished in a mixture of zinc, timber cladding and render. Officers also note that front dormer roof extensions are not a characteristic feature within Upper Park Road, and as such would not appear in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development.  Officers consider that by reason of design, siting, form and mass the proposed extensions at roof level would appear dominant and would substantially alter the original character of the dwelling.\r\rThe single storey rear extension would largely meet the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD, given the modest scale, and as such would appear a proportionate and appropriate addition to the host property.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed extensions would not extend the footprint closer to 19 Upper Park Road, and as such given the separation distance, would not not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light\r\rIn regards to 15 Upper park road, the proposed extension would not extend to meet the rear elevation of 15 Upper Park Road, and given that the side facing windows on the flank wall of 15 Upper Park Road at ground and first floor level do not relate to habitable rooms as shown in planning permission ref: 18/00305/HOU, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rOfficers note that the proposal would include side facing windows at roof level, and to mitigate against any potential loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure they are obscure glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rGiven the extensive footprint of the development, In the event of an approval, a CEMP condition would be imposed to ensure the development can be delivered in a way that would be respectful of the residential area and minimise disruption to neighbours.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would convert the existing garage into habitable space, the proposal would construct an internal garage to accommodate on-site car parking. The proposal would alter the front boundary wall and construct a dropped kerb to facilitate the re-positioning of the garage. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed boundary treatment would remain a low level, and as such officers consider that there would be enough visibility to safely enter and exit the site. Therefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety.\r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that there are a number of TPOs on site, and given that the applicant has not sufficiently demonstrated through a detailed Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection plan, how the proposal would impact these protected trees on site, officers consider that the proposed development would have an adverse harm to the protected trees on site. The proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNon-designated Heritage Assets\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, due to the design, siting, form and massing officers conclude that the proposed development would result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, and could result in the loss of protected trees on site. The proposed development would not be architecturally in keeping with elements of the original dwelling or surrounding properties, and as such would detract from the character of the immediate surrounding area.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
