    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey rear extension\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Common boundary along No 48 is as specified on the land registry plan  \r\rOfficer comment: Any matters controlled under non-planning laws such as ownership of the site or boundary issues are not material planning considerations and they cannot be included within the assessment. Other concerns will be addressed with this report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed modest depth of the replacement extension is considered to be in-keeping with the adjoining properties. The proposed eaves height would be similar to the existing extension at the adjoining property No 48 (planning permission ref 19/02873/FUL). \r\rThe proposed modern design and materials  due to their siting and scale are considered to be acceptable. The proposal would be partially visible from Park Farm Road.\r\rThe proposed approximately 2m high brick wall along the common boundary with No 48 and along the proposed south elevation of the new patio area (up to 30sm high) is considered to be acceptable. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable openings in the rear elevations at the both adjoining properties, therefore the proposal would not result in an uncaptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties. \r\rDue to the modest depth of the proposal, siting and the proposed design, it is not considered to appear as an overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Fire Exception Statement which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rRaising roof height, erection of piggy-back roof extension and installation of 5nos side rooflights. Reinstate chimney at front.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed piggy back roof extension would be set back approximately 4m from the front elevation and would not increase the height of the eaves and ridge by more than 1.3m, in accordance with Policy Guidance 40.\r\rThe proposed brickwork and white painted timber fascia would be similar to the existing one. \r\rDue to the siting of the proposal and relatively small separation distance the proposal would not be highly visible within Burton Road. Officers note the existing piggy back roof extension at the adjoining property No 44. \r\rThe proposed glazing to the rear elevation comprising double sliding doors with side lights and glazed triangular top section due to its excessive scale and the proposed design would not be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding properties. \r\rDue to its siting the proposed glazing to the rear would be visible within Park Farm Road also resulting in adverse impact on the existing street scene. \r\rOverall, the proposed glazing to the rear due to its excessive scale and the proposed design would not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area and it would adversely affect the character and appearance of the existing street scene. As such the proposal is in conflict with Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed roof extension due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the nearest habitable openings at both adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties. \r\rOfficers note the proposed separation distance from the rear elevation of the proposed roof extension to the existing side elevation at the adjoining property No 2 Park Farm Road to the rear would be approximately 15.2m. \r\rBased on the Goole maps, the existing openings to the side dormer at No 2 Park Farm Road appear to be habitable openings. The proposed glazing would be located opposite these windows and would be directly overlooking the rear garden at this adjoining property. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the existing windows in the rear elevation at the application site are located similarly to the proposed roof extension, however the scale of the proposed glazing is considered unneighbourly and due to its prominent position it would result in loss of privacy in relation to No 2 Park Farm Road. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r10 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of an editing rear conservatory, erection of single storey rear and front porch. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.  \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the demolition of an existing rear conservatory, erection of a single storey rear and front porch extension. \r\rThe existing Edwardian style conservatory projects a depth of 2.98m  set in from the shared close boarded boundary fence.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension would project a depth of 4.5m and extend the full width of the dwelling. It would have a dual aspect roof  accommodating  2 nos rooflights.  Whilst the depth of the proposed single storey rear extension  would be contrary to the recommendation as set out in Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD (2013), taking account of the fact  the dwelling is at the end of terrace, the proposal is deemed acceptable. \r\rIn addition, the proposal includes a front porch extension. The existing front elevation presents a dual aspect pitch roof/ canopy which is supported by  columns. The application seeks to extend and enclose the 'porch' area  and to present a single aspect roof.  The design of the porch is not too dissimilar to other  enclosed porches within the residential development.\r\rFor both extensions, the proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at no 18 Woodall Close.\r\rIn considering the impact on daylight at no 18 by the proposed extension, the proposals would pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable room window. It is noted that the ground floor of the property is served by  patio doors and a single window to a living room area. Within this context, it is considered that  there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour. \r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Consultations and Terms of Reply\r13 individual notification letters were sent and no responses were received.\rTree and Landscape Officer: No objection\r\rAssessment\r\rPrinciple of Development \rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. In this case, the application is to vary  planning permission 22/03123/FUL specifically  Condition 1  (plan list)  to capture minor material amendments proposed including  changes to omit the basement from the proposal, revision to the rear terrace, extension of bike store to form plant room and 2 No. additional\rsingle storey sections to the rear.\r\rWhile this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development was nonetheless established by the granting of 22/03123/FUL and Section 73(2) of the Act explicitly states that \"on such an application, the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which permission should be granted\". It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rOfficers are mindful of changes in planning policy circumstances since the granting of the original permission, including the publication updates to the NPPF. Officers have not identified any material changes in site circumstances over the same period.\r\rHaving regard to these changes and the nature of the variations sought under the current application, officers consider that the assessments made under the original application on the following issues remain largely unaltered, subject commentary below :\r -Highways\r- Fire Safety\r\rThe key areas of assessment as part of this S73 proposal are:\r\r- The design of the proposed development; ,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact on trees\r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 207 to 218 of the NPPF (2024) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. When considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal introduces two small  ground floor infill rear extensions to the consented design.  There would no change in the overall  depth and  width of the consented footprint of the building.  The proposed development continues to be considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \rThe site is in a Strategic Area of Special Character, a non designated heritage asset. The proposal is not considered to cause any\rharm to the non designated heritage asset.\r\rTrees: The Tree and Landscape Officer  has confirmed that the proposed modifications are acceptable and the relevant conditions have been updated to reflect the updated arboricultural reports.\r\rResidential Amenity:\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 seeks to safeguard residential amenity with regards to privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed alterations to the consented scheme would would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. It is considered apppropriate to include an additional condition to protect against noise disturbance from the new plant room. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be compliant with  the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and is covered by an area Tree Protection order (TPO). The Coombe Hill Conservation Area encompasses the estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid 19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course. The spacious landscaped setting contributes to the significance of the Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rInstallation of new railing and replacement of hedge, gates and piers to front boundary.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rMalden and Coombe CAAC - Positive support - The proposed new hedges and trees will replace a degraded leylandii hedge and represent a visual improvement to the CA. The railings and piers are in-keeping with the architecture of the newly-built house.\r \rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on Heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on trees; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the The Coombe Hill Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the application proposes to remove an existing hedge and replace this with 2 better quality hedges and 3 new trees. Officers are satisfied that, subject to a condition requiring landscaping be maintained for a period of five years and that any trees or shrubs which die, are removed or become diseased during this period are replaced, the proposed would development would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
