    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "This permission relates to the demolition and erection of a single storey extension only. It does not grant permission for any other works which appear on the drawings.\r\rReason : For the avoidance of doubt",
    "\r\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling and is located within the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area.\r\rThe site is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rThe proposal comprises demolition of the existing rear utility room and WC. Erection of single-storey rear/side extension. Rear dormer roof extension.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation has been received, objecting on the following grounds:\r\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rLoss of light/sunlight \rLoss of outlook \r\rSubsequent to the objection, the proposal has been revised as follows:\r\rThe single storey rear extension has been reduced to 2.95m along the shared boundary with No.27 Victoria Avenue in accordance with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rSurbiton Conservation Areas Advisory Committee: No objection. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the Conservation Area;\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Heritage\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe application site is located within the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area.  Architecturally the area is characterised by consistent purpose-built Edwardian shopping parades along the south and part of the north sides of this road, providing a sense of urbanity and cohesiveness to the area.\r\r\r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would replace an existing window at first floor level and extend across both first and second floor levels. The dormer would mimic the design of the other existing rear dormer in terms of design and width but would be longer which is considered acceptable.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would replace an existing pitched roof rear extension located in the centre of the property. The proposed single storey side and rear extension would have a felted flat roof design. Whilst felt is not a common feature, officers note the extension is to the rear and not visible from the street, and as the roof is flat as opposed to pitched, would not be highly visible to neighbouring properties . Further, no objection has been raised by the Conservation Area Advisory Committee. Although it would exceed the parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, officers note this is limited to only on one side of the extension (the other being no more than 3.5m in depth). It is also noted there are other examples of rear extensions of a similar scale and depth in the vicinity of the application property.\r\rAccess to the rear would be removed, which is discouraged, however waste bin storage is shown alongside the dwelling which is encouraged and provision for cycle parking would be required as a condition with any planning permission.\r\rThe proposal is therefore in accordance with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to consider are Nos.27 and 31 Victoria Avenue.\r\rTo No.27, the proposed single storey rear extension would extend 2.95m (in accordance with the Residential Design SPD) along the shared boundary of an acceptable scale and design. It has also been demonstrated that the proposed extension would not have an adverse impact on sunlight/daylight to this property.\r\rThe existing rear extension at No.31 is a similar structure to the one at the application property and is setback from the boundary with a door to its side elevation. In terms of the  habitable room window on the rear elevation it has been demonstrated there would be no adverse impact in terms of sunlight/daylight.\r\rIt is also acknowledged that the properties along this part of Victoria Avenue benefit from generous rear gardens.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\r\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Acre Road. The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone. \r\rPlanning History\r\r94/1065/FUL - Erection of two storey side extension. Application Granted on 29 Sep 1994. With conditions.\r\r18/12059/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension, increase in height of roof and erection of 5 dormer windows to facilitate loft conversion. Refuse on 21 Mar 2018. Partially allowed and partially upheld on 13 Jul 2018.\r\rThis application (18/12059/HOU) was refused on the grounds that: \r\rThe proposed increase in the roof height would diverge from the established building heights and eaves heights of the gable ended properties on the western side of the street and the addition of dormer windows in the sides of the original roof would add excessive bulk and mass, resulting in an uncomfortable relationship with the host dwelling and neighbouring properties. In combination, these extensions and alterations would be prominent and out of character, resulting in a visually incongruous and jarring appearance from the streetscene, thereby conflicted with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document 2013. \r\rThis application was subsequently appealed, and which resulted in a split decision. The appeal was dismissed insofar as it related to the increase in height of roof and erection of 5 dormer windows to facilitate loft conversion. The appeal was also allowed and planning permission granted insofar as it related to the erection of a single storey rear extension. \r\r18/12293/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension & alterations to existing apertures. Application Granted on 29 May 2018. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and three representations were received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds of:\r- Loss of light\r- Loss of privacy through overlooking.\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings.\r\rThe points raised above are considered material planning concerns and will therefore be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes to raise the overall ridge height of the dwellinghouse by approximately 1.5 metres. Officers note that whilst the proposed new ridge height would be in line with some neighbouring properties, the proposal would also extend the ridge height of the existing two storey side extension. Prior to any development, the original dwellinghouse was a detached dwelling house with a gable ended shallow roof. With the previous two storey side extension, officers consider that the proposed raise in the ridge height of the dwellinghouse would significantly increase the overall scale and visual bulk of the dwellinghouse.  \r\rFurthermore, the application proposes to construct a dormer extension/piggyback extension to the rear of the dwellinghouse. As the proposed raise in ridge height is considered to be unacceptable, the further extension to the developed rear roof slope would add to the visual prominence of the dwellinghouse and is considered to further the unacceptable impact of the proposed development. \r\rIt is considered that the developed dwellinghouse would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene and would represent a cramped form of development which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property. The proposed roof alterations would dominate the original dwellinghouse, which in turn would lose much of its original character as a result of the proposed development. \r\rFinally the application proposes the construction of a flat roof first floor extension to the rear. Whilst the proposed extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, Officers consider the flat roof form of the proposed extension would not relate well to the dwellinghouse. This would also further negatively impact the roofscape of the dwellinghouse, leading to variation of shapes and plans, which would be uncharacteristic of the area. \r\rAs such it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Due to the siting of the proposed development, in comparison with neighbouring properties and their extensions, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a significant loss of light to any neighbouring properties. Furthermore, whilst it is considered that the proposal would lead to a cramped form of the development, again due to the relationship of the application site to its neighbouring properties, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an overbearing appearance. \r\rFinally, in relation to privacy, whilst the proposal would result in the introduction of a juliet balcony and a window on the developed rear elevation at second floor level, due to their distance from neighbouring properties, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a significant loss of privacy. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey semi-detached property.  The existing property is not listed and the site is not loacted within a conservation area.\r\rProposal\rErection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation \r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No responses have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear dormer would not be visible from the street scene and the design pays attention to existing windows and generally follows their form.  Although the proposed development would not be set down by 500mm from the ridge or up from the eaves by 500mm, it would be set in from the sides by more than 500mm and therefore appear subordinate and proportionate. The proposed rear dormer would not be entirely uncommon within the wider area. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 4 representations have been received, relating to:\r\r- Excessive bulk or height of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and, \r- The impact of the development on protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would relate well to the host property and its existing roof form and would not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof. Officers note that the rear extension would not be highly visible from the streetscene and the use of matching materials would prevent a stark difference from the host dwelling. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement with a new window however, the proposed front elevation window would be in keeping with the fenestration pattern of the main dwelling and the surrounding locality which would adequately integrate into the streetscene. It is considered the conversion would not cause a significant negative impact on the streetscene of Cotswold Close.\r\rWith regards to the proposed alteration to the bay window, front porch canopy and the proposed raised roof to side extension, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would maintain adequate separation distances between neighbouring properties as it would be above the existing rear extension which sits at a distance of 6m away from neighbouring property No.2 Cotswold Close and over 12m away from neighbouring property No.4 Fairlawn Close. Although the additional first floor side elevation window would face towards neighbouring property No. 2 Cotswold Close, a condition has been imposed for obscured glazing to mitigate any significant privacy loss. \r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rules and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The dimensions of the existing garage would safely accommodate on-site car parking and would provide cycle parking compyling with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. However, it is noted that the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide 2 adequate car parking spaces, which would be acceptable levels of on-site car parking. The loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted for approval.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD and would be in keeping with host property and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) states that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: While no arboricultural information has been submitted, it is noted that the proposed extension would be built within the existing footprint of the development. Therefore the proposed development would not result in any direct adverse impact on protected trees on site.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
