    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located on the corner plot of Woodlands Avenue and Branksome Way. The site falls within the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \rErection of a first floor side extension.\rThe current application relates to the planning application ref. no 22/02561/HOU for erection of a first floor side extension refused due to the proposed, flat roof form. \r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the scale, siting and design of the proposed first floor extension, it is considered that it would appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As such there would be no unacceptable impact on the existing street scene as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: To protect amenities of the occupiers at No 43 Woodlands Avenue, the proposed window to the south elevation shall be obscure glazed and non openable below 1.7m when measured from the floor level, details of which would be secured via condition. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling located on Westbury Road.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey rear extension, front porch extension (to provide wheelchair access) and conversion of garage into a habitable room (As details previously approved 19.03.2020 - 20/00138/HOU)\r\rRelevant planning history:\r20/00138/HOU Erection of a single storey rear extension, front porch extension (to provide wheelchair access) and conversion of garage into a habitable room granted on 19.03.2020.\r\r17/14259/HOU Erection of single storey rear extension, conversion of garage to living accommodation with associated elevational alterations granted on 18.05.2017. \r\r17/14582/HOU Erection of single storey front porch granted on 03.08.2017. \r\rConsultations\r12 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Loss of Car Parking; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed conversion of the garage into habitable room and the front porch extension are considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and immediate surrounding area. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension (4m deep) would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth which are in this case up to 3.5m. However, considering the size of the plot and the existing extension at the neighbouring property the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of its scale, mass and bulk and the proposed design. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that the proposed extension would fail the 45 degree test in terms of daylight/sunlight in relation to the patio doors at No 53A Westbury Road. However, given that the proposed extension would be located immediately to the north of this window, it is unlikely to have a materially harmful impact on the room it serves. \r\rFurthermore,  it is a material consideration that there is an extant permission on the site ref. no 20/00138/HOU for a similar proposal which could still be implemented. Therefore, officers consider that it would be unreasonable to resist the development on these grounds. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Westbury Road.  \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "ikThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would have a depth that is in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however the proposed extension would have an appropriate roof form and modest height and as such would appear a subordinate addition to the host property.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed first floor side extension and side and rear dormers would not strictly adhere to the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of roof form and set in from the eaves, however it is noted that these extensions have been approved via planning permission ref: 19/02178/HOU. As such, since there has been no change in the scale or design of these extensions, Officers consider this aspect of the proposal acceptable given that the previously approved application would be given material consideration in the assessment of this application. \r\rThe proposed single storey front porch is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed extensions would have a greater depth closer to the shared boundary with 55 Nelson Road, however it is noted that this neighbouring property benefits from an existing ground floor extension, and given that a separation distance is maintained between the shared boundary it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of  55 Nelson Road by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rGiven the separation distance between the proposed development and 51 Nelson Road,  it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of 51 Nelson Road by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rOfficers note that openings are proposed in the side elevations at first and second floor level, therefore to mitigate against any loss of privacy for the occupants of neighbouring properties, a condition to ensure these openings are obscure glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above FFL will be imposed.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would include an integral garage, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would not be wide enough to comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision. Despite the fact that the proposed development would not result in any loss or gain of off-street parking on site, the existing on-site provision (1 space) on the hardstanding to the front of the garage would accord with London Plan standards.\r\rOfficers note that whilst the proposed garage would not be appropriate for parking cars, it would be appropriate in accommodating on-site cycle parking in accordance with the standards set out in Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

Ensuring that any potential future modifications to the building will take into account and not compromise the base build fire safety/ protection measures.\r \rThe development shall be implemented in accordance with the approved Fire Statement and retained as such for the lifetime of the development.\r \rReason: In order to achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure the safety of all building users.\r \r54.B states: Prior to commencement for each building details shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority demonstrating that a minimum of at least one lift per core (or more subject to capacity assessments) will be a suitably sized fire evacuation lift suitable to be used to evacuate people who require level access from the building. The development shall be carried out in accordance with these details and maintained as such in perpetuity.\r \rReason: In the interests of fire safety.\r\rOfficer response: It is noted that the Health and Safety Executive consultee is satisfied with the submitted information to the extent that it affects land use planning. As such, the conditions 54.A  (Fire Strategy) and 54.B (evacuation lift) in relation to Plot B Phase 1 is hereby approved.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rProposal\rProposed creation of new basement level with front and side lightwells and front boundary alterations.\r\rPlanning History\r22/01888/HOU - Construction of a basement extension with formation of 1 x front and 1 x side lightwells. Refused planning permission, dated 8 August 2022 for the following reason:\r\r(1)\tThe applicant in the absence of submitting a Basement Impact Assessment has failed to demonstrate that the proposed basement would not result in harm to land stability and/or groundwater flow and, as such, the proposal would not accord with National Planning Practice Guidance and policies DM4 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rConsultation\rNo response received to neighbour notification/site and press notice.\rKingston Town CAAC: No comments received.\rHistoric England GLASS: No further conditions or investigations necessary. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon character and appearance (including heritage assets); \r- The impact upon the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- Basement development\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance (including Heritage Assets)\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. At street level, the proposed development would be minimal in terms of its visual impact, with black steel grates with central clear glazing proposed flush to the ground within the front garden/driveway area. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts upon the character or appearance of the area or harm to the character and appearance of the Knights Park/Fairfield Conservation Area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rBasement Development\rParagraph 170 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by preventing new and existing development from contributing to, being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by land instability.\r\rParagraph 178 of the NPPF 2021 goes on to say that planning decisions should ensure that a site is suitable for its proposed use, taking account of ground conditions and any risks arising from land instability. This includes risks arising from natural hazards or former activities such as mining, and any proposals for mitigation including land remediation (as well as potential impacts on the natural environment arising from that remediation).\r\rHowever, Paragraph 179 makes clear that where a site is affected by land stability issues, responsibility for securing a safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a basement construction and methodology statement, which specifically considers the impact of the proposed basement on groundwater, in support of the application. Officers are satisfied that the report is authored by a suitably qualified consultant.\r\rThe borehole has encountered Made Ground (thickness 0.7m) overlying initially loose becoming medium dense to dense (very dense in places) sands and gravels, proven to a maximum depth of 6.0mbgl. Groundwater was encountered at 4.3m depth.\r\rThe BIA does not identify any significant impacts from surface water or existing drainage. Similarly, the BIA does not identify any significant impacts from groundwater.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\rAccordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed two storey side extension would be set down from the ridge of the original roof slope, and set back at first floor level, it is noted that it would not have an adequate separation distance between the shared boundary, and given that the proposal would also have a gable end, it is considered that this would add additional bulk to the proposed extension, which would significantly reduce the characteristic openness between the dwellings, and would ultimately detract from the prevailing pattern of development within the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension on the existing hipped roof would result in an awkward and bulky roof form, given that it would not adequately be set in from the eaves or sides of the roof slope and down from the ridge, it would detract from the character of the original dwelling. Further, in combination with the proposed two storey side extension, officers consider that the proposed rear dormer with two storey side extension would combine to create an awkward and incongruous addition to the host property, which would detract from the established character of the immediate surrounding area. It is also noted that the proposed juliette balcony would be oversized for the scale of the proposed dormer, and given the height and prominence of the extension, it would visually detract from the appearance of the original dwelling. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed extensions would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that the proposals would not extend further in depth, and neighbouring properties do not benefit from side facing windows, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would demolish the existing garage, however Officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would not be wide enough to comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision. \r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage, the provided plans show that a bin and bike store would be located to the front of the site, and officers consider this would be an appropriate location for dedicated cycle parking.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "\rApplication Site\rThe application site is in Pine Gardens and comprises of a two-storey, a detached residential dwellinghouse. There is provision for off street parking on site and garden space the rear.\r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character. The site is not listed or locally listed and does not fall within a Conservation Area. Neither does it have any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on the site or in the immediate vicinity, or fall within a Flood Risk Zone. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the conversion of the garage into habitable space, erection of single storey front/ side extension and alteration to fenestration.\rConsultation\r8no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; \r- The impact upon highways; and\r- Fire safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 38 (Front Extensions) of the SPD guidance is applicable to this application. Policy Guidance 38 of the Residential Design SPD advises n designing a front extension the following guidance will apply: Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation. The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house. All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties. Front extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported. Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rThe extensions would facilitate the proposed conversion of the garage as shown on the submitted plans as being given over to habitable accommodation in the form of an extension to a utility room, a pantry and a cloak room.\rIt is considered that the proposed development would preserve and maintain the character of the area and would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property, in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOverall and in terms of residential amenity the proposal is considered to comply with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rHighway Safety\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe site is within PTAL 1B. London Plan Policy T6.1 seeks to ensure a maximum of 1.5 spaces per 3+ dwelling. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the attached garage space. The area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used for parking of a car, and so the subject site can still accomodate a space which woudl comply with the LP.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rThe  proposals are considered to relate well to the original dwelling, would be subordinate in scale and would not have an unacceptably adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity, thereby complying with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design Guide, 2013.\r\rThe scheme is therefore considered to be acceptable and in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that retrospective planning permission should be granted\r",
    "Condition 58 (Hoarding Strategy) of planning permission 20/02942/FUL states:\rNo development within a Development Plot or Phase, shall commence until a scheme for temporary fencing and/or enclosure of the site (a Hoarding Strategy) has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, and the temporary fencing and/or enclosure has been erected in accordance with the approved details.

    "The site is occupied by a two storey terraced building, located on the eastern side of Mill Street.\r\rThe property is located within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area and Flood Risk Area Zone 2. \r\rPlanning permission is sought for Demolition of existing rear extension and erection of single-storey rear extension.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No representations have been received.\r\rHistoric England: Consultation not considered necessary.\r\rKingston Town Conservation Areas Advisory Committee: No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the Conservation Area;\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Heritage\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe application site is located within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: An early suburb of Kingston Town Centre comprising houses of various sizes and designs dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855. In 1850 this conservation area was farmland and open meadows until Victorian villas were built on Orchard Road in 1860. \r\rOfficers note the Conservation Area is very mixed comprising many historic and visually pleasing buildings however there are also a number of other buildings in the immediate vicinity with no historic or visual merit. The site is located adjacent to the Knights Park campus for Kingston University. The existing extension is currently inadequate habitable accommodation and makes no provision for open space. The proposed development has been designed to be sympathetic to the host dwelling, and is modest in scale and design allowing some open space to the rear of the property. It would not be visible from the street. Officers therefore do not consider the proposal would result in harm to the Conservation Area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would replace an existing extension that does not provide a satisfactory standard of habitable space. The extension would be 1.5m depth with a slate pitched roof, providing a new kitchen/dining space and create a new outdoor space which the existing extension prevents. Provision for bike storage has also been made at the rear in the absence of a front garden to accommodate otherwise.  The extension would be finished externally in brickwork to match the existing. No objection is proposed to the modest rooflight.\r \rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would increase the open space to the rear , is modest in scale and design, and has been designed to respect the character of the host dwelling and surrounding properties, opening up the open space to the rear and improving the overall outlook for the host and neighbouring properties.\r \rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposed development would not unduly\rimpact the amenities of neighbouring properties.\r\r\rFlood Risk\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: As set out above, the application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rA flood risk assessment has been submitted detailing flood protection measures in accordance with the standing advice to ensure the proposal will be safe in terms of flood risk and will not increase the risk of flood elsewhere. As such, the proposed development is considered not to conflict with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r\r\r",
