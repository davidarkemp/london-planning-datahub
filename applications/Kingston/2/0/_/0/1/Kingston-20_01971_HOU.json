    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used for a purpose ancillary or incidental or both to the residential use of the dwelling house currently known as 64 Barrons Chase unless otherwise first agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure the property remains in single occupation and to protect the amenities of neighbours in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012)",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a three storey mid terrace building located on the west side of Market Place. \r\rThe site contains a Grade II Listed Building and is located within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The site also falls within the Kingston Town Centre Area of Archaeological Significance and Flood Risk Zone 2. \r\rProposal\rInstallation of 3no. replacement non-illuminated individual letter fascia signs and 2no. replacement non-illuminated projecting signs. \r\rConsultations \rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objection\r\r31 adjoining properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the proposal on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the proposal on neighbouring residential amenity; and,\r- The impact of the proposal on highway safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal is considered to be of an appropriate design and scale for this premises and would not significantly harm the character and appearance of Grade II Listed building (6-9 Market Place), but rather preserve it, as the proposed replacement signs are similar to the existing ones.  As such it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rOfficer Comment: The site is located within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and involves the Grade II Listed building, 6-9 Market Place. However, and as stated above, Officers consider that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposal.  It follows that the proposal  would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and would not result in any harm to the significance of heritage assets.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed signage would appear subordinate additions to the streetscene and given that they would be adequately spaced out along the streetscene, would not lead to a proliferation of signage or a visual intrusion in the streetscene. The signage would not detract from the amenity of the surrounding area or result in any material harm to nearby neighbouring residential occupiers.\r\rHighways\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion, on street car parking pressure, or compromise pedestrian or highway safety. \r  \rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the non-illuminated proposals would not be significantly different from the existing situation and would therefore have no adverse impact upon highways and transportation, thereby complying with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
