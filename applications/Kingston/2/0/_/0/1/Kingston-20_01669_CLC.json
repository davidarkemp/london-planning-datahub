    "The validation checklist has 'N' in biodiversity checklist, fire statement and time stamp photo, since we have received those documents, please revise Validation Checklist with updated information.\rThe new Validation Local List and Checklist can be found on the council's website: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/download/261/validation-requirements-for-planning-applications\r",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is located on designated Green Belt land at the south eastern end of the Chessington World of Adventures site.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r24/02014/TEL Installation of 25m high lattice mast to accommodate 6 no. Antenna, 15 no. RRU and 2 no. 0.3m dishes on new concrete base along with 4 no. equipment cabinets and 1 no. GPS module within 2.4m high fenced compound along with ancillary development thereto - Prior Approval Refused on 07.10.2024 due to the following reason:\r\r1. The proposed siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location as it would both constitute inappropriate development in the Green Belt and create an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views and internal views of the site detracting from the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would not accord with paragraphs 152 - 156 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2023 and policies G2 of the London Plan and CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rConsultations\rExolum Pipeline System - objects to the proposal\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of 25m high lattice mast to accommodate 6 no. Antenna, 15 no. RRU and 2 no. 0.3m dishes on new concrete base along with 4 no. equipment cabinets and 1 no. GPS module within 2.4m high fenced compound along with ancillary development thereto. \r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended on the basis of its siting and appearance, taking into account any representations received. \r\rThe only considerations are:\r\r-Siting\r-Appearance\r\rSiting\rThe proposal would be located on designated Green Belt land at the south eastern end of the Chessington World of Adventures. \r\rIt is noted that, as per submitted covering letter and the application form, the temporary mast approximately 24m high at the adjoining Chessington Garden Centre would be removed and replaced by the proposal, however no details have been submitted regarding its removal or how its removal would be secured.\r\rThe applicant has submitted photomontages to demonstrate / articulate the impact of the proposal on the surrounding area (this information was not submitted with the previous application). \r\rWhilst it is acknowledged that the proposed 25m mast with the antennas attached to the top would be visible from the surrounding area, it would be partially obscured by the surrounding mature trees.  The proposal would be sited among the mature trees within a mostly rural area approximately 88m to Leatherhead Road and approximately 504m to nearest dwellings along junction Fairoak Lane, Rushett Lane and Leatherhead Road. \r\rThe proposal would also be located close to the car parking area for Chessington World of Adventure and the existing tall structures at this site.\r\rThe proposal would be sited in close proximity to the existing high-pressure oil pipeline apparatus. \r\rOfficers note the following objections received from Exolum Pipeline System with regards to the proposed siting of the mast in relation to the existing high-pressure oil pipeline apparatus:\r\r- The application has the potential to contravene Exolum's ability to Safely access and maintain its assets under their legal rights as set out in Part IV of The Energy Act 2013, and\r- Due to the potential for breach(s) of the Health & Safety at Work Act 1974 with specific concerns around Regulation 15 of the Pipeline Safety Regulations 1996 and the potential for any subsequent  work close to the High-Pressure Pipeline to impact both the Safety of the pipeline and those doing the work.\r\rIn absence of any robust evidence  to the contrary and following the above objection, Officers raise concerns that the proposed siting of the mast could have a detrimental impact on the pipeline which in turn could raise safety concerns. \r\rAppearance\rThe proposed approximately 25m lattice mast in 6009 RAL would be attached to a concrete base (approximately 5.3m x 5.3m) and secured with a 2.4m high palisade fence. \r\r6 no. antennas and 2 no. 0.3m dishes would be installed to the top of the mast. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the top of the mast with the antennas would be visible above the existing trees, however due to its siting, the proposed scale and proximity to the Cheesington World of Adventure and its high structures, the proposal is not considered to appear as intrusive or overbearing. \r\rWith regards to the impact of the proposal on the Green Belt, it is noted that, according to Paragraphs 120 - 121 of The National Planning Policy Framework 2024, the provision of telecommunication mast should not be banned from a certain areas subject to its appearance and siting. \r\rSchedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 does not preclude such a proposal from the Green Belt areas subject to its appearance and siting.\r\rGiven the above and based on the additional information submitted by the applicant the proposed appearance of the mast, in isolation, would be in-keeping with the surrounding area and therefore it would not adversely affect the openness of the Green Belt. \r\rHowever, considering no details have been submitted in relation to the removal of the existing 24m mast and associated equipment at the adjoining Chessington Garden Centre, the proposal could result in a proliferation of such infrastructure that would have a cumulative detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area and the Green Belt. \r\rConclusion\rNo evidence has been submitted to demonstrate no adverse impact on the existing high-pressure oil pipeline apparatus. Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed siting would be appropriate and that it would not raise safety concerns. As such the proposal is considered to be contrary to Paragraph 122 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024 and Schedule 2 Part 16 of Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)\r\rFurthermore, no details have been submitted with regards to the proposed removal of the existing mast and the associated equipment at the adjoining Chessington Garden Centre. As such, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not result in a proliferation of such infrastructure that would have a cumulative detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area and the Green Belt, contrary to Paragraphs 120 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2024, Policies G2 of the London Plan and CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r"
