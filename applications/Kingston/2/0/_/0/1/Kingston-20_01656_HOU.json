    "The use of zinc in the external finishes of the proposed development would be at odds with and would not be sympathetic to the architectural style and appearance of the host property and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area and therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed single storey side extension by virtue of its depth, siting and design would create an incogruous addition to the host property that would not be in keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the area and therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "By reason of its excessive depth along the shared boundary the proposed side extension element of the proposals would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of adjoining property, No. 91 Knightwood Crescent in terms of overbearing appearance, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012)",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultants and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 7 (Fire Safety Statement) of planning permission 22/01522/FUL, which states:\r\rCondition 7 (Fire Safety Statement) - Prior to any above ground works of the development to which this permission relates a Fire Safety Strategy shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details: \r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \r\rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained. \r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "The National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it.\rThe proposal is for changes to the details and the number of cycle facilities, involving a reduction of 46 cycle parking spaces (comprising 12 short stay Sheffield stands and 32 long stay spaces), the changes to the cycle parking provision and associated alterations are materially different from the original scheme. The alterations are considered to be a minor material alteration. \r\rGeneral Comments: \rIt is considered that should you wish to pursue a Section 73 application for the proposed changes, the appliction would need to be fully justified, including an update to the Transport Assessment, together with  plans to clearly identify the proposed changes.\r",
    "Condition 6 (Secure Cycle Parking) of planning permission 22/01319/HOU states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of any development above ground level, details of secure cycle parking facilities to serve the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport are taken up, in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rPolicy Guidance 20 of the Residential Design SPD states:\r\rWhere cycle storage needs to be provided externally it should be constructed from durable materials appropriate to their setting. Where possible these:\r- Should be low maintenance and designed to wear should be sited sensitively be well screened and appropriately landscaped so as to preserve and enhance the character of the streetscene; and,\r- Should not project forward of the established building line.\r\rThe proposed location of the cycle storage would not be appropriately landscaped/sited and it would project forward an substantial amount of the established building line, failing to comply with the Residential Design SPD.",
    "I acknowledge receipt of your payment for £3,744, however, the fee required for this application would be double as both a meeting and written advice note has been selected. I have applied a small discount so please forward the outstanding balance of £3,256 as soon as possible.\r\rNote: Payment can be made online via the Kingston council website, via our Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002, or by cheque made payable to Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames",
