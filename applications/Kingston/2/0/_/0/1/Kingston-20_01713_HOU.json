    "The proposed extension, by reason of its excessive width, would fail to appear subordinate to the host dwelling and would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a flat located within a semi detached, three storey Victorian property with a basement.\r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character, although the site is in close proximity to St.Andrew's Church.\r\rThe site is not listed but is locally listed as a Building of Townscape Merit and is located within the St. Andrew's Square Conservation Area. \r\rRelevant Planning History:\r11/16324/HOU - Erection of external platform (balcony) with stairs to the rear garden  to Flat C 50 Maple Road - refused on 07.09.2011 due to the unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers of Flat D 50 Maple Road, appeal ref no APP/Z5630/A/11/2163168/NWF dismissed on 12.01.2012\r\r31506 - 50 Maple Road Surbiton - Formation of rear balcony and fire escape ladder with lean to canopy - granted on 03.10.1986. \r\rProposal \rErection of external balcony to rear elevation.\r\rConsultations\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee - no comment/neutral as the proposal would not be visible within the existing street view.\r\r38 properties were notified of the proposal. \rOne representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inappropriate design/layout (scale and dominance)\r- Loss of sunlight\r- Noise and disturbance\r- Overlooking/ loss of privacy\rThe above raised concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the  St. Andrew's Square Conservation Area and the locally listed building; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed balcony would be contained within the existing framework that supports the balcony/platform to the first floor flat (Flat B). The proposed design and materials would be similar to the existing ones. As such, it is considered that the proposal due to its scale and nature would be in-keeping with the existing development and the host dwelling and therefore would be acceptable from the design point of view. \r\rThe proposed balcony would not be visible within the street view, therefore there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene and the surrounding area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as; An area of Victorian housing dating from the 1860s - 1880s, in Gothic and Classical styles, including a garden square unique to South West London. It forms a later phase of the Surbiton \"New Town\" begun in 1838 by Thomas Pooley.\r\rAs the proposal would not be visible from the public vantage points and due to its modest scale, the proposed design and materials and the existing stracture, it is considered that the proposed balcony would be in-keeping with the host dwelling, therefore the proposed development would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application site is locally listed as a Building of Townscape Merit which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the conservation area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the  locally listed  building.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe main property that would be affected by the proposal is Flat D (a basement flat). The proposed balcony due to its siting and size would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the principle windows of Flat D (the bedroom and living room). \r\rOfficers note the existing ground level and planting as well as the small size of the windows to the rear elevation of Flat D that affect the amount of daylight received by this flat. The proposed balcony (approximately 1.3m deep and 3.5m wide and located less than 0.5m above the top of windows to Flat D) would effectively create a cover that would further reduce the amount of daylight for that flat located within the basement level. It is noted that no additional information was submitted to demonstrate no significant loss of daylight in relation to the Flat D. Officers note reason for refusal for the previous, similar scheme ref no 11/16324/HOU and the decision notice for the dismissed appeal ref no APP/Z5630/A/11/2163168/NWF. \r\rFurthermore, given the siting of the proposed balcony and how close it would be situated to the windows of the Flat D, it is considered that the proposal would appear as overbearing in relation to Flat D when viewed from the rear garden. \r\rDue to the siting of the balcony in relation to habitable windows at Flat D, it is considered that the proposal would result in increased level of noise and disturbance and therefore would likely cause material harm to the living conditions of the occupiers of the adjoining flat D. \r\rWith regards to the potential overlooking or loss of privacy, given the siting and scale of the balcony as well as the angles, there would be no unacceptable overlooking or loss of privacy in relation to the flat D. \r\rAs such it is considered that the proposal by reason of its siting in relation to the adjoining, habitable windows at Flat D would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of occupiers at Flat D in terms of loss of daylight, overbearing impact and  level of noise and disturbance, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r"
