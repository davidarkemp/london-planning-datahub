    "By virtue of its height, mass and bulk, the proposed mansard and dormer roof extensions would result in an incongruous form of development that would fail to respect the architectural integrity of the host dwellings. The proposed development would unbalance the symmetry between terrace properties  at numbers 49 to 54 Cleaveland Road, and  would appear visually intrusive in the street scene and within the wider area, which is designated as a 'Local Area of Special Character'. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 26 and 39 of the adopted Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development; and, \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Note: The application includes the erection of a part single, double-storey side extension. It is stated in Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD, that two-storey and first floor side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. With the exception of the conversion of an existing garage into habitable space, the demolition of an existing conservatory and erection of a part two storey/part single storey extension and dormer roof extension, would be to the rear of the property. Taking this into account, officers consider the proposed development, would have no detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the streetscene, host property, or the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers Note: The proposed development will extend no further than the furthest projecting rear wall of no.3 Grosvenor Gardens and only slightly further than the rear wall of no.7 Grosvenor Gardens. For these reasons, no significant increase in the loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to either of the adjoining properties in Grosvenor Gardens. The proposed rear roof dormer, would cause a slight loss of privacy to neighbouring properties. However the loss caused, would not be significant enough to warrant refusal.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the conversion of a garage into habitable space. However, the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate one spaces for on-site parking. The PTAL for this part of Grosvenor Gardens, is 1b. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1.5 spaces per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 1 to 2, 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "In order to meet our plan requirements please add North Points to the following plans:\r\rA109 Site Location Plan\rExisting Floor and Roof Plans\rProposed Floor and Roof Plans\r\rWe have also given your application a more concise proposal description as above. Please let us know if you would like this to be changed, otherwise we will use this on all records for this application."
