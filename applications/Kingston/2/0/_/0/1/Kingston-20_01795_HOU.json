    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the north-western flank elevation of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the window at first floor level in the south-eastern flank elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end terrace dwelling located on Gilders Road.\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of garage and erection of two storey side extension.\r\rConsultations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would not be set back from the front elevation by the recommended distance (500mm). It is also noted that the proposed width of the extension slightly exceeds 50% of the width of the original house. \r\rHowever, considering that the proposed roof would be significantly set back from the existing roof line and its proposed design as well as separation distance of approximately 2.6m to the common boundary with No 151A, the proposed side extension would appear proportionate and subordinate in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rOfficers note existing similar two storey side extension (with no set-back from the front elevation) within Gilders Road, therefore the proposed development would not have significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers note the proposed raised patio area, in order to ensure no adverse impact on the amenities of the occupiers at No 155, a privacy screening installed along the south boundary would be secured via condition. \r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Gilders Road. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy Plan 153-GR-PL-06  which is considered to be sufficient. \r\rThe development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the Fire Safety Strategy Plan hereby approved and and thereafter maintained.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Security and Public Safety  \r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed first-floor extension would not maintain a 1m distance from the boundary, however, the potential creation of a terraced appearance would not occur, as the boundary is not shared with a neighbouring property, but rather a public footpath. Additionally, the proposed drawings demonstrate an approximate 3m set down from the roofline and the maintenance of the 1.2m distance from the front of the house, falling in line with the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 36. In order to preserve the appearance within Burton Road, a condition requiring matching material will be imposed.\r\rTherefore, on balance, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first-floor side extension would be located on the north-facing flank of the dwelling, on a boundary shared with a public footpath, No. 26 Archer Close similarly shares the footpath and would be in close proximity to the proposed development. However, the development would be set down from the roofline and set in from the rear wall of the dwelling, therefore the proposal would not cause further harm to the sunlight/daylight of No.26 Archer Close. An assessment of the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the extension has been conducted, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposal includes provisions of a window facing No. 26 Archer Close, an obscurity condition, which must meet level 3 standards has been applied to mitigate the loss of privacy.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSecure by Design \rPolicy D11 of the London Plan requires all developments design out crime, to maintain a secure and safe environment that reduces the fear of crime. \r\rAs mentioned above, the boundary is shared with a public footpath (maintained by the council), whilst officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would slightly hinder the splay of light coming from the streetlight located outside No.56 Burton Road, it would not affect the light provided by the streetlight located on the alleyway. Therefore, there would not be any significant harm to the security or safety of the public, as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Officer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
