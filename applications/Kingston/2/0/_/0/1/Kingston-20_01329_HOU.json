    "The proposed roof extensions, by reason of the pitch of the roof and the siting and dimensions of the dormers, would appear as highly prominent, unduly dominant and incongruous features within the Culsac Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
