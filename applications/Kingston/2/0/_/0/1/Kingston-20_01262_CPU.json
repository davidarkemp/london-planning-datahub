    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered not to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a three-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse which has been converted into three residential flats located on Manorgate Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r20/03183/FUL - Proposed single storey side and rear extension and additional fenestration to facilitate conversion of 1 bed flat to 2 bed flat. Application Granted on 16 Apr 2021. With conditions.\r\r20/02415/FUL - Erection of single storey side/rear extension to ground floor flat, 2 no. additional windows to side elevation and provision of vehicular access (dropped kerb). Refuse on 23 Nov 2020. With conditions.\r\r14/12042/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension. Application Granted on 28 Mar 2014. With conditions.\r\r28910 - Retention of one flat and one maisonette. Application Granted on 22 Oct 1984\r\rConsultations\r\r33 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer - No objection. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principle of removing the front wall and landscaping the front garden to create a hardstanding suitable for car parking would not be harmful in terms of character and appearance. It is noted that neighbouring properties have undertaken similar development in the street. As such the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes two parking spaces in the front garden area of the application site. These vehicular spaces meet the required minimum dimensions of 2.4 metres in width by 4.8 metres in depth as outlined in the Sustainable Transport SPD. The application would increase on site parking by 2 spaces. As there are three individual flats within the application site Officers consider this level of parking appropriate to the site. \r\rFurthermore, the application has been reviewed by the Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer who raised no objection and did not raise any highway concerns. The provision of a new crossover would be precluded by the existence of an established street tree to the front of the property. However, the Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has confirmed that they are satisfied that the lowered kerb is suitable for vehicles to traverse without further modification. The applicant is advised that adequate forward visibility is maintained. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on highway safety and congestion. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
