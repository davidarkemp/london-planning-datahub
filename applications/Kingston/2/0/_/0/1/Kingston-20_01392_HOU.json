Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. The referenced windows are as follows: \ra) The first floor window fitted in the front elevation serving the room labelled as \"ensuite\" on drawing number 01 Proposed First Floor Plan \rb) The first floor windows fitted in the rear elevation serving the rooms labelled \"bathroom\" and \"ensuite\" on drawing number 01 Proposed First Floor Plan\rAny film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Condition 5  (Arboricultural)  - RBK Tree and Landscape Officer has reviewed the infomation submitted and is now satisfied this can be approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 5  (Arboricultural) of planning permission 22/00280/HOU is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the\rdecision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the\rapplication site and its planning history, the relevant legislation and guidance, considered any\rrelevant case law, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such\ras consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling adjacent to Southborough Conservation Area and St. Matthews Avenue Local Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for conversion of the existing garage to a habitable room including alterations to the roof, insertion of 1no rooflight and associated changes to fenestration. \r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r  \rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee - no objections subject to the proposed windows matching the existing ones in terms of style and materials. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed new flat roof would feature a roof lantern and would be of the total height of approximately 2.9m. Considering that the proposed materials would match the existing ones in terms of appearance and quality, the proposed conversion of garage, the new roof form and associated changes to fenestration would be acceptable in terms of scale, form and design and they would relate well to the host dwelling. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the existing street scene and the surrounding area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, which reflects the existing situation. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, officers note that access to the garden will remain so it is possible for secure cycle parking to be provided in the garden despite the loss of possible storage within the existing garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
