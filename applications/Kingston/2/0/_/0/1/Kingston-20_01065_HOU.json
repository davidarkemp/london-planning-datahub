    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the northern and southern elevations wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a mid-terrace dwelling located on Elton Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rRelevant History\r\r21/02292/HOU - Erection of single storey-rear/side extension. Refuse on 09 Sep 2021. Reason for refusal: The excessive depth of the proposed ground floor side/rear extension, combined with its height and siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 37 Elton Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room at No. 37 Elton Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConsultations\r\r21 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and comments have been received from one party OBJECTING to the application on the grounds that: \r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Fumes\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosur\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Storage of hazardous substances\r- Support\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe points raised as part of this objection in relation to the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area, as well as the amenity of neighbouring properties are material planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this application.  \r\rDue to the scale of the proposed development, officers consider it unlikely that in the event of an approval, the construction of the proposed development would significantly impact neighbouring properties through the creation of dust and waste. Similarly, the impact the proposal would have on parking in the area would likely be limited. Nevertheless, in the event of an approval, informatives would be attached to the decision notice detailing the limited times allowed for construction, and advising the applicant that the Council has formal powers to control noise and nuisance under relevant legislation. \r\rFurthermore there is no evidence to suggest that the proposed development would lead to any compounding of issues related to drainage, both foul and clean water. As such officers do not consider it necessary to discuss this issue within the consideration of this application. Additionally, the objector is advised that the potential impacts of the proposed development on drainage issues will be considered as part of the investigations carried out by Building Control in the post planning stage of the development. \r\rAdditionally, the points raised regarding the removal of the boundary fence would be considered a Party Wall issue. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the proposed single storey side/rear extension would not strictly adhere to the guidance of the Residential Design SPD, extending approximately 7.1 metres beyond the rear wall of the existing dwellinghouse, given the existing extensions to the dwellinghouse and similar extensions at neighbouring properties, Officers consider that the proposed would not be an uncharacteristic form of development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to Amenity are Nos. 37 and 41 Elton Road. In relation to No. 39 Elton Road, after the previous reasons for refusal of (21/02292/HOU), the proposed development is now set in from the boundary as well as reduced in height on the boundary with this neighbouring property. Officers therefore consider that the proposed development would no longer result in an undue sense of enclosure or overbearing impact to this neighbouring property. Similarly, the applicant has clearly indicated that the proposed development would not result in a significant loss of sunlight to the closest habitable room window at No. 37 Elton Road, in line with Policy Guidance 17 of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, the proposed development would not result in a loss of privacy through overlooking to No. 37 Elton Road. \r\rIn relation to No. 41 Elton Road, as this neighbouring property benefits from a similarly designed extension as the proposed, and no windows are proposed facing this property it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
