    "Consultations\r8no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\rNo planning history recorded.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of existing garage into habitable room with associated changes to fenestration.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey detached dwellinghouse. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprise of predominantly detached and semi-detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r-\tThe Impact upon Highways; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals seek to convert the integral garage into a habitable room with associated change from existing garage door to a window of a similar appearance to the existing main windows within the front elevation of the property. This is considered to be an acceptable alteration which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe conversion of the garage and alterations to the fenestration would not cause any materially harmful impacts to neighbouring amenity. There are no side-facing windows proposed.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space, although based on the existing floor plan, it does not appear to be of a size capable of fitting a modern car. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the conversion would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rAccess to the rear garden would be maintained to secure access to secure cycle parking.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered not to result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. In addition adequate car parking space for the property would be retained, to the satisfaction of the Council.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",
