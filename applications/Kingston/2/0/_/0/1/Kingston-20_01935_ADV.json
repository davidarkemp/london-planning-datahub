    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey end of terrace building located on the south side of Coombe Road. The application relates specifically to the area to the front of the ground floor unit. The site does not contain a Listed Building and is not located within a Conservation Area but does fall within the Coombe Road Local Centre.\r\rProposal\rErection of wooden deck and installation of pergola to front and side of restaurant.\r\rIt is noted that planning permission for the erection of wooden deck to front and side of restaurant and cafe shop to replace existing outdoor seating arrangement has been approved under 22/01165/FUL dated 14.07.2022\r\rThe proposed plans do not show any changes to the layout of the decking with regards to floorspace.\r\rConsultation\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer - Comments have not been received in relation to this application but it is noted that the following comments were received in relation to the permitted decking in the previous application and would still be relevant: -No objections on grounds of highway safety. The applicant should not affix anything to the decking fence which would increase its overall height and impact upon drivers' visibility.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on Highway Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed elevations and roof plan show what appears to be a tiled roof. This has not been mentioned within the description of development or listed under materials on the application form so it is not clear what the proposed materials would be. It is also noted the the surrounding properties within this parade of shops have only been permitted retractable awnings in order to preserve openess within the parade.  The proposed development is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development that would not positively respond to local distinctiveness.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer previously raised concerns that affixing anything to the decking fence that would increase its overall height could adversely impact upon drivers' visibility. The development is therefore likely to adversely impact on visibility for highway users such that there could be harm to highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r2x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and building; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would appear a subordinate and an appropriate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would project to a maximum depth of 4 metres, which would exceed the maximum in APD1.  However, given the modest flat roof height of the proposed ground floor extension, the existing ground floor extension at no.17 and the proposed two storey extension being set away from the side boundary with no.11, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r",
    "The proposed dwelling benefits from permission for a two storey side extension which is not part of the original footprint. This extension has been shown on the existing plans. The council also holds evidence by way of a building control application that this permission is in the process of being implemented. It is therefore considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the additional roof extension alongside the existing extended roof space would not exceed 50m3.\r\r\r",
    "The proposed rear doemer would also have two side elevational windows. it has not been demonstrated that these windows would be obscure-glazed and non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed in conflict with B.2(c)(i) & (ii)",
    "The submitted site plan does not show the proposed development in hatched or shaded. Please provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "The red ouline in the location plan and site plan is different, please amend the drawings with the correct red outlines.",
    "The submitted proposed elevations do not show the position of solar panels and do not have annotated dimensions. Please amend the proposed elevations to show proposed solar panels and annotated dimensions.",
