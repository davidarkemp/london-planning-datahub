    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The rooflights hereby permitted shall be of a conservation style, constructed in timber and set flush with the plane of the roof in which they are inserted. The rooflights shall be retained as such for the lifetime of the development.\r\rReason:In order to preserve or enhance the character of this part of the Conservation Area in accordance with Policy CS8 (Character, Heritage and Design) and Policy DM 12 (Development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling on the corner of a junction between Robin Hood Way and Rydal Garden, located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r.\rRelevant Planning History\r14/14571/HOU- Erection of 2 storey side extension following demolition of existing detached garage.- REFUSED 25.07.2014, for the following reason:-\rThe proposed two-storey side extension, by reason of its size and design would fail to appear subservient to the host dwellinghouse and would uncomfortably with surrounding properties to the detriment of the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contra to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy, Adopted April 2012 and The Residential Design Guidance Supplementary Planning Document, Adopted July 2013.\r14/15243/HOU- Erection of two storey side extension following demolition of existing detached garage. GRANTED 28.01.2015\r\r12x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe Proposal\rDemolition of existing detached garage and erection of two-storey side extension, single-storey rear extension and new front porch.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r- The impact of the development on parking and highway safety; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment The two-storey side extension proposed would be only partially visible from the Robin Hood Way streetscene, to the front of the host property. Officers therefore consider the proposal would not appear out of keeping with the existing dwelling, streetscene, or surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rGiven that the proposed rear extension would replace an existing conservatory extension and the proposed rear extension would only project 2.708 metres to the rear, the proposed development would not cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the neighbouring property at no.16 Rydal Gardens. In terms of loss of daylight and direct sunlight, the ground floor extension proposed, would be on the North side of the adjoining property at no.16 Rydal Gardens. As a result of the location of the proposed extension, the proposed extension replacing an existing conservatory extension and the proposed depth of projection to the rear, the proposed development would not cause a significant loss of daylight and direct sunlight to no.16 Rydal Gardens.\rIt is also considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would not generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however it would be in keeping with host property and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the loss of a garage space. No access to secure cycle parking facilities is indicated with the proposal. In accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, a condition is added, to provide to secure cycle parking facilities with this proposal.\r\rThe existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate 2x spaces for on-site parking. The PTAL for Rydal Gardens, is 1b. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1.5 spaces per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 1 to 2, 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12.\r",
