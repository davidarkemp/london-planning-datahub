    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey end-terrace dwellinghouse located on Albany Mews. The site is located within a blanket TPO area, Flood Zone 2, the Riverside North Conservation Area, the Thames - Side Strategic Area of Special Character, as well as the Thames Policy Area.  \r\rPlanning History\r\r22/01614/HOU - Erection of single-storey rear extension and insertion of first floor side window. Application granted. \r\r22/00730/HOU - Conversion of garage into habitable room, erection of a single storey rear and front porch extensions. Refuse on 04 May 2022. With conditions.\r\rReason for Refusal:\r\rBy reason of its scale, siting, design and appearance, the proposed front extension would not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling resulting in an incongruous appearance when viewed within the street scene, which would also disrupt the rhythm and cohesive nature of the wider area of Albany Mews, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area and the Thames - Side Strategic Area of Special Character. This harm would not be outweighed against any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rConsultations\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations was received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds that:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Car park issues\r- Privacy\r\rThe points raised in relation to the impact of the design of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area, as well as the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of sunlight, and the impact of the proposal on highways are material planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rIn relation to the objection in relation to the disruption caused by construction, due to the nature and size of the scheme, a condition limiting construction hours of the development is considered to be unreasonable. However, in the event of an approval an informative could be included advising the applicant of acceptable working hours and that the Council has formal powers to control noise and nuisance. \r\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection. The\rproposed garage conversion would seem relatively understated in nature & therefore acceptable when viewed from the street. \r\rTree and Landscape Officer - No objection subject to implementation of development in accordance with Tree Protection Plan (Revised).\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on trees. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \rThe impact of the development on drainage. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a contemporary styled single storey rear extension. Whilst this extension would exceed the recommended depth for single storey rear extensions as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, officers consider that this element of the proposal would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwelling. Furthermore, whilst the proposed rear extension would be constructed in a contemporary style, Officers consider its appearance would relate well to the existing dwellinghouse. \r\rAdditionally, the application proposes to install an obscure glazed window on the side elevation of the property. This would be a minor addition to the property and would not detract from its character.  \r\rFurthermore, the application proposes the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable room. This alteration is considered appropriate to the dwellinghouse, and would therefore have an acceptable impact on its character and appearance. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider in relation to amenity is No. 41 Albany Mews. This neighbouring property has not been extended to the rear, but benefits from a large pair of patio doors on the rear elevation of the dwellinghouse which likely facilitate a habitable room. Due to the siting and scale of the proposed development, in conjunction with the siting and size of the neighbouring properties windows, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable impact on levels of sunlight to this habitable room. Similarly as due to the scale of the proposed development, Officers do not consider that the proposal would result in an overbearing appearance. \r\rFinally, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a loss of privacy. \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application site is situated within the Riverside North Conservation Area, which is a designated heritage asset. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A linear area whose form and mature landscape is influenced by the River Thames, alongside which lie ancient riverside estates, important 19th century public works that established Canbury Gardens, a group of large Victorian/Edwardian houses and late Victorian boat houses fronting the river. As the proposed development is considered to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, Officers therefore consider that the proposal would not cause harm to the architectural and historic significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable room. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would result in a loss of access to the rear as well as the loss of a garage. Officers therefore consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the application in the event of an approval for the applicant to provide details of secure onsite cycle parking. \r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application has been reviewed by a Tree and Landscape Officer who considers that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on TPO trees within the vicinity of the application site. Nevertheless, Officers consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the permission in the event of an approval to ensure that the development is carried out in accordance with the provided Tree Protection Plan. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Under Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r",
