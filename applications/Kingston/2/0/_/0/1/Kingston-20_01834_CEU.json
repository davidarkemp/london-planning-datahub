    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have\rcorrectly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from the landowner. Failure to undertake\rthe above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "Side Elevations Plans labels - there is confusion with the labelling of the Side Elevation plans, i.e. Existing Side Elevation 1 corresponds with Proposed Side Elevation 2, and vice versa. For the avoidance of doubt, please re-label the Side Elevation plans."
