    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would unduly enclose 108 Richmond Road and unacceptably limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse.\r5x neighbouring properties were sent letters of consultation and no representations have been received by the Council.\r\rCurrent Proposal\rDemolition of a detached shed, conversion of garage into boot room and utility, erection of single storey front porch, side and rear wrap around extension, pitched roof extension on front elevation over proposed boot room\r\rRecent planning history. \r21/02507/HOU Demolition of existing garage. Erection of single-storey rear and front extension with two storey side extension-GRANTED 08.11.2021\r22/01621/CPU Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion GRANTED 08.07.2022\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation;\r- Flood risk; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front porch and side extension have an appropriate appearance, especially when viewed from the front, alongside the existing front/side projection at no.14 Northcote Avenue. As such officers consider that on balance it would be acceptable. The proposed development at No.12, is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the streetscene or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: There is an existing ground floor extension to the rear of No.14 Northcote Avenue and a converted air raid shelter, which is to be removed, close to the rear of No.10 Northcote Avenue.  As a result of this context, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 seek to secure future cycle parking in order to promote sustainable travel/transport modes.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal involves the loss of an existing garage, which would be converted to a store. Despite this loss of, the proposed harstanding to the front of the property would be large enough to accommodate 1 off-street car parking space which would conform with London Plan standards. In terms of cycle parking this proposed Boot Room could provide a secure and covered area for cycle parking. \r\rFlood Risk\rParagraph 166 of the NPPF 2021 states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment. \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 echo national policy in these regards.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal relates to the extension of an existing residential dwellinghouse in Flood zone2/3. However, due to the modest scale of the proposed development and subject to condition it is considered that the proposal would not exacerbate/contribute to flood risk in the area.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
