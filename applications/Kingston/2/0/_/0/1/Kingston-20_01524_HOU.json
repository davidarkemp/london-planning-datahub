    "The proposed extension, by reason of its scale, siting and roof form, would be a highly prominent, unduly dominant and incongruous feature within the Kingsmead Avenue and Mayroyd Avenue street scenes and would disrupt the established forward building line on Kingsmead Avenue, thereby resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special \r\rCharacter.\r.\rRelevant Planning History\r21/04121/PAEXT- Erection of single storey rear extension (6.0m in depth, maximum height of 2.5m and eaves height of 2.5m)- REFUSED for the following reason:- \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension is considered to conflict with the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (j) (iii) and A.3 (a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\r22/02046/PAEXT- Erection of single storey rear extension (6.00m in depth, maximum height of 2.88m and eaves height of 2.66m)- PRIOR APPROVAL NOT REQUIRED\r\r10x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1x representations has been received, highlighting the following concerns:-\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\r- Proposal against the principles of section 4.18 of the Residential Design SPD and it would not be in keeping with the host property or the surrounding area. \r- Proposal is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames / LDF Core Strategy 2012. In addition it appears to be contrary to the London Plan Policies 7.4 and 7.6.\r- The proposal would create a rear elevation which would not be in keeping with the host property or the surrounding area. It will appear over dominant when viewed from the adjoining properties. It will be completely out of character with the rear of the row of houses along Bowness Crescent. The property is semi-detached and the proposed extension is not a reasonable distance from the adjoining properties as is part off a street scene. \r- The proposal is \"not appropriate\" to the host building and would detract from the original dwelling as well as the surrounding area and the amenities of the adjoining properties.\r- The proposal \"overwhelms\" the original building, not because of its square footage but because it fails to remain subordinate to the host, and crucially, would be out of character for the existing street scene, albeit from the rear, however this is visible from multiple properties both from the rear, on the other side of Bowness Crescent, as well as also from the side on properties; numbers 35, 33, 31 and 29 Bowness Crescent.\r- The first floor side extension has left a sufficient space between it and the neighbouring property so as to not significantly change the street scene. \r- Without sufficient spacing the properties will appeared as terraced rather than pairs of semi-detached.\r\rCase officer response- In common with the approved scheme at no. 23 Bowness Crescent (21/02565/HOU), the proposed first floor side extension is set in at the shared boundary by 500mm at first floor level, with the current scheme. This would result in a balanced appearance, when both semi-detached properties, are viewed in conjunction with one another. Additionally, the proposed first floor side extension being set in at the shared boundary would make the current proposal appear subordinate to the main dwellinghouse. The remaining issues highlighted in this representation are addressed later in this report, in so far as they are related to planning.\r\rThe Proposal\rDemolition of existing side extension erection of part two storey part single storey side and rear extension. \rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r- The impact of the development on parking and highway safety; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment The two-storey side extension proposed would not be entirely in keeping with standards set out in SPD1. However, a similar scheme has been granted planning permission (21/02565/HOU) at no. 23 Bowness Crescent in October 2021. The approved scheme (21/02565/HOU) at no. 23 Bowness Crescent, included the following design features:-\r- The proposed first floor side extension is set in at the shared boundary by 500mm;\r- The proposed first floor side extension is set down from the ridge;\r- The proposed first floor side extension appears a subordinate addition to the host property and does not detract from the character of the surrounding area. \rAs a result he approved scheme (21/02565/HOU) at no. 23 Bowness Crescent, Officers therefore consider the proposal would not appear out of keeping with the existing dwelling, or streetscene.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rGiven that there is an existing ground floor extension to rear of the neighbouring property at no. 23 Bowness Crescent and first floor component of the proposal being set away from this neighbouring property, the proposed development would not cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure, loss of outlook, loss of daylight or direct sunlight to the neighbouring property to no. 23 Bowness Crescent\r\rBoth the ground and first floor component of the proposal being set away from the main house of the neighbouring property at no. 19 Bowness Crescent would not cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure,  loss of outlook, loss of daylight or direct sunlight to the neighbouring property to no. 19 Bowness Crescent. It is also considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy, as a result of conditions being recommended with an approval. \r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the R/oyal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would not generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however it would be in keeping with host property and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area or with the adjoining property, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal includes no access to secure cycle parking facilities being indicated with the proposal. In accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, a condition is added, to provide to secure cycle parking facilities with this proposal.\r\rThe existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate 2x spaces for on-site parking. The PTAL for Bowness Crescent is 1b. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1.5 spaces per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 1 to 2, 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) the Mayor's London Plan Policy D12.\r\r",
