The original layout of the dwelling has a rear projection and as a result the proposed extension would extend beyond an original side wall and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse.

    "PREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY\rApplication reference 22/00265/HOU - Erection of two-storey side extension and single-storey rear extension. Granted planning permission, dated 10/03/2022.\r\rCONSULTATIONS\r13no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No representations received.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe site comprises of a semi-detached two-storey dwelling located to the northern side of Malden Green Avenue, Worcester Park. \r\rThe site does not comprise of a listed building, nor is it located within a conservation area or local area of special character. \r\rPROPOSAL\rApplication under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission ref: 22/00265/HOU (Erection of two-storey side extension and single-storey rear extension) dated10/03/2022. Variation to include change to design to make the side wall of the proposal rendered rather than brickwork.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development and impact upon character and appearance.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission.\r\rIt is acknowledged that there is no statutory definition of a minor material amendment (MMA) although the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) explains that a MMA is 'likely to include any amendment where its scale and/or nature results in a development which is not substantially different from the one which has been approved'.\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals would see the approved side wall of the extension change from brickwork to rendered white finish. This is the only change proposed in this Section 73 application. The front elevation would remain unchanged from that originally approved, with facing brickwork.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and wider area.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed amendments to condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission reference 22/00265/HOU are considered to maintain appropriate good quality design and would not result in material difference in terms of character and appearance of the proposed development. The proposals are considered to comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.  \r\rRECOMMENDATION\rGrant planning permission.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey detached dwelling located on the south west side of Pine Walk.

The site does not contain a\rListed Building and is not located within a Conservation Area. The site is not located within an EA Flood Risk Zone. There are no TPOs recorded on site.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension and first floor rear balcony with associated changes to fenestration\r\rThis application follows recently granted permission 22/00598/HOU dated 08.04.2022\r\rThis application looks to include a first floor rear balcony that was removed from the last application following advice from the officer dealing with the application.\r\rConsultation\r11 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development fire safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The inclusion of a balcony to the rear of the property would be generally uncharacteristic of the area. Officers note the applicant has made reference to an existing balcony at the rear of No. 13 Pine Walk. This would appear to be the only one within the vicinity. Policy guidance 33 of the Residential design SPD states; \"a balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\" The balcony referenced appears to pre date current guidance. \r\rOverall, The proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of form, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 9 and No. 13 Pine Walk. With regards to No. 9, due to the existing outbuildings already in situ, the proposed rear extension is considered to have no detrimental effect to the amenities of this neighbouring property. In relation to No. 13 Pine Walk, officers note that the proposed rear and side infill extension would be stepped in from the boundary in order to limit an overbearing appearance or loss of light. With regards to the balcony, Officers note the inclusion of a 1.8m obscure glazed privacy screen to limit overlooking with regards to No. 13 Pine Walk. The privacy screen would be 1m in height to the rear and side facing towards No. 9 Pine Walk. It has not clearly been demonstrated that the proposed balcony would not give rise to overlooking and loss of privacy.  For this reason officers consider that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: No Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey end-terrace dwellinghouse located on Pembury Avenue. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r\r9x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: Policy guidance 38 of the residential design SPD states that front extensions should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. Further, any porch roof should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house and should be built at least 0.5m from an existing bay window.\r\rOfficers note that an extension of this proportion and design would be uncharacteristic to a property along Pembury Avenue.  The proposed front porch extension would project  1.36 metres from the front elevation. Overall, it is considered that the proposed front porch would be excessive in scale and would be overly dominant and  incongruous within the street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light. \r\rFire Safety & Highways\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will ensure that new development does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 states that development proposals should also have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that are not adversley affected.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would include the construction of a porch extension to the front of the property. However, a depth of 6.5 metres of hardstanding would be retained to the front of the property, even where the porch extension would be constructed.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).trategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a two storey semi-detached dwelling located on the southern side of Aragon Road.\r\rThe property is also located within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rErection of single storey rear wrap around extension (Re-submission).\r\rPlanning History\r22/00296/HOU- The erection of a single storey rear wrap around extension. REFUSED on 29.03.2022 for the following reason:-\r\"The applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest ground floor habitable room window at No. 52 Aragon Road, and given the relationship between the properties there is a potential for light loss. As such, the proposal has a real potential to cause an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\rThe applicant is advised to resubmit with additional information addressing Policy Guidance 17 of the RBK Residential Design SPD (the 45 Degree Rule)\"\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed extension would exceed the parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, measuring 3.9m to the side and an additional 5.2m to the rear. Officers acknowledge however that this reflects the depth of other rear extensions in the vicinity and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed extension would be finished in materials to match the host building with a flat roof of an acceptable scale. The proposed development would be located to the side and rear of the dwelling and would not be visible from the street.\r   \rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed wrap-around extension element of the development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAs stated above the application property falls within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character (SASC) which is a non-designated heritage asset. As also stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not be uncharacteristic of rear development within the immediate vicinity of the site and would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area due to the established pattern of development in the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Tudor Estate LASC.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rThe proposed rear extension would not accord with parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth. However, the proposed extension would align with the existing rear extension at No.56 Aragon Road and would be stepped away from the common shared boundary with the property at No.52 Aragon Road As a result of the height of 2.944 metres and the proposal being stepped away from the common shared boundary with the property at No.52 Aragon Road, the proposal would have no significant impact on no.52, in terms of loss of outlook, sunlight/daylight. It has not been demonstrated that the development would not have any undue loss of amenities in this regard.\r\rThe applicant has submitted additional information with regards to daylight/sunlight impact. \r\rTaking the submitted information into account and the orientation of the properties - Officers conclude that any impact would be minimal and only for short periods of the day. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.   \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

Whilst the proposed extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers note that an extension of similar scale and design could be constructed under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. Furthermore, the proposed development would not be a wholly uncharacteristic addition to the streetscene, as seen by the existing side/rear dormer extensions at No. 72 Villiers Road and the recently approved similar proposal at No. 84 Villiers Road (22/01256/HOU).
