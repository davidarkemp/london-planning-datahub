    "The proposed single storey rear extension would result in a significant loss of daylight to habitable room windows, an overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining Nos. 165 and 169 Thornhill Road by reason of its excessive depth and height along the shared boundaries. The proposed development would result in a significant adverse impact on the amenities of adjoining properties contrary to Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/00197/HOU- Erection of single storey outbuilding garden room attached to existing garage- REFUSED 25.03.2022- for the following reason:-\r\"The applicant has failed to demonstrate with the submission of a detailed Tree Protection Plan that the proposed development would not harm the health and longevity of existing trees on this site, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2012 and guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.\"\r\r11x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation has been received, which highlights the following concerns:-\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Too close to site boundary\r\rCase Officer comment- The above issues will be addressed later in this report, in so far as they relate to planning.\r\rKingston Tree Officer:  No objection - The two trees previously identified as requiring tree protection measures have since been identified as diseased and needing urgent removal, therefore I have no objections to the proposals and do not seek any extra measures in terms of tree protections.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- The impact on trees.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed development would be attached to the rear of an existing garage and would not be highly visible or incongruous within the street scene or wider area. The proposed extension would be a subordinate addition. Officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rCase Officer response: The proposed garden room would be attached to the rear of the existing garage. The proposed development would project 4.175 metres to the rear of the neighbouring building line at no.5 Arnold Drive and would be set in from the shared boundary by approximately 0.5m. It is also noted that the proposed development would be situated to the north of neighbouring No. 5. Given that the proposal would appear proportionate and subordinate to the existing dwelling, is relatively modest in scale and is set-back from the site boundary it is considered that there would be no significant adverse impact on the amenities of No. 5 by way of loss of daylight/sunlight, overbearing, loss of outlook or loss of privacy. The proposal is set sufficiently away from No. 3 Arnold Drive to the north to ensure no adverse impact on neighbouring amenity.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rImpact on Trees\rIt is noted that application ref: 22/00197/HOU was refused as it had not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not harm the health and longevity of existing trees on this site. Following this refusal, the Tree & Landscape Officer has since confirmed that the two trees previously identified as requiring tree protection measures are diseased and require urgent removal. As such, no objection is raised by the Tree & Landscape Officer to the current planning application and no tree protection measures are required.\r\rConclusion\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would be acceptable and in general accordance with the development plan.\r",
