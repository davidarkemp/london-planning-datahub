    "The proposed extension and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing garage and erection of single storey side extension to form cycle store, boot room and utility room.\r\rConsultation\rFourteen neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer - No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on Parking; and,\r- The impact of the development on Flooding\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to be considered in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 36 and No. 40 Ditton Road. Due to the location of the proposed development it is not considered to adversely affect the amenity of No. 40 Ditton road. In relation to No. 36 Ditton Road, Officers acknowledge the dining room window on the western elevation. It is also noted that this would not be the only source of light to this habitable room as there is also a source of natural light from the adjoining kitchen window. Due to the proposed side extensions eaves height, combined with the proposed roof pitch and separation distance, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 36 Ditton Road by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the existing garage may be too small to accommodate a modern car. Despite the loss of the existing garage with regards to storing a car, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. Access to the garage would be retained and there would be provision of dedicated and secure cycle storage and access from the front of the property.  The proposal is therefore considered to achieve general compliance with Policy T5.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
