    "Condition 7 \r\rThe applicant has not adequately demonstrated that condition 7 (Fire Strategy Statement), of planning permission 22/02039/FUL can be discharged. The information submitted is of insufficient detail to clearly demonstrate that the terms of the condition have been met. For example, one issue is that no detailed Evacuation Strategy is included within the submission. The information submitted is of insufficient detail to clearly demonstrate that there is:-\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape and an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. \r\rThe Fire Safety Strategy must also include a statement of competence in the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
