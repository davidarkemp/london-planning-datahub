Additionally, the approved planning permission 23/00373/HOU in combination with the proposed dormer would appear bulky and highly incongruous in the immediate vicinity of Bonner Hill Road and would be visible from Hampden Road. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rAlthough officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight or daylight, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring property No. 28 and No. 32 Albert Road by reason of overbearing appearance.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located in a Zone 2 Flood Risk Area.\r\rConsultations\r- 9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r- RBK Tree and Landscape Officer - No Objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Tree & Landscape.\r- Flood Risk\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant submitted plans and elevations that show a proposed rear extension that would extend past the existing extension by 1m. The extension would be located towards the northern flank of the dwelling house, at a distance of 4.5m from neighbouring property No.43 Auckland Road. In total, the proposed rear extension would be 2.8m in depth. The proposed height of the pitched roof (on the side) would be approximately 3.6m and a flat roof height at the rear would be approximately 2.4m.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed side/rear extension would be visible from Buckingham Road and the total depth of the proposed rear extension (including the rear extension granted under planning permission 04/12177/FUL) would be approx 4.7m, falling outside the Residential Design SPD. However, the proposed pitched roof would create better uniformity with the pitched roof of the host dwelling, the proposed height would be modest and matching material would reduce harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. Given that the proposal would be at a substantial distance (4.5m) from No.43 and only extend past the existing rear extension by 1m, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees and Landscape\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Tree Protection Plan and an Arboricultural Method Statement, the council's Tree and Landscape officer has assessed the details and has raised no objection to the proposed extension. The submitted Tree Protection Plan and Arboricultural Method Statement will further be secure through conditions. \r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Flood Risk Assessment, therefore, a planning condition is required to ensure that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and that appropriate floodproofing of the proposed development has been incorporated, in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r\r23/00020/HOU - Demolition of existing conservatory and erection of part single part two storey rear extension. Prior approval was refused on 06.03.2023 for the following reasons:\r\r1. By reason of bulk, depth and design, the proposed development would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwellinghouse and would appear incongruous from the wider area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Guidance 2012.\r\r2. By reason of height, depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of No. 32 and No. 36 Albert Road by reason of overbearing appearance, as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rAssessment\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application (23/00020/HOU) which was refused as the two storey rear extension would appear bulky in the immediate vicinity of Albert Road. The two-storey rear has now been omitted and the current proposal only involves the demolition of an existing rear extension and the erection of a new single storey rear extension.\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed single-storey rear extension would have a depth of approximately 3.9 falling outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. However, the depth of the extension would not be different from the existing extension on site. Additionally, the slightly sloped pitched roof would be approximately 3.1m in compliance with Policy Guidance 33 and the extension would not be visible from the streetscene. \r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. The extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 32 Albert Road, as they benefit from an existing single storey rear extension that would be at the same depth as the proposed rear extension. No.36 Albert Road sits at a reasonable distance from the boundary of No.34 Albert Road, therefore, significant harm would not be caused by the proposed rear extension. Additionally, as mentioned above the existing situation would not be greatly different from the proposed rear extension.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments to planning permission reference 21/03821/KPSID:\r-\tChange to landscape levels, a pumped SW solution, foul water pumping to the Victorian block and other associated works.\r\rThrough the parent permission, a Drainage Strategy was submitted which identified ground levels for the site. In the car park area, ground levels were anticipated as being 15.9m AOD. The new drainage plans submitted now show a change to ground levels in the car park area with levels ranging between 15.45m and 15.9m AOD. The changes to ground levels are considered to be modest in scale and nature. \r\rThe ground levels themselves were not identified on any of the approved drawings for 21/03821/KPSID and the applicant has confirmed that the changes do not affect the ground level to existing / new buildings and the approved drawings remain accurate. \r\rThrough the consideration of planning application 21/03821/KPSID, a drainage strategy was found acceptable and secured through conditions 1 and 19. A change to the drainage strategy is now proposed. These are a result of a 3m UKPN 'cable rights only' zone which bisects the site and now requires attenuation storage below the MUGA to the west of the site and, due to the required level of the attenuation tank, a pumped outfall to Thames Water Assets on Burlington Road is now required.  Foul water pumping is also now proposed for the Victorian Block, where the UKPN cable rights zone conflicts with the approved proposals.\r\rThis NMA application seeks to amend conditions 1 and 19 to reflect the updated drainage strategy. The amended drainage strategy has been considered and found acceptable by the Council's Drainage Officer through a separate discharge of conditions application (23/01715/CLC). The change to the drainage strategy does not impact on the development itself and this change is not considered to give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the development from the streetscene or to neighbouring amenities. \r\rThe interests of any third party or body who participated in or were informed of the original decision are not considered to be disadvantaged in any way.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be non-material and it is recommended that the application be granted.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 19 (Drainage) of planning permission 21/03821/KPSID, which states (as amended through 23/01718/NMA):\r\rPrior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the drainage system as identified in the drawings and documents below shall be implemented in full and permanently maintained thereafter.\ro\tDrainage Management Plan (Shockledge, June 2023)\ro\tFlood Risk Assessment & Surface Water Drainage Strategy (Shockledge June 2023) \ro\tSUDS proforma \ro\tProposed Below Ground Drainage Layout Plan Drawing 010100 PO8 \ro\tSurface Water and Foul Water Manhole Schedule\ro\tBelow Ground Drainage Construction Details Sheet 1\ro\tBelow Ground Drainage Construction Details Sheet 2\ro\tBelow Ground Drainage Construction Details Sheet 3\ro\tBelow Ground Drainage Construction Details Sheet 4\ro\tBelow Ground Drainage Construction Details Sheet 5\ro\tFoul Water Comparison Drawing\ro\tSurface Water Comparison Drawing\rReason: To prevent the development from increasing the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere, in accordance with policy SI13 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\rThe site is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal relate to the demolition of existing outbuilding, erection of two storey side, single storey rear extension. Associated changes to fenestration.\r\rThis application follows granted permission 22/00038/HOU dated 09.03.2022 for the erection of double-storey side extension with first floor and ground floor part rear extensions and associated changes to fenestration. 2 subsequent applications have been submitted following this application.\r\r 22/03198/HOU dated 09.12.2022 for the demolition of existing outbuilding, erection of two storey side, single storey rear extension and associated changes to fenestration which was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1) The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would appear visually intrusive and overly dominant within the street scene resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, the NPPF (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012\r\r2) It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021).\r\r22/03974/HOU dated 01.03.2023 for the demolition of existing outbuilding and erection of part two storey/part single storey side/rear extension which was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1)The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and would appear visually intrusive and overly dominant within the street scene resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, the NPPF (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012\r\r2) It has not been demonstrated through the submission of a Fire Statement that the proposed development would achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021).\r\rThis application would need to address these reasons for refusal.\r\rConsultation\r10 Neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one objection has been received stating;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Cycle Parking; and\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The removal of the proposed first floor side extension has dramatically reduced the significant scale of the previously refused applications. The proposed development is now considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and due to the siting of the proposed extensions it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. This reason for refusal has therefore been addressed.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the siting of the proposed development, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Officers note there would no openings to the side elevation protecting the privacy of the neighbours on Warren Drive South.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers note the proposed development would result in the loss of the side access to the rear garden and the cycle storage opportunities therein. Officers note that secure cycle parking provision has been detailed within the submitted plans to demonstrate compliance with the above London Plan Policy. \r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments:  Compliance with the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021) have been demonstrated  within the Design and access statement. Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. This reason for refusal has therefore been addressed. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
