    "The erection of a hip to gable and and 2no side dormer roof extensions with removal of 2no chminey stacks and installation of gable window, plus existing garage to be converted into garden room with associated changes to fenestration falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r \rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for the erection of single storey rear conservatory and roof canopy extension. \r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear conservatory and canopy would project approximately 3.6m beyond the existing (original) outrigger. Considering the proposed materials and design, the proposal is considered to be acceptable although not ideal. \r\rDue to its siting it would not be visible within the street view, therefore there would be no impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\rThe application property falls within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in harm to the significance of the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. \r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to both neighbouring properties. \r\rAs the proposal would include windows to the side elevation adjoining No 109 Wolsey Drive, to safeguard amenities of occupiers of this adjoining property a privacy screen approximately 1.7m height shall be installed, which will be secured via condition. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
