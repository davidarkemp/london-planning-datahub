    "The proposed development would fail to provide adequately sized units in accordance with the minimum space floorspace standards set out in the London Plan and the unit proposed at second floor level, within the loft space would fail to provide adequate floor to ceiling heights. As such the proposed development would fail to provide an acceptable standard of accommodation for future occupants, thereby conflicting with policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide an adequate amount of outdoor amenity space for future occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide cycle parking facilities that are secured, sheltered and adequately lit, with convenient access to the street. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS6 and DM8 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to provide a parking \"beat survey\" and demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact on highway safety, or congestion and inconsiderate parking in surrounding roads, thereby conflicting with policy T6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Existing Side Elevations 24-3440-PL-010 - since the proposal is to remove the ramp and railings this must be shown on the Existing side elevations. Please amend and re-submit this plan. Also please check the plan is titled East and West, but the side elevations are not these directions.",
    "Loss of employment land - the proposal is for the change of use of an office, therefore there is a loss of employment land.  Please provide details as required by the Validation Local List (page 70-72)",
    "The submitted location plan does not show the land required for access to the site from a public road/ highway. Please revise the red outline in the location plan to show the access from the public road.",
