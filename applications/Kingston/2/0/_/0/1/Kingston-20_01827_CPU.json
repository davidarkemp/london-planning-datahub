    "It has not been demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the proposed single storey rear extension would not extend beyond the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 3 metres, in conflict with Paragraph A.1(f)(i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "It has not been demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the materials used in any exterior work would be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.3(a) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site is an area of open space located to the east of Wentworth Court, Waterside Close. \r\rThere are trees on the site but these are not TPOs. There are some TPOs within the vicinity.\r\rThe site falls within Flood Risk Zone 3a (High probability).\r\r25 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and 1 objection was received, making the following comments (these issues are considered within the assessment below)\ro\tObject to additional bedroom\ro\tBuilding is too large\ro\tLoss of privacy\ro\tParking issues\ro\tLoss of daylight and sunlight \ro\tLoss of trees and wildlife\r\rPlanning History\r21/04113/FUL - Erection of two storey detached dwelling house and associated parking - Granted 12.08.2022\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rPrinciple of Development\rDesign \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rOther mattters\r\rPrinciple of Development\r\rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application, unless varied through the proposal.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstance since the granting of the original permission.\r\rDesign and Character\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers Comment: \r\rThe proposal is for a single front dormer to the approved building. The dormer is appropriately designed and sited up from the eaves, down from the ridge and in from the sides of the roof. A small rooflight is also proposed which is deemed acceptable. \r\rThe amended design does not diminish the design quality of the overall development and is therefore in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8, DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\rStandard of accommodation\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires developments to provide adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD requires new residential dwellings to provide 50sqm of private garden per family house (+ 5sqm per extra bedroom over three) where the prevailing character of the area allows.\r\rPolicy D12 of the London Plan requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rThe overall floorspace of the building has increased slightly but still satisfies the relevant minimum space standards and amenity space requirements for a 3 bedroom dwelling and also satisfies the requirement for 2.5m floor to ceiling heights over 75% of the GIA area. The additional room benefits from a rooflight and former window and so is likely to benefit from adequate levels of outlook and daylight and sunlight. \r\rOverall, the standard of accommodation is not being diminished. \r\rNeighbour Amenity\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficer's comment: The proposal introduces a front dormer window and rooflight. This is not considered overbearing or likely to result in any additional overlooking or undue loss of daylight to neighbouring properties. \r\rIn summary, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions. The proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rOther matters\rWith regard to highways and parking, the level of vehicular parking (1 no. space) and cycle parking (2 no. spaces) remains appropriate for a 3 bedroom dwelling and in line with London Plan standards. Further details of cycle storage can be secured by way of condition.\r\rThe site is within Flood Zone 3a but the proposed development relates to the second floor of the building. Subject to the flood mitigation secured through the parent permission being secured through conditions, the proposal is considered in accordance with relevant flood policies. \r\rThe proposed development will not impact on other matters including trees, ecology and sustainability. \r\rConditions\rNone of the conditions attached to 21/04113/FUL have been discharged and so these can be re-attached to this permission. \r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above. \r",
    "Consultations\r12no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\rNo planning history recorded.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the conversion of existing garage into habitable space.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, link detached dwellinghouse. \r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r-\tThe Impact upon Highways; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals seek to convert the integral garage into a habitable space with associated change from existing garage door to a window of a similar appearance to the existing main windows within the front elevation of the property. This is considered to be an acceptable alteration which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe conversion of the garage and alterations to the fenestration would not cause any materially harmful impacts to neighbouring amenity.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rImpact upon Highways\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space. The garage is capable of fitting a modern car. \r\rThe area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used for car parking.\r\rAs such, the conversion would not result in adverse impact upon highway safety.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered not to result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. In addition adequate car parking space for the property would be retained to the frontage, to the satisfaction of the Council.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",
