    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous feature that would constitute a cramped form of development that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene, compete and detract from the main residential building on the site, Genesis House, have an appearance of being shoehorned onto the site and be out out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area. The proposed development would also fail to either preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area that the site sits within and cause less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit.  Therefore, the proposal does not accord with Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 196 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate in the absence of a supporting daylight/sunlight report/survey that the future occupants would have an adequate provision of daylight/sunlight. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The general layout and positioning of fenestration is such that the future occupiers of the proposed development would have a limited and somewhat inadequate outlook from within the future property. Therefore, the proposal would not accord with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Condition 3 (Materials) of planning permission 22/03096/HOU  states: \rNotwithstanding the submitted information in relation to facing materials, prior to the carrying out of any above ground works, other than demolition, details of the facing materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved details. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted information is considered to be sufficient. As such, the details submitted in relation to condition 3 are hereby approved.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal \rErection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth. However, considering its modest scale, the proposed design and its siting, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would not be visible within the street view, as such there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene as a result of the proposal. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension that would be approximately 4m deep and 2.8m high, would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the both adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties. \r\rThe proposed side window at the ground floor level, given its size and siting,  is considered not to adversely impact amenities of the occupiers at No 33 in terms of loss of privacy or an undue overlooking. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site is a Grade-II listed building (Entry: 1080091) and lies within the Coombe Hill Conservation Area.\r\rHistoric England Listing Description: Dated 1863. By George Devey. Formerly the stables to Coombe Cottage, built by Devey in 1863. Picturesque free grouping of three principal elements: At the south end the entrance block. 2 storey with gabled attic. The walls are of yellow sandstone and yellow brick with some red brick dressings. In the centre is a carriageway through to the stable yard with a four-centred archway with moulded brick label and voussoirs alternatively of black and white stone. To the left a gable. To the left of this rises a tall brick chimney stack with two tall angle shafts. Steeply-pitched, tiled roof. From the left, there extends back, facing Beverley Lane, two long single storey stable buildings of similar materials. Pantiled roofs. The first is lower and has a timber bell-cote with ogee leaded cupola and wrought iron weather vane.\r\rProposal\rListed Building Consent is sought for the removal of internal partition walls and multi-level false ceilings, new flush ceilings from lounge/living room to extend over new internal partition walls and internal alterations.\r\rConsultations\r5 surrounding neighbours consulted by letter and also by an advert in the local press and notice and a site notice affixed in the vicinity of the application site. No representations received.\r\rMalden and Coombe Conservation Area Advisory Committee - No objection.\r\rRBK Heritage Officer - No objection subject to a conditions requiring all proposed materials and method statements and  details of the position, type and method of installation of all new and relocated services and related fixtures.\r\rAssessment\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 205 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 207 says that where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of) the significance of a designated heritage asset, permission should be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, or all of the following apply:\r\r- The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;\r- No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;\r- Conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and\r- The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape. \r\rIn weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAccording to Paragraph 206, local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas and within the setting of heritage assets in order to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.\r\rIn August 1983 the stables historic and architectural interest and value was recognised, and it was Grade-II Listed by Historic England. Grade-II Listed Buildings are of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them.\r\rThe proposed works would all be internal and would not effect the external apperance of the building. It is also noted that the building has been subject to numerous alterations since its conversion to residential accommodation, in the 1970s and 80s. The proposed finishes will be of an equivalent or higher quality than existing, but are generally cosmetic. The most substantial change is that the finished ceiling level will be raised above the existing timber beams, so that they are visible within the internal space, with the layout also being altered to best use the existing vaulted ceilings in the living space.\r\rRBK Heritage officer is satisfied this will not lead to any harm to the listed building and has requested conditions to the permission are applied to ensure this.\r\rPlease note that, If in commencement of the roofing works any bats are found, or there is evidence of their occupation, all works must temporarily cease and Natural England must be contacted. No work shall recommence until the express consent of Natural England has been obtained and any measures required must to be undertaken in full. This will be included as an informative for the applicants benefit.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the area. The proposals would result in no harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset.  As such, the proposals are considered to comply with the NPPF, 2023, the London Plan, 2021 and the LDF Core Strategy, 2012. \r",
