    "The proposed development would conflict with Condition 3 of Planning permission 09/12241/HOU dated 30/06/2009 and therefore would not benefit from permitted development under Article 3. (4) of the General Permitted Development Order (2015 (as amended).",
    "\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a three-storey, mid-terrace townhouse style dwellinghouse. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprise of predominantly terraced townhouse style dwellinghouses. \r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\r2x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r-\tFlood Risk; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be an acceptable addirion which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rIn terms of a loss of daylight, direct sunlight and an increased sense of enclosure, the loss of amenities caused to neighbouring properties, would not be significant enough to warrant refusal.\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk assessment states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered not to result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. In addition adequate car parking space for the property would be retained to the frontage, to the satisfaction of the Council.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",
