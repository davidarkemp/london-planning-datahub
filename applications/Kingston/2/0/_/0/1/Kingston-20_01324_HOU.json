    "Application Site\rThe site comprises of a semi-detached two-storey dwelling. \r\rThe site does not comprise of a listed building, nor is it located within a conservation area or area of special character.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a two-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration. \r\rPlanning History\r22/01419/HOU - Erection of two-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration. Rear dormer roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Refused planning permission, dated 24 June, 2022.\r\rReason for refusal: \"By reason of scale, height, mass and design, the proposed two storey side and rear extension, would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\"\r\rConsultation\r11no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rNo statutory or internal consultations necessary.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; \r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 (Two-storey Rear Extensions) of the SPD Guidance is applicable to this application.\r\rThe SPD guidance advises that a two storey rear extension may be considered acceptable, particularly in those instances where the dwelling occupies a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwellings. Extensions proposed on a boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted. \r\rIn this instance, the proposed rear extension would not be visible from the main street scene and its impact when viewed from the rear would be limited due to the large gardens and positioning of the property backing onto railway tracks. The proposed rear extension would add infill floorspace to the ground and first floor levels of the property to a depth of 3.9m and width of 1.6m, and would be set away from the adjoining semi-detached property at No. 64 by 3m as existing.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would be constructed in facing bricks to match the host dwelling, which is acceptable. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would preserve and maintain the character of the area and would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property or wider area, in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed two-storey rear extension is not considered to result in undue harm to either neighbouring property at No's 64 and 68 Dukes Avenue. The proposals also include a raised terrace area to the ground floor at the rear nearest to the boundary with No. 68, which is raised from the ground by 1.5m. Officers note that there is already a raised terrace of smaller area to the same height as proposed, and the proposals would merely extend around the rear elevation of the application property. As such, Officers do not consider that the proposals would lead to undue material loss of privacy to No. 68 than is currently the case. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause significant harm to the outlook, privacy and daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers and would therefore comply with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposal accords with the principles contained with policies DM10 in that it would relate well to the design of the existing dwellinghouse and would have no adverse impact on the character or quality of the character of the streetscene. In terms of neighbouring amenity, it is not considered to result in any undue harm in regards to overlooking, loss of privacy, daylight or outlook provision. \r\rThe scheme is therefore considered to be acceptable and in accordance with the LDF Core Strategy Core Policies. Officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
    "Consultations\r3no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\rNo planning history recorded.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of garage into habitable space and erection of single storey rear extension.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, detached dwellinghouse positioned at the end of Grapsome Close cul-de-sac.\r\rThe surrounding properties comprise of predominantly detached and semi-detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r-\tThe Impact upon Highways; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained to the rear. \r\rThe proposals involve the erection of a single-storey rear extension to span the full width of the dwelling to a depth of 3m. The roof is shown to be of a pitch design with two velux windows. \r\rThe extension would comply with Council's guidance on scale and design of single-storey rear extensions as outlined in Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The matching stock brick finish to the rear extension is considered acceptable, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. \r\rTo the front elevation, the proposals seek to convert the integral garage into a habitable room with associated change from existing garage door to a window of a similar appearance to the existing main windows within the front elevation of the property. This is considered to be an acceptable alteration which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling.\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed rear single-storey extension would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties. Officers note that there are no side-facing openings/glazing to the proposed rear extension towards either neighbouring property. The scale and design of the extension is such that it would comply with Council's guidance on such types of development. \r\rThe alterations to the fenestration would not cause any materially harmful impacts to neighbouring amenity.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space, although based on the existing floor plan, it does not appear to be of a size capable of fitting a modern car. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the conversion would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. In addition adequate car parking space for the property would be retained, to the satisfaction of the Council.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r9x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \rOfficer Comment: Planning permission was granted at no.16 Sandhurst Avenue for adding a pitched roof to an existing porch and garage in April 2017 (Planning ref. 17/16101/HOU).  As such, officers consider that that the proposed development would appear an appropriate addition to the host property. Further, officers note that the form and siting of the proposed development would be consistent with the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate streetscene, and as such the proposed development would not appear out of keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development, it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. However, officers feel that for the size of the development sought, securing further details by means of a planning condition, would be unnecessary.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
