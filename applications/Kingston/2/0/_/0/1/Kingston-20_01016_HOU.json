    "The proposed boundary treatment by reason of its height and location would have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of  the streetscene and the surrounding area and would result in an overbearing effect in relation to the adjoining property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to  Policy CS8 & DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (adopted 2012) and policy guidance 44 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 as well as the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe site comprises a two storey semi detached dwelling on the southern side of Priory Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any particular physical or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the demolition of existing garage and shed, erection of single storey side and rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal, no representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would replace an existing conservatory with a single storey rear extension that would align with the rear extension of the neighbouring property. The extension would accord with the Residential Design SPD in terms of scale and external design.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.   \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to consider are Nos 48 and 52 Priory Road.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension would align with the existing rear extension at No.52, would be of an appropriate scale and extetrnal design; and setback from the shared boundary with No.48 Priory Road. \r\rOfficers therefore consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight or privacy. \r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a two storey detached dwelling located within the SouthBorough Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for a second dropped kerb and replacement of existing iron gates with wooden gates. \r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rTrees and Landscapes Officer: The proposals necessitate the removal of a high amenity value tree in the conservation area which would be mitigated by replacement planting as shown on their plans, but this should be secured via a planting plan prior to determination and the replacement tree should, at the time of planting, be of the same size and species as that which it replaces which is an American Sweetgum (Liquidambar Styraciflua) at a height of 6m with a clear stem of 2m. Such a tree can be obtained from Hillier or Barcham nurseries for instance (Hillier having a lesser carbon footprint due to being closer geographically). This should be planted at the beginning (Oct-Nov) of the first planting season following completion of the development.\r\rHighways: No Highways objection in principle, however, the proposed new crossover will require a separate Crossover Application to Highways and its provision will be dependent on a site visit to confirm that it would comply with the RBK Crossover Policy. The crossover does not fall within 10 metres of a junction and there does not appear to be any street tree which might be impacted by the new crossover.\rThis is a straight section of highway and the new access would meet pedestrian visibility splay requirements were the upper fencing and vegetation along the front boundary wall removed and/or replaced with railings. This may be required (following site survey) although it is noted that the established crossover has visibility restricted due to this fencing. The wooden gates are indicated as opening inwards so as not to obstruct the footway.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood CAAC- No objection \r\rAssessment\r- The main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on designated heritage assets; \r- Impact on Trees; \r- Highway impacts; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- Fire Safety. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rTypically, boundary treatments in the surrounding area comprise low brick walls, paired with vegetation or railings or substantial vegetation retaining permeability and a softer and 'green'  appearance. The proposed replacement gates would introduce a solid finish as opposed to the existing gates which are permeable. The proposal would introduce a more oppressive appearance to the soft and green character of the area and, as such, would cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: An area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash. \r\rTypical boundary treatments within this conservation area comprise relatively low brick walls supplemented by vegetation or railings which present a more softer appearance and contribute to the 'green' character of the area. The together with the generous set back of properties from the street create a generous sense of space. There are examples of taller boundary treatments, however, these are few and generally include railings with vegetation behind which retains the soft appearance and permeability. The proposal would increase  solidity within the boundary treatment which would serve to erode the soft and green character of the area. Officers are aware of a similar proposal at No.21, however, there is no evidence of planning consent for this proposal. Notwithstanding, this is an exception in the street rather than the norm. The proposal is considered to cause less than substantial harm to significance of the Southborough Conservation Area and no public benefit has been identified to outweigh the harm. \r\rTrees\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe Trees and Landscapes Officer has reviewed the proposals and raises no objection subject to a replacement planting plan. The applicant has not provided sufficient details, however, this would be secured via planning conditions subject to approval. \r\rHighways\r\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF is clear that: Development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rLocal Policy DM10 requires new developments to have regard to highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe councils Senior highway engineer raises no objection in principle to the additional dropped kerb, however, raises concerns that the existing boundary treatment (brick pillars/ brick wall with timber fencing on top) located immediately adjacent to the pavement which is proposed to be retained would not provide adequate visibility splays for pedestrians/cyclists passing the site. As it stands the proposal would not comply with the Council's Vehicle Crossover Policy April 2020 and the DfT Manual for Streets 2007, Policy DM10 of the London Plan, Policy T2 of the London Plan 201 and paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: It is not considered that the proposal would compromise the amenities of this property in terms of loss of outlook, privacy or of daylight/sunlight. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r \rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
