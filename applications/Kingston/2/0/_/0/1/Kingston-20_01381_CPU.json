    "The erection of hip to gable end and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 2 x rooflights to front roofslope and alterations to soil and vent pipe fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Dudley Road. The site is situated within an Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rPlanning History\r\r21/00179/FUL - Installation of rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Application Granted on 31 Mar 2021. With conditions.\r\r20/01328/FUL - Erection of side dormer loft conversion to first floor flat. Refuse on 18 Sep 2020. Appeal dismissed on 11 May 2021.\r\r20/00299/FUL - Erection of a side dormer roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Refuse on 22 Apr 2020. Appeal dismissed on 19 Oct 2020\r\r19/02330/FUL - Erection of side dormer roof extension, installation of 3x roof lights, following removal of existing chimney. Refuse on 12 Nov 2019. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations were received. These representations were both from the same neighbouring address and a duplicate of one another. These representations OBJECTED to the application on the grounds that:\r\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings. Proposed scale of building would be obtrusive and out of keeping. \r\rThe points raised relate to the impact of the development on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area, as well as the amenity of neighbouring properties. As such, the points raised are valid planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey outbuilding to the rear of the garden of the application site. This extension would have a flat roof and would measure approximately 2.5 metres in height, and would measure approximately 3.5 metres in depth. Officers consider that the proposed development would be of an acceptable scale and modest design, and as such would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey outbuilding close to the boundary of the neighbouring properties at No. 27 Dudley Road & No. 31  Dudley Road, as well as No. 4 Livesey Close. \r\rIn relation to the two neighbouring properties at No. 27 Dudley Road & No. 31  Dudley Road, both of these properties benefit from single storey outbuildings to the rear, of similar design and proportions to the proposed. As such Officers consider that the proposed development would not have a significantly unacceptable impact on the amenity of these neighbouring properties by reason of an overbearing appearance, or loss of sunlight. \r\rFurthermore, no windows are proposed on the side elevations of the outbuilding and as such the proposal would not result in a loss of privacy. \r\rIn relation to No. 4 Livesey Close, whilst the proposed development may be situated closed to the boundary with this neighbouring property, being set in approximately 0.3 metres from the boundary, due to the modest scale of the proposed outbuilding, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a significantly unacceptable impact on the amenity of this neighbouring property by reason of an overbearing appearance or loss of sunlight. Similarly, the application does not propose any windows facing this neighbouring properties and as such the proposal would not result in a loss of privacy to No. 4 Livesey Close. \r\rAs such, Officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
