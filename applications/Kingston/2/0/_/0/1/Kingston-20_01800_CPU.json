    "The proposed extension and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi detached dwelling and is located within the Norbiton Station Area Article 4 boundary that removes permitted development rights for change of use from Class E (commercial, business and service) to residential use. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a proposed side roof extension with 2no. Juliet balconies.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. \r\rOfficers note the application property has a distinctive angled roof profile unlike any of the other surrounding properties, which comprises a variety of house and roof types. The proposed roof extension would result in a flat style roof which is necessary to ensure the extension remains below the ridge line. The property is not highly visible given its siting in the corner of Audric Close.  \r\rAs such, the proposed roof extension with 2 no Juliet balconies  is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. No objection is raised to the use of render to the external walls to match the host dwelling. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and scale of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or privacy. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide a Proposed Roof Plan at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions of the proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged."
