    "The flat roof form on the proposed first floor rear extension would fail to relate to the hipped rooms on the host dwelling. As a consequence, the proposed development would have a detrimental impact to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2016) and Policy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Thames Water will aim to providecustomers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where itleaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of theproposed development.",
    "The submitted proposed plan view is labelled as existing, please revise the plan view (Roof Plan) with the correct labelling.\rPlease provide existing and proposed roof plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged."
