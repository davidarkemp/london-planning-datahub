    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)..",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Somerset Avenue. The site is situated within Flood Zone 2. \r\rPlanning History\r\r882130 - Erection of a single storey rear extn (No 154). Application Granted on 19 Jan 1989. With conditions.\r\r10154 - Erect garages and workshops. Application Granted on 04 Aug 1972. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on drainage. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of a first floor side extension above an existing single storey side extension. This extension would be set back from the front elevation of the property by approximately 0.5 metres and would be set in from the side boundary of the property by approximately 1 metre. The proposed extension would not be set down from the ridgeline in line with the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD. Whilst it is not ideal that the proposed extension does not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling, and would therefore have an acceptable impact on its character and appearance. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure approximately 4.7 metres in depth and would have a pitched roof with a maximum height of approimxately 3.7 metres. Whilst the proposed extension would far exceed the recommended maximum depth as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts to the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse as a result of the proposed development.   \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity would be No. 152 and No. 156 Somerset Avenue. \r\rIn relation to No. 152, the application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension on the boundary with this neighbouring property. Whilst the depth of the proposed may be considered excessive, the proposed development would be sited away from any habitable room windows, and as such would not result in an unacceptable loss of light. Furthermore, considering the application also proposes the removal of an existing garage on the application site, the proposed development would likely result in increased levels of daylight/sunlight to this neighbouring property. In addition, due to the scale of the proposed rear extension in conjunction with its siting, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an overbearing appearance on this neighbouring property. Finally as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on amenity of No. 152 Somerset Avenue through a loss of privacy. \r\rIn relation to No. 156 Somerset Avenue, as this property benefits from a single storey rear extension of similar proportion to the proposed, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
