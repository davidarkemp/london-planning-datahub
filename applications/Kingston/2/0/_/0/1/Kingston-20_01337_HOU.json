    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r \r",
    "The development  hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roofs of the extensions hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The application site is a two storey semi-detached dwelling located to the east of Westbury Road, New Malden. The existing building has a hipped tile roof with brick, tile and render facade. \r\rThe surrounding area is residential in character with some variation in scale, form and style. \r\rThe existing building is not a statutory or locally Listed Building and is not located in a Conservation Area.\r\rFlood Zone 1.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified with no responses received.\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r21/01593/CPU - Erection of front extension and conversion of existing garage to habitable space with associated changes to fenestration - Refused 23.07.2021\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rConversion of garage\rDesign \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rLoss of parking\r\rConversion of garage\r\rPlanning permission is not normally required for the conversion of garages to habitable space and there is no known planning history (or conditions) that would remove permitted development rights. Notwithstanding, there is sufficient space at the front of the property to accomodate a vehicle. Overall, the change of use to habitable space is therefore considered acceptable.\r\rDesign \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy Guidance 38 states that when designing a front extension the following guidance will apply: \r- Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. \r- New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. \r- Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation. \r- The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house.\r- All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties. \r- Front extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported. \r- Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rThis proposal is for a modest front extension to the side of an existing porch. The extension extends 610mm to the depth of the existing porch and projecting bay. The design and pitched roof would match that of the existing porch. \r\rWhilst there are few examples of front extensions that extend the full width of the property (when taking into account the existing front bay), there is a great deal of variation along Westbury Road and the proposal is in itself a modest addition. On this basis, the proposal is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area and is in accordance with the NPPF, Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013). \r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed front extension is adjacent to the boundary with New Malden Baptist Church. Two new ground floor windows are proposed.  Given the modest scale of the extension, the use of the neighbouring premises and as these windows are obscure glazed, it is not considered that the proposed extension would result in an undue impact on the amenity of this neighbour.\r\rThe extension is modest in depth and would not result in harm to the amenity of any other neighbours.\r\rFor these reasons, the proposed development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rLoss of Car Parking\r\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 2 (very poor). The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) with few parking restrictions in the area.\r\rThe applicant states that the existing garage and forecourt area are not of sufficient size to accommodate a car. The garage is 2.25m wide and the forecourt area is 3.6m in length. It is accepted that it is not possible to accommodate an average sized car in either the garage or the forecourt area and so it can reasonably be concluded that the proposal will not result in any overspill parking on surrounding roads or result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rThe proposal is therefore in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above. \r",

Those details shall include a timetable for its implementation, and a management and maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development which shall include the arrangements for adoption by any public body or statutory undertaker, or any other arrangements to secure the effective operation of the sustainable drainage system throughout its lifetime.\r\rReason: To prevent the increased risk of flooding in accordance with Policies D4 and SI 13 of the London Plan (2021), Policy CS1 (Climate Change Mitigation) of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r13 (Living Roofs) - Prior to occupation details of the proposed species related to the living roofs and their associated irrigation systems and maintenance shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.
