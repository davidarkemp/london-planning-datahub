    "The proposed rear extensions, by reason of their scale and siting, would appear overbearing when viewed from 19 Cranborne Avenue, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its scale and roof form, would relate poorly to the host property and appear as an incongruous feature, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Condition 3 (External Material samples)\rMaterial samples of the brick and roof tile have been submitted. Whilst not of a particularly high quality, these are deemed acceptable.\r",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans/documents submitted for the purposes of this application are consistent with the parent planning permission reference 20/02942/FUL, however, any inconsistencies would be resolved in favour of the parent permission. An Application for Approval of Details Reserved by Condition should not be used to evolve or modify the scheme in a way that is substantially different from that set out in the application.",
