It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would address the previous reasons for refusal, and would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rThe application is submitted under Section 192 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to ascertain whether the \"Use of part of dwelling to set-up cab company dispatch function from home office\" would be lawful for planning purposes.\r\rThe Letter submitted as part of the application describes the use in more detail -\r\r1. Zero Staff:\rOur business model does not require any staff on the premises. I will be the only one using this office. We will not beemploying any staff from home.\r\r2. The majority of our communications/bookings will be via email:\rOur bookings will be through:\ra. Website\rb. Our App\rc. Email\rd. Phone\r\r3. We will specialise in contract-based and pre-bookable work only; we will not provide 'ad-hoc' and'impromptu' daily local rides service; we will not have any walk-in customers; no drivers will be required tocome to our premises:\ra. We will only take bookings which are contract-based (e.g: school-runs) or pre-booked (e.g: airports).\rb. We will not operate a local rides service nor will we take 'asap daily/on-demand/straight-away bookings'\rc. We will not require walk-in customers. No customers will be permitted to turn-up to the property. No pick-ups shallbe booked from the office location. This is not our model.\rb. Due to the above points, it follows that our model will not require any drivers to operate from the site. All our drivers will be operating remotely or from their homes. We will have zero vehicles parked/operating from the site.\r\r4. There will be no disturbance or change to the quality of life enjoyed by our neighbours and theneighbourhood as a whole:\rOur business model does not require any vehicles, customers or drivers on-site, hence there will be zero changes tothe quality of life enjoyed by our neighbours and the neighbourhood. There will be no employees and hence no staffrequired at the office. Nor will we display any business-signs on the property to publicise the office. As far as theoutside world is concerned there will be no change in how the property is used.\r\rBased on the information provided by the applicant (see above), the use described would not amount to a material change of use of part or whole of the house and therefore planning permission is not required.\r",
    "This Lawful Development Certificate has been granted based on the information submitted. If visitor numbers and/or activity increase to an extent not normally associated with the use of the building as a single family dwellinghouse, express planning permission will be required to change the use of the building. No adverts should be displayed that would undermine the\rprimary use of the building as a family house and there should be no external alterations to the building that might change the character of the building away from that of a dwellinghouse.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a two storey semi detached dwelling.\r\rThe front part of the property is located within a Flood Risk Area Zone 2.\r\rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for demolition of existing rear storage room, erection of single storey rear extension, erection of hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 2no. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. One representation was received objecting to the proposal on the following grounds:\r\rScale and height of the proposed single storey rear extension;\rOverbearing impact;\rLoss of light;\rLack of detail regarding external treatment of the proposed extension.\r\rAll of the above will be addressed within this report.\r  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rProposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This is particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, much like the application site. However, Officers have had regard to the fallback position (which is a material planning consideration) of permitted development rights under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015, which would allow for a hip to gable roof conversion as proposed to be constructed without notifying the local planning authority. In addition, a number of neighbouring properties in the immediate vicinity have constructed a hip to gable roof extension. As such, this element of the proposal is unlikely to have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.  Officers also note an application to modify the roof of the neighbouring and adjoining property has recently been submitted. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear and side extension would be located along the shared boundary and whilst of an acceptable height, would be 5.7m in depth exceeding the Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Officers note there are other larger single storey rear extensions in the vicinity of the property, but also that the neighbouring property has not been extended.\r\rExternal details of the proposed works have been shown and would be in keeping with the host dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that the proposed development would not appear disproportionate to the host dwellinghouse and would have an acceptable impact on its appearance. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rThe proposed development would maintain the existing setback from the shared boundary with No.53 Egmont Road and given the siting and design unlikely to have any adverse impact on the amenities of this property. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project 5.7m beyond the rear of No.49 Egmont Road. The excessive depth of the proposed single storey rear extension, and its siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No.49 Egmont Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No.49 Egmont Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. \r\rIt is therefore considered that it would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light  or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: As set out above, the application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk documentation states details flood proofing measures which are considered satisfactory and in compliance with policy SI.12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Mill Street. The site is situated within Flood Zone 2, a Controlled Parking Zone, as well as the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area, and finally the Kingston Town Centre Area of Archaeological Significance.  \r\rPlanning History\r\r93/0554/LDP - Erection of conservatory to rear (LDC) (P). Application Granted on 15 Jun 1993\r\r22/01727/HOU - Erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no rear and 1no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration. Pending consideration. \r\rConsultations\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection. \r\rHistoric England (Archaeology) - Proposal is unlikely to have a significant effect on\rheritage assets of archaeological interest\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on drainage. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension, as well as the installation of one window on the side elevation of the original dwellinghouse. Whilst the materials of the proposed extension would not be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the dwellinghouse, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rNevertheless, Officers consider it appropriate to add a condition to the permission in the event of an approval to ensure that the proposed window in the side elevation of the main dwelling above first floor level is installed as obscure glazed and maintained thereafter. \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. This is a designated heritage asset. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be described as: An early suburb of Kingston Town Centre comprising houses of various sizes and designs dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855. As the proposed development is considered to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, officers subsequently consider that the proposal would not harm the architectural and historic significance of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
