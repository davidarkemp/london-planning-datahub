    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rThe applicant engaged with the Council's pre-application advice service and was advised on what changes could be made to address the concerns raised with the previous refusal of planning permission. This advice has not been followed. On reviewing the current planning application Officers contacted the applicant raising concerns and offered the applicant an opportunity to amend the proposals. However, the applicant chose to progress with the current scheme.",
