    "The development hereby approved shall not commence until a Sustainable Drainage Strategy and associated detailed design, management and maintenance plan of surface water drainage for the site using Suds methods has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved drainage system shall be implemented in accordance with the approved Sustainable Drainage Strategy prior to the first occupation of the dwelling and maintained thereafter for the lifetime of the development.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to prevent the increased risk of flooding by ensuring the provision of a satisfactory means of surface water disposal is incorporated into the design and the build of the proposed development, in accordance with Policy SI 13 (Sustainable Drainage) of the London Plan (March 2021) and Policy DM1 of the Core Strategy Adopted (2012).\r",
    "No work relating to the development hereby approved, including works of demolition or preparation prior to building operations, shall take place other than between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 Monday to Friday and 08:00 to 13:00 Saturdays and at no time on Sundays or Bank or National Holidays. \r\rReason: To protect the occupiers of neighbouring properties from noise and disturbance outside the permitted hours during the construction period, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy Adopted (2012).\r",

Alterations that affect these approved landscape details must be previously agreed to in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted all windows in the front elevation and side elevations at first floor level of the dwellings labelled '6A' and '6B, shown to be fitted with obscure glazing on the  the drawings hereby approved, shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable unless fitted with a restrictor mechanism. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The site comprises an end-terraced dwelling within the Tolworth, Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant proposes to construct a large dormer to the rear of the dwelling. The dormer would not maintain 500mm from the roof ridge, the sides or the eaves of the host dwelling, falling out of the guidelines of Policy Guidance 39, of the residential design SPD. However, flat roof dormers are not incongruous in the immediate vicinity and the flat roof two-storey outriggers at the rear would match the proposal. Additionally, the proposal would not be overly visible from Ewell Road. \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: In relation to the Tolworth, Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies a similar footprint to the pre-existing development on site and it is a roof extension, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within the Richmond Road Conservation Area.\r\rConsultations\rKingston Town CAAC  -  Objection unless revised\rHighways - No Objection\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Sustainable Transportation.\r- Impact on trees.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant seeks advice on the construction of a single-storey side front-to-rear extension, a garage conversion, front and rear dormer windows, along with changes to the fenestration. The works also include alterations to the rear patio by adding steps to the rear garden.\r\rThe proposed wrap-around single-storey rear/side extension would have a staggered depth ranging from approximately 7.2m (towards the boundary shared with No. 197 Richmond Road) to 3m (on the boundary shared with No.201). The extension would have a total flat roof height of approximately 3.1m and towards the front of the property, the roof has a pitched roof feature with a total height of approximately 3.8m.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33, of the residential design SPD states that a single-storey rear extension on semi-detached property should only extend past the rear elevation of the original dwelling by a maximum of 3.5m and a flat roof should stay at 3m in height. Whilst officers acknowledge the proposed single-storey rear/side extension would not comply with this, the proposal would still appear subordinate to the host dwelling and the proposed material would match those used for the existing dwelling. Additionally, the only visible aspect of the single-storey side/rear extension would be the conversion of the garage, which entails the removal of the garage doors and installation of new fenestration to match the existing dwelling. It is also noted that the applicant intends to reduce the width of the side extension which would help prevent a prominent appearance in the streetscene.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed side extension would step forward by approximately 1m but it would not surpass the bay window and it would appear subordinate and subservient to the host dwelling. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 206 of the NPPF 2023 states that any harm to, or loss of, the significance of a designated heritage asset (from its alteration or destruction, or from development within its setting), should require clear and convincing justification.\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Richmond Road Conservation Area can be summarised as: A range of fine late Victorian and Edwardian houses of distinctive groups of red brick construction. \r\rKingston Town CAAC was consulted on the proposed development and made an objection statement: \"The proposal to move forward the front building line of the new side extension is problematic & renders it not subservient to the host property when viewed from the public realm. We note that this is already the case with the garage at the neighbouring property (#201) but that is the exception not the rule in this run of houses. The new extension at #199 should be set back to the front line of the existing garage. In addition, details of the proposed new 'like for like' fenestration, especially to the front of the property, are sketchy: the application mentions new double glazed units whereas the existing are not? & there are no illustrations of the chosen product, only some technical drawings & a brochure largely of casement (not sash) type windows. \r\rEV charge point: The layout drawings indicate a proposed EV charging upstand. This may require a separate planning application as it appears similar in size and format to on-street versions. whilst it is important residencies in CAs should adapt to changing needs, EV charging points should be installed with careful consideration of local heritage and surroundings. The applicant does not indicate if they have contacted the council to confirm if PDR apply\"\rOfficers note CAAC's concerns but as previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in general keeping with the host property and, as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. The applicant states on the application form that the render would be matching to the existing and so would the proposed brick. \r\rThe proposed EV charging point would be a free standing unit and would not detract from the character and appearence of the property or the wider area. In conclusion Officers consider the charging point as a small addition and a positive contribution to sustainability. \r\rGiven that no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers concluded that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has demonstrated on plan that the proposed single storey rear/side extension would not cause a significant loss of daylight to the rear-facing window at No.197, however, officers note the bay window which faces No.199 and serves as an office/playroom, a habitable room. Officers have assessed the impact on this room Additionally, officers have assessed the proposed side/rear extension using the BRE 25 degree rule; the existing side extension/garage has a total height of approximately 3.8m and the proposed has been reduced to 3.2m, as such the side extension would no longer breach the 25 degree rule.  Therefore it is unlikely that there would be a significant loss of light to the office/playroom, especially due to the open plan layout at No. 197 which means that the room also receives daylight from the rear facing fenestration and roof lights. There would be some loss of outlook to the office/playroom and this would be assessed further at the planning application stage following the statutory consultation period.\r\rConcerning No.201 Richmond Road, the proposed rear extension would be a reduced depth in comparison to the existing conservatory, as such would reduce any possible impact on No.201. \r\rThe applicant proposes to extend/increase the raised patio area (which could be used for standing) which initially had a total depth of approximately 3.3m and would now have a depth of 3.7m (shown on the proposed and existing ground floor plan). Officers note the rear elevation drawing shows that the boundary shared with No.197 has a fence or wall with a height of approximately 1.7m from the patio. Additionally, there are shrubs along both shared boundaries that prevent clear visibility into neighbouring properties. However, the applicant is advised to submit further boundary treatment details, such as privacy screens of 1.8m in height at the application stage if the applicant intends to extend the patio/convert the raised beds into raised patio which could be stood on.\r\rOverall, given the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the demolition of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. \r\rThe councils' highways team was consulted on the proposed EV charging point and they raise no objection to the proposal.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comments: Officers acknowledge that there is a protected English Yew on site however, the proposal would not extend beyond the existing patio and the tree sits approximately 12m from the proposed development, therefore, officers raise no concern in regard to the tree on site. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

The approved plan/statement shall be adhered to throughout the construction period. The statement shall provide for:\r\ri) How the proposed development will be built;\rii) Hours of working (which shall be limited to 08.00 to 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 to 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays);\riii) The procedure for loading/unloading materials;\riv) The route to and away from site for muck away and vehicles with materials;\rv) The protocol for managing deliveries to one vehicle at a time on sites with restricted access or space;\rvi) The protocol for managing vehicles that need to wait for access to the site, to include off-site waiting locations, with a requirement to minimise disruption where possible to Penrhyn Road and The Bittoms;\rvii) Whether any reversing manoeuvres are required onto or off the public highway into the\rsite and whether a banksman will be provided;\rviii) Temporary site access;\rix) Signing system for works traffic;\rx) Whether site access warning signs will be required in adjacent roads;\rxi) Whether it is anticipated that statutory undertaker connections will be required into the site;\rxii) The storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles;\rxiii) The potential for impacts from dust and emissions during the demolition and/or\rconstruction phase upon local air quality and surrounding residents;\rxiv) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works;\rxv) The location of all ancillary site buildings;\rxvi) The means of enclosure of the site, its erection and maintenance;\rxvii) Wheel washing equipment;\rxviii) The parking of vehicles of site operatives and visitors;\rxix) Meeting the requirements of the Low Emission Zone for Non-Road Mobile Machinery\r(where relevant plant or vehicles are being used); and\rxx) The method of recycling and disposing of waste resulting from the demolition and/or construction phases\r\rDeliveries/collections to and from the site shall use a route that is agreed with the highway authority and the agreed route shall be signed accordingly.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because therelevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with Policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The Neigbourhood Traffic Engineer has reviewed the submission and objects. Their full comments are below:\r\r'The subject application has been submitted to fulfil the requirements for discharging Condition 44 (submission of a Construction Management Plan (CMP)) as stipulated in the permission grant notice for Application No. 21/03939/FUL, dated 22/09/2023.\r\rA preliminary construction programme has been provided, which indicates that the proposed development is scheduled to be undertaken within a period of 127 weeks from the actual construction work commencement date. Summary details of the construction work activities have been provided by the applicant.\r\rAll construction activities will be carried out from Monday - Friday within the hours of 8am - 6pm and on Saturdays, between 8am and 1pm. No work will be carried out on Sundays and during the bank holidays.\r\rAccording to the CMP, deliveries will be managed by a logistics company who will ensure compliance with the booking-in protocol, which should occur no less than 24 hours prior to arrival on-site. Larger deliveries will be unloaded using tower cranes while others can be unloaded using hoists and forklifts. Traffic marshals will be present at the site entrance gates to ensure the deliveries are unloaded safely and that vehicles exit the site in a safe manner with minimal risk to\rthe public. This is an acceptable arrangement.\r\rIn view of the location of the site, the constraints on traffic and access to the site, a senior member of the site team will be nominated as a liaison responsible for communication with the local highway authorities, school and neighbouring sites regarding traffic movements and road management. This is to ensure planned large deliveries and road maintenance issues are dealt with swiftly and efficiently. This is a reasonable arrangement.\r\rAccording to the applicant, the existing site boundary currently comprises Heras fencing hoarding. However, hoarding will be erected to safely secure the site boundaries. A site gate will be located for access on the Penrhyn Road, which will be a one-way system to cover the access for the south side. Another site gate will be located on Bittoms Road, which will\rprovide access to the west and north side of the site. However, there will be no construction vehicle access at Milner Road. To accommodate the construction vehicles and facilitate their entry and manoeuvring into Bittoms Road, adjacent car parking areas will be temporarily suspended.\r\rThis will allow vehicles to reverse directly into the site without obstruction under traffic marshals supervision. This is an acceptable arrangement. However, the suspension of the parking bays would require RBKs approval. The applicant is to provide exact detail of the parking suspensions required before approval is sought.\r\rConstruction vehicles could access the site via the A240 Penrhyn Road, with vehicles entering the site from the existing vehicular access to the south and exiting to the north. The proposed construction traffic route is considered acceptable. A construction vehicle routing plan for the site has been provided, however, a routing plan from the major roads connecting to Penrhyn Road has not been sighted. In addition, the applicant has not provided any details in regards to the size and frequency of vehicles expected on site for deliveries or taking spoils away from site.\r\rThe applicant proposes to locate the site accommodation, which includes the welfare facilities, internally on the northern point of the site existing building D. However, the location of the materials storage area has not been indicated and a construction site plan, which will show all the site facilities, has not been provided. The developer should note that no storage of materials or waste will be permitted on the public highway or footway to ensure pedestrian / highway safety.\r\rDetails of the wheel washing arrangement have not been provided by the applicant. This is necessary to prevent dirt and debris from being deposited on the local highway.\r\rThe applicant has provided a Site Waste Management Plan (SWMP) which will be implemented to encourage the reduction, reuse and recycle of waste, as part of the principles of the waste hierarchy. The disposal of waste, including excess soil, will be managed to maximise the environmental and development benefits from the use of surplus material and to reduce any adverse effects of disposal. The construction waste management procedure is considered adequate.\r\rThe CMP proposes that there is an existing on site car parking on the frontage along Penrhyn Road which can be utilised for onsite parking. This area will also be used for any visitor parking in relation to the showhome on site. Notwithstanding the above, the developer should encourage the site operatives to use public transport and other sustainable active travel modes to the site. \r\rThe CMP has outlined satisfactory control measures for air quality, noise, dust generation, vibration and pollution during the construction works.\r\rBased on the above comments and specifically, on the outstanding items, Highways object to the discharge of Condition 5, for planning application no. 21/03939/FUL.'",

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear infill extension will not exceed the existing outrigger in depth or extend beyond the width of the main house. Due to the separation distance between the development site and the neighbouring property, No.10 Windsor Road, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.

The trees situated with the application site are protected.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing detached garage and erection of a single storey rear garden studio. \r\rConsultations\rRBK Tree Officer - no objections\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee - insufficient information regarding the proposed nature/use of the outbuilding, commercial use would not be supported. \r\rRepresentations\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. \rFour representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Noise\r - Privacy\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- The solar panels could produce significant glare on neighbouring properties\r- Use of the proposed outbuilding is not clear, provision of a workshop may result in car parking issues or access or traffic problems \r\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed with this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would be situated in the rear garden, the proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.7m and the total height 4.2m. 18 solar panels would be installed on the roof. \r\rThe proposed floor space as indicated on the plans would be approximately 56 sq m, which is comparable to 1 bed 2 persons dwelling (Space Standards, The London Plan).\rIt is noted that the proposed footprint including the covered patio area would be approximately 66 sq m. \r\rOfficers note the existing outbuildings in the immediate surrounding area, that are of significantly smaller mass and bulk. For example the planning permission ref 04/1619FUL (Erection of double garage. Erection of front boundary wall and gates) for the adjoining property No 38, where the approximate floor space is 41sq m and the total height of the dual pitched roof of approximately 4.2m. \r\rAs such it is considered that the proposed outbuilding due to its siting (no separation distances) and excessive mass and bulk would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would not be in-keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy Guidance 41 states that an outbuilding should relate well to the design of the existing house. Officers are not convinced that the proposed design (especially the side elevations) relates well to the host building and semi detached adjoining dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rWith regards to the proposed solar panels, it should be noted that they could visually add to the mass and bulk of the outbuilding. \r\rIt is noted that the proposed use of the outbuilding has not been clearly described, given the predominantly residential character of the surrounding area, a commercial use would not be supported as it would not be compatible with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.   \r                                                                                                               \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  210 of the NPPF 2024 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 212 of NPPF 2024 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rParagraph 216 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site comprises a locally listed building (a non designated heritage asset)  and is located within the Claremont Road Conservation Area (designated heritage asset). The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as 'Part of the original Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley. Development started in 1838, and centred around the landscaped Claremont Crescent Gardens'. \r\rThe proposed outbuilding due to its excessive bulk and mass is considered not to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. As such, it is considered that the proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the locally listed host dwelling and this part of the Claremont Road Conservation Area.  No public benefits have been identified that would outweigh the harm.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note concerns received within the written representations regarding the proposal.\r\rGiven its siting the proposed design and mass and bulk, the proposal would be visible from the adjoining properties, appearing as a dominant and intrusive addition to the surrounding area. \r\rWith regards to the proposed solar panels, considering their number and position, insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that they would not cause glare and therefore would constitute a  neighbourly development. \r\rOfficers raise concerns received within the written representations regarding the intended use of the outbuilding. The submitted Heritage Statement reads: The proposal is to provide a single storey office studio to cater for their company, comprising a small workshop, office, WC and store room. \r\rGiven the predominantly residential character of the surrounding area, a commercial use would not be in-keeping with the character of the area. \r\rTree Officer\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comment: The RBK Tree Officer raised no objections to the proposal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage. The applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Strategy Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "The site comprises a commercial unit on High Street in New Maldon.\r\rConsultation\r\r- 16 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received on the ground that a retail unit is needed rather than an Asian supermarket.\r\rOfficers comments - The application only relates to shopfront alterations with new signage. Further regarding the use of the site, it is noted that the property has been occupied by Wilko which is a retail shop. The new supermarket occupier and Wilko are both considered as E(a) and there will be no material change of use.\r\r- Urban Design was consulted and no objection was raised.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r\rThe site has been used as retail/commercial unit and there have been a number of advertisement applications\r\rAn advertisement application has been submitted and it is not valid yet.\r\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\r\rDesign\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed new shopfront will be black aluminium with the first floor level being a folded fascia panel. There will be 4 light boxes and Internally illuminated signage at first floor level. Alterations at ground floor level would include new signage, frames graphic on glass. Although the new shopfront is overall considered modern and different to the existing character of the surrounding buildings and area, the design, material and colour are considered good quality and it would be an improvement of the existing situation of the application site. Therefore, the proposed shopfront alterations are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would have no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exemption Statement which suitably addresses the reasons this development would not require a fire safety statement. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2024), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021 and the Policies of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\r",

The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, officers acknowledge the existing ground floor side windows of No. 42 The Bittoms, however, due to limited eaves height of 2.4m along the shared boundary coupled with the flat roof element the proposed infill/side extension would not result in an overbearing appearance or result in a detrimental loss of daylight sunlight to the nearest habitable room window. Due to the limited depth, no harm has been identified in relation to No. 46 The Bittoms. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 and 3A. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

However, the proposed extension would have a reasonable flat roof height of approximately 3m. Additionally, the proposed development would not be visible from the streetscene and subordinate and proportionate to the existing dwelling.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Additionally, officers acknowledge the applicants submitted sunlight, daylight and overshadowing assessments. \r\rThe applicant has not provided the ground floor internal layout of No.16, noting the layout at No.14, it is considered that No. 16 would have the same layout as a pair of semi-detached dwellings. Therefore the closest habitable room at No.16 is a dining room. The submitted details demonstrate that the proposed rear extension would breach the 45-degree rule on both plan and elevation, therefore the proposed development would cause significant harm to the daylight of No.16. \r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of a loss of light.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
