    "The proposed alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on protected trees; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers note that the proposal would have a large footprint, however it would have a modest height and given that it would be situated in a fairly substantial rear amenity area, officers consider that it would appear a subordinate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rWhile officers note that the proposal would have many characteristics of a separate unit, given that the proposal has been submitted as a householder application, and that the submitted drawings do not indicate that it would be used as separate accommodation, officers consider that it would not be used for any other purpose other than ancillary/incidental use to the main dwelling house. In any case, a planning condition would secure this in the event of an approval.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that there would be windows on the side elevations, facing neighbouring properties 5 and 7 Manor Way, however given that it would be relatively small-scale and high level windows, and would be separated from the rear elevations of these properties by a minimum of 25m, officers consider it would not result in overlooking or loss of privacy for the occupants of the neighbouring properties on Manor Way. There would also be windows facing the rear of the rear amenity space of 3 Manor Close, and while these windows would be larger in scale, given that it would be immediately facing an existing outbuilding, officers consider that there would be limited overlooking for the adjoining property. \r\rFurter, given the separation distance between the proposed granny annexe and neighbouring properties, and modest scale of the development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that there are no protected trees in close proximity to the proposed outbuilding and would not result in the loss of any mature trees, as such officers consider the proposals impact to trees to be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
