    "The erection of a timber framed log cabin at rear of garden to be used as a hobby room falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Condition 9: The External Lighting Strategy is acceptable and agreed by the Lighting Officer and Environmental Health Officer.\rCondition 11 Cycle Parking facilities:   48 short-stay cycle parking spaces and 14 long-stay cycle parking spaces, as required by Condition 11.\rThe long-stay / staff cycle parking spaces are to be accommodated primarily in two hangers, which provide 12 long-stay cycle parking spaces.   The two additional cycle parking spaces are to be provided within the warehouse, where there is capacity to accommodate non-standard cycles / accessible cycles.   Also provision is made with the short-stay cycle racks for accessible bikes (the last stand in each row is spaced out, to allow space for larger bikes).  The details are agreed by the Highways Officer.\rCondition 24 The Finalised Delivery and Service Management Plan is agreed by the Highways and Environmental Health Officer.\rCondition 26 (Travel Plan) In respect of retail parking, The London Plan states at 10.6.21  that  any provision  for on-site parking that is made should be carefully managed so that it does not undermine the attractiveness of alternatives to the car. The Travel Plan has been amended to promote sustainable transport and discourage staff from driving to the store. Staff parking within the car park will not be allowed, except in exceptional circumstances. Initial objection to the travel plan has been withdrawn.\r",
    "The submitted existing and proposed floor plans have an incorrect scale bar. Please provide Existing and Proposed Floor Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
