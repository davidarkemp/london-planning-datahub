    "The proposed extension is considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a detached bungalow located on Edgecoombe Close. The site is subject to a blanket TPO area, is situated within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, as well as an Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rPlanning History\r\rNo relevant planning history. \r\rConsultations\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rHistoric England (Archaeology) - No archaeological requirement. \r\rTree and Landscape Officer - Objection. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on trees. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes a significant remodelling of the dwellinghouse, including the raising of the ridge height and the construction of a single storey front/side extension, as well as a first floor cantilever. The remodelling would result in a contemporary style, flat roof, two storey dwellinghouse. The materials used in the developed dwellinghouse would consist primarily of charred timber cladding and grey render. The application also proposes landscaping around the site. \r\rWhilst the proposed development would make significant alterations to both the dwellinghouse and surrounding site and that the proposed front extension would not follow the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposal is well designed. Furthermore, as the surrounding area is characterised by a variety of design types and as such a contemporary design would not appear significantly incongruous. Officers therefore consider that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill SASC constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough. As Officers consider that whilst the architecture proposed would be acceptable, the loss of trees (discussed below) would be harmful to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThere would be no harm to the Area of Archaeological Significance as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application made includes the removal of T.1 & T.2 Atlantic Cedar & T.4 Cedar of Lebanon. These trees are all listed in the Arboricultural Impact Assessment as being Category B trees of very significant size and historically well managed though not without minor issues commonly associated with the species. The trees in question are all subject to a TPO along with others on the site and although the Arb Consultant has taken the position that as a species they are poorly located, there is no greater justification given for their removal. The removal of such significant Cat B protected trees is totally unacceptable simply to facilitate any development much less that of a small residential dwelling and the conclusion must be one of outright refusal.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
