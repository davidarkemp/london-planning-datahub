    "Consultations\r64no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\rNone of relevance.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a four-storey building comprising of 3no. 2-bedroom flats, with undercroft car parking, bicycle storage and refuse/recycling storage. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located to the rear (north) of No.s 5 - 9 Tolworth Broadway, Tolworth. \r\rThe site is a gated piece of land used as an informal rubbish collection area for those properties fronting Tolworth Broadway but is also subject to fly-tipping. \r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area and the site is not in proximity to any statutory or locally listed buildings. \r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r\r- The Principle of the Development;\r- The Standard of Accommodation;\r- Housing Mix;\r- The Character and Appearance of the Area;\r- The Amenities of Neighbouring Occupiers;\r- Transportation;\r- Refuse and Recycling;\r- Sustainability; and \r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\r\rThe principle of creating new residential units within the application area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the proposed dwellings to be 2bedroom, 3person size. \r\rAccording to the standards, dwellings of this size arranged over one storey should have a minimum GIA of 61sqm. All of the proposed dwellings would be below the minimum space standards, providing a total floor area of approximately 52.5sqm. \r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for storage is 2sqm. The proposed dwellings would be provided with approximately 1sqm of storage space, representing undersized space.\r \rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\r\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rThe proposed double bedroom (as labelled) in each flat would not be compliant with these space standards, with each bedroom measuring to 9.5sqm which would in planning terms be considered a single bedroom size. \r\rThe single bedroom (as labelled) in each flat would similarly not be compliant with the minimum space standards for single bedrooms. Officers measure these as 6.5sqm in area, which would not constitute appropriate floor area single bedroom in planning terms.\r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated that 75% of the floorspace of the accommodation would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m, and officers are unable to determine this from the submitted plans.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed units are shown to be triple aspect with windows provided to each side elevation and to the front elevation. \r\rHowever, officers note that the windows to the south elevation would be required to be obscure-glazed and fixed shut to protect the amenity of those flats to the upper levels of No's 5-9 Tolworth Broadway and so would not afford aspect or outlook in this direction. \r\rOfficers find that the proposed development would provide reasonable level of outlook and satisfactory light to the internal accommodation.\r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the Borough's Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rEach of the proposed flats is shown to have access to a private terrace to the front/eastern elevation, measuring to approximately 5sqm.  This would be below Council's guidance for external amenity space for new flats. \r\rIn addition, the proposed development does not include any communal amenity space, which would fail to comply with Policy Guidance 14 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013. \r\rFire Safety\rIn sufficient information with regards to Fire Saftey has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety, in accordance with Policy D12 of the London Plan, 2021. Moderate weight is applied to this level of harm.\r\rOverall\rThe accommodation whilst of a good internal layout and stacking arrangement, the units would fall below the requirements of the nationally described space standards in terms of internal living accommodation, storage space and bedroom sizes. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the ceiling heights would be policy compliant and offer good standard of internal accommodation in this respect. The outdoor amenity space serving all of the proposed flats are considered to represent poor quality amenity areas. \r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would be afforded adequate levels of fire safety.\r\rOverall, officers conclude that the proposals would offer a poor quality standard of accommodation for the three proposed flats. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe application site is to the rear of a commercial parade of three-storey buildings with residential to the first and second floors fronting Tolworth Broadway and which wraps around in a crescent arrangement to front onto Ewell Road. The rear of these buildings is relatively utilitarian, with open landings and external staircases. Immediately adjacent to the application site to the north is an open area of surface car parking, part of which is gated. The aspect to the east of the application site is similarly one of a secondary, servicing nature with a two-storey residential flatted development opposite (known as Chancery House). \r\rThe proposed building would be part brick-facing at ground, first and second floors, with the top floor rendered white. The proposed materiality would generally assimilate well with the surrounding buildings in terms of the proposed facing materials. \r\rOverall, officers consider that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe proposed building would be sited so as to infill between the existing range of buildings fronting Tolworth Broadway extending to three-storeys comprising of ground floor commercial and residential units above, and an open area of surface level car parking to the rear of a three-storey block of flats wrapping around Ewell Road and Tolworth Broadway.\r\rThe submitted proposed block plan is unclear as to the extent of the proposed built footprint in relation to the neighbouring properties. However, it would appear from the proposed floor plan that the extent of the built footprint would occupy most of the width of the site and extend its full depth. \r\rMeasuring from the site location plan, the site is set approximately 20m distance from the rear of those flats which wrap around Ewell Road and Tolworth Broadway, to the north of the site. This separation distance is considered to prevent any significant adverse impact upon the residential amenities of these properties from being affected.\r\rThe proposed development would be sited approximately 5m distance at its maximum (from No. 5 Tolworth Broadway) and approximately 1m (from No's 7-9 Tolworth Broadway). This said, officers note that No's 7-9 benefit from large single-storey rear extensions and that they follow the same building line as the rest of the terrace at first floor level and above, with a distance of approximately 5m from the application site. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have a materially detrimental effect on neighbouring amenity of those occupiers to the flats above No's 7-9 Tolworth Broadway in terms of impact upon outlook and visual dominance. In addition, the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would not give rise to undue daylight/sunlight impacts to those north-facing windows of the flats above No's 7-9 Tolworth Broadway, and officers have concerns that the proposed development would lead to unacceptable loss of light for these neighbouring occupiers. \r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rAccess\rThe vehicular access to the site would remain as existing, utilising the existing dropped kerb. Officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 3, which represents a moderate level of accessibility by means of public transport. Policy 6.1 within Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021 requires the proposed development to have a maximum of 0.75 car parking spaces per dwelling, equating to 2.25 spaces for the three proposed units. \r\rThe proposals show two undercroft car parking spaces. In this way, the proposals would be acceptable in terms of car parking provision, in accordance with maximum parking standards set out in Policy 6.1 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards.\r\rDevelopment proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for minimum of 6no. cycle parking spaces. A cycle enclosure is shown in the undercroft area with storage capacity for 4no. cycles. The quantum would not be in line with minimum cycle standards set out in policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rThe plans show that the waste and recycling bins will be stored within the undercroft area to the application site. It is noted that secondary door and means of access to the perimeter of the building for access/transfer of the bins to the highway. This store is within approximately 10m of the highway to Douglas Road and would, as such, be within the specified dragging distance for Council operatives to collect the bins. \r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2021 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy SI2 of the London Plan 2021 requires all new major developments to be zero carbon. However, it does not set any requirements for minor developments.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency and CO2 reductions. \r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. \r\rThe development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 4, for which the charge is £50 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5 year housing supply. \r\rThe proposed development would provide 3no. net additional market housing units, all of which would be 2-bedroom units. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rOfficers find that the proposed development would provide for poor quality living accommodation in terms of undersized floor areas, lack of storage space and undersized bedroom areas. In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the ceiling heights to each proposed flat would comply with London Plan standards. External amenity space whilst acknowledged would be directly provided for each flat, would, however, be undersized and no communal amenity provision is included as part of the scheme. Officers assign significant weighting against the proposals to the quality of the accommodation in the overall assessment.\r\rThe proposals have been assessed as acceptable in terms of impact to the character and appearance of the area and in terms of highways. These matters are given neutral weighting in the planning balancing exercise. \r\rThere is inadequate cycle storage to serve the proposed development. This is assigned moderate weighting against the proposals. \r\rIn terms of impact upon neighbouring amenity, the proposals are considered to result in harm to the amenity of those flats above No's 7-9 Tolworth Broadway in terms of impact upon outlook and visual dominance, given the proposed siting and scale of the proposed development. In addition, the applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would allow for adequate daylight/sunlight penetration to the neighbouring flats at No's 7-9 Tolworth Broadway. Officers afford significant weighting against the proposals to this matter in the overall planning balancing exercise. \r\rThe proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and it is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the provision of three 2-bedroom flats in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rIt is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \r",
