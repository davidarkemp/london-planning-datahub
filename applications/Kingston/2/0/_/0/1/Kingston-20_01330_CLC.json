    "On the basis of the limited information that has been submitted, it is has not been satisfactorily demonstrated that the development would not not increase flood risk elsewhere, contrary the National Planning Policy Framework, Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and DM4 of the adopted Core Strategy (2013).",
    "Application Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi-detached house. The site is located in an area identified as being at 'High Risk' of surface water flooding by the Environment Agency.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for amendments to existing rear ground floor extension, new windows and juliet balconies to side elevation, demolition of existing garage and replacement with store, removal of existing wall and garden access and replacement with new, single-storey dog grooming area, new flood gate, first floor bathroom bay window replaced with a new bay window and the removal of 2no existing chimney stacks\r\rRepresentations\r7x surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. 2x letters of objection have been received from one address and the following concerns highlighted:-\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Loss of outlook undue sense of enclosure and an overbearing appearance and give the \"feeling of being overlooked\"\r- Car park issues\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r\rRelevant Planning History\r10/14597/LDP - Formation of hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer to facilitate loft conversion (LDC(P))- GRANTED 12.10.2010\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and building; and,\r- Impact on surface water flooding\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the host dwelling at the end of Bakewell Way, officers consider that the proposed development would not appear overly prominent within the streetscene and would not be detrimental to the character and appearance of the host property or the wider area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposals to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed dog grooming facility and storage area would be built along the shared boundary with adjoining No. 19 Bakwell Way at a height of approxiamtely 2.895m and a depth of approximately 6m. It is noted that the shared boundary with No. 19 angles across the rear elevation of No. 19 such that the proposed dog grooming building would be sited directly opposite rear facing habitable room windows and amenity space. It is considered that the dog grooming building would have an unacceptable overbearing impact, loss of outlook and result in an undue sense of enclosure to the owner/occupiers of No. 19 Bakewell Way.\r\rIn terms of overlooking and loss of privacy, the proposed juliet balconies to the side elevation would directly overlook a medical centre to the south-west. As a non-residential use, it is not considered that any increased overlooking to this neighbouring site would have any significant adverse impact in terms of levels of privacy.\r\rThe applicant has confirmed by email dated 16.05.2022 that the proposed dog grooming building would be for private use only and that there would be no visitors. A planning condition could be used to ensure that the use of the dog grooming building is for the use of the householder only and is not used as a business. Nonetheless, given the proximity of the proposed dog grooming building to neighbours it is considered that further information about the proposed use, including details of any mechanical ventilation and equipment, would be required to fully assess the potential impact of this building and use within on neighbouring amenity. As such, it has not been demonstrated through the submission of sufficient information that the proposed dog grooming building would not result in unacceptable levels of noise.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, undue sense of enclosure and overbearing impact on the owner/occupiers of No. 19 and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed dog grooming building would not result in unacceptable noise and nuisance to No. 19 Bakewell Way.\r\rFlood Risk & Drainage\r\rParagraph 167 of the NPPF (2021) sets out that when determining planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere.\r\rThe submitted 'Proposed Ground Floor Plan' show 2x new flood gates fronting onto Bakewell Way while the 'Proposed Balcony & Flood Gate' drawing shows details of a new brick wall and some detailing of a rubber sealing for the new proprietary flood gate. No Flood Risk Assessment or other details have been submitted with the application.\r\rWhile not located within a fluvial flood zone, the site and much of Bakewell Way and the wider area is identified as being at medium-high risk of surface water flooding. While the proposed flood gates could potentially prevent surface water flooding to the front garden of the application site, it has not been demonstrated where the displaced surface water would go. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not increase surface water flood risk elsewhere and  would not increase surface water flooding to neighbouring properties.\r\rConclusion\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would have an uancceptable adverse impact on the amenities of No. 19 Bakewell Way and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not increase surface water flood risk elsewhere. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.",
