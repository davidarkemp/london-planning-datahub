Officers acknowledge that this would not respect the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD. The proposed first-floor extension would appear disproportionate, not subordinate to the existing dwellinghouse and would be highly prominent within the street scene due to the corner plot location and position forward of the established building line along Station Road. \r\rThe proposed ground floor rear extension would have a depth of approximately 3.5m and a total flat roof height of approximately 2.7m. Whilst officers acknowledge that the flat roof would not respect the pitched roof form of the host dwelling, it is considered that the proposal would, in isolation, appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host building.\r\rIn regards to the proposed change of material from brick to render and the roof to grey slate, officers consider it would not significantly affect the character and appearance in the wider area, as it would not be incongruous in the vicinity of Station Road. However, it would adversely impact the symmetry shared with adjoining neighbouring property, as No. 12 Station Road has a brick finish.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi-detached building.\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the conversion of garage into habitable space and erection of single storey side extension. Changes to ground floor fenestrations.\r\rConsultation \r6no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representation received.\r\rPlanning History\r23/00431/HOU - Conversion of garage into habitable space and erection of single storey side/rear extension. Granted planning permission, dated 28.03.2023.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Impact upon Highways; and\r- Fire Safety\r \rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposals seek to convert the integral garage into a habitable space (bedroom with en-suite) with associated change from existing garage door to a window of a similar appearance to the existing main windows within the front elevation of the property. This is considered to be an acceptable alteration which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed single-storey side extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe proposals involve the erection of a modest side extension to the rear of the existing garage to the same width as the garage and to a depth to join the existing rear building line of the dwellinghouse. The extension would have a part flat, part pitched roof form. \r\rThe proposed extension is considered minor in its scale and appropriate in its design, in keeping with the host building. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe conversion of the garage, proposed side extension and alterations to the fenestration would not cause any materially harmful impacts to neighbouring amenity.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space. The garage is not capable of fitting a modern car. \r\rThe area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used for car parking.\r\rAs such, the conversion would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole.

No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended set in distances, however considering the proposed bulk and mass of the extension and the proposed design, it is considered to appear in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is noted that the property benefits from permitted development rights with regards to roof extensions and therefore it can be considered as a 'fallback' position in respect of the mass and bulk and siting of the proposed roof extensions. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would not be directly visible within the street view, as such it would not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. The proposed front roof lights and hip to gable roof extension is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed materials (roof tiles and render) would be of similar appearance to the existing materials. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

Removal of front catslide. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The applicant previously submitted an application which slightly differs from the submitted proposal. The changes include the removal of the front cat-slide roof feature and the removal of the partial pitched roof to the single storey rear/side extension to a flat roof. \r\rThe removal of the cat-slide roof would not usually be acceptable as they are a distinct feature found in Motspur Park. However, the removal of this feature would not cause significant harm to the character and appearance of the wider area as No.55 Motspur Park has also removed the cat-slide feature.\r\rThe application partly proposes the construction of a two-storey side extension. The proposed two storey side extension would be set down from the ridge line of the existing dwelling house by approximately 0.7 metres, and set back sufficiently from the front elevation by approximately 1 metre. Additionally, this extension would not exceed 50% of the width of the original house. Officers note that this element would be set in from the boundary by approximately 0.8 metres. Whilst this aspect would not strictly meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD 2013, which requires two-storey side extensions to be set in from the boundary by at least 1 metre to ensure a terracing effect does not occur, this would not warrant refusal alone as overall it would be a subordinate and proportionate addition. This element is therefore considered to have an acceptable impact in terms of character and appearance.\r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a part two-storey rear extension. Whilst this element of the proposal would be of a significant scale, as it sited to the rear of the dwelling and would not be clearly visible from the streetscene, officers consider that it would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rRegarding the construction of a porch area and alterations to an existing detached garage to the rear, officers consider these elements of the proposal to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse.\rFinally the application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension with a flat roof. Whilst this extension would exceed the recommended depth and height for single storey rear extensions, it would appear proportionate to the the host dwelling.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed changes to roof tiles, render colour, window frame colour and minor changes to front porch would not generally be features that are similar to the host dwelling or most dwelling in the vicinty of Motspur Park. However, the roof tile change from red/brown slate to grey slate and the proposed white render would not be incongruous as a few dwellings on Motspor Park do have grey tile. The existing white UPVC window frames into Dark Grey UPVC and the porch rearrangement would be different in the streetscene but is not considered to have any significant adverse impact.\r\rTherefore, on balance, officers consider that the proposed would still appear proportionate to the original dwellinghouse and would therefore have an acceptable impact on its character and appearance. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 55 and No. 59 Motspur Park. \r\rIn relation to No. 55 Motspur Park, the application proposes a number of windows on the side elevation of the main dwelling. In the event of an approval Officers consider that a condition to ensure that these windows are obscure glazed would be required, in the interest of protecting the privacy of neighbouring properties. Subject to the satisfaction of such a condition Officers consider that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of the neighbouring property at No. 55 Motspur Park in terms of loss of privacy. Similarly, Officers consider that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of this neighbouring property through loss of sunlight or an overbearing appearance. \r\rIn relation to No. 59 Motspur Park, the application proposes the installation of two windows on the side elevation of the detached garage. These windows would be at ground level and would face the neighbouring property at 59 Motspur Park. Officers consider that these windows are sited sufficiently far away from the boundary of this neighbouring property, and at a low enough level, for this element to not have a detrimental impact on the privacy of this neighbouring property. \r\rIn relation to sunlight, an application at this site was previously refused as the applicant had failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed 1st floor rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on daylight/sunlight and the outlook of the closest habitable room windows at neighbouring property No. 59 Motspur Park. \r\rDue to the set in from the boundary of the proposed development, as well as the existence of an alleyway between these two properties (No.59 Motspur Park), and that the ground floor habitable room at this neighbouring property benefits from a number of windows, Officers consider that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of No. 59 Motspur Park by reason of loss of sunlight. Similarly, Officers do not consider the proposed would result in an overbearing impact.  \r\rHighways\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable room. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site. \r\rFurthermore, it is considered that the remaining hardstanding is of an adequate size to accommodate two off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue would not warrant a reason for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would result in a loss of access to the rear as well as the loss of a garage. Officers therefore consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the application in the event of an approval for the applicant to provide details of secure onsite cycle parking. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rIt is noted that this is an infill extension which will be the same depth as the existing partial single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Flood Risk; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the existing situation between the neighbouring properties to either side of the development, no further harm has been identified. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk information supplied indicate a very low risk of surface flooding. Floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling. Floor levels will be subject to a condition should permission be granted. overall, the proposed development is considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension. Increase in roof height, erection of rear piggyback roof extension and installation of 5nos side rooflights. Insulation on external wall.\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed piggyback extension resulting in a raised right height is compliant with Policy Guidance 40 of the Residential Design SPD as it has been set back from the front elevation by at lease 4m and the does not increase the height by more than 1.3m. Officers also note there are several examples of piggyback extension within the street and surrounding area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to the piggyback roof extension, as this would not extend beyond the original rear elevation, officers have not identified any harm with regards to further loss of light. The proposed rooflight should be obscured glazing in order to mitigate light pollution and provided an element of privacy from overlooking. This would be secured by condition should permission be granted. With regards to the proposed single storey rear extension, Officers note that both neighbouring properties benefit from single storey rear extension. There are also examples of deeper extensions within the streetscene. For this reason, under Policy Guidance 33 although extensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth, If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line then the depth of the extension could be increased. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of two-storey side extension, alterations to front and rear fenestrations, and internal alterations\r\rThis application follows recently refused application 23/00792/HOU dated 19.05.2023 for the erection of two-storey side extension, alterations to front and rear fenestrations, and internal alterations. This application was refused for the following reason;\r\r1) Due to its excessive depth and height along the shared boundary, the proposed extension would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and overbearing impact to No. 3 Lord Chancellor Walk, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rThis reason for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful.\r\rConsultation\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating:\r- shadows shown for winter equinox are incorrect.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: From a character and design perspective, the proposed development it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is also considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and therefore, no adverse impacts on Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neighbouring amenity, Officers note that the proposed height of the extension has been decreased from 7.5m to 6m. However, The proposed two storey side extension would still be deep with a depth of approximately 12.5m in very close proximity to the shared boundary with No. 3 Lord Chancellor Walk. It would be set in 1m from the boundary at to begin with but this separation decreases along the length of the boundary.\r\rDue to the excessive height in close proximity to the shared boundary with No. 3, and considering that the extension would project beyond the rear elevation of No. 3 by approximately 13m, officers still consider that the proposed extension would be overbearing and unneighbourly in relation to No. 3 Lord Chancellor Walk, and would result in an undue sense of enclosure. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing impact/ sense of enclosure.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: While no Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021), Officers consider that the proposal should be able to meet the requirements of Policy D12(A). Were the application otherwise acceptable, a Fire Strategy would be secured by way of a planning condition. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "23/01419/FUL\r\rApplication Site\rThe site relates to the Kingston University Penrhyn Road campus, which comprises a range of buildings across the site.\r\rThe Grove Crescent Conservation Area lies to the north and east  of the site. There  are various listed and locally listed Buildings in the vicinity.\r\rThere are numerous trees on the site covered byTree Preservation Order.\rThe site is within Flood Zone 1 (Low risk)\rThe Site is within the Kingston Town Centre Action Area Plan boundary. \rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of ranginging between 3 and 4 and is well served by public transport.\r\rProposal\rThe proposed alterations are to the main entrance on the western facade fronting Penrhyn Road. There are two main elements:\r(i) Remodelling of the main Penrhyn Road entrance door to provide a new entrance with revolving door and canopy, signage and associated development;\r (ii) the erection of a new passenger lift within an internal courtyard (with lift overrun) immediately off the Penrhyn Road main entrance foyer \r\rConsultation\rThe proposal was advertised by means of 4 site notices displayed at or near the site of proposed works. No comments have been received.\rGLAAS: the proposal is unlikely to have a significant effect on heritage assets of archaeological interest.The planning application is not in an Archaeological Priority Area. No further assessment or conditions are therefore necessary.  \rTree Officer - original concerns about potential loss of trees addressed. As no loss of trees is proposed there is no objection to the proposal.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- Heritage\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\r\rPrinciple of development\rCore Strategy Policy CS15 relates to the Future Needs of Kingston University and states that  The Council will continue to work in partnership with Kingston University recognising their importance in the local economy, to identify appropriate opportunities, including on their existing sites, to meet their needs for new and upgraded facilities and for smarter travel initiatives, including travel planning. \r\rTherefore, subject to compliance with other policies, the proposal would be supported in principle.\r\rDesign\rParagraph 124 of the NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities. \r\rParagraph 127 goes on to say that planning decisions should ensure that developments: will function well and add to the overall quality of the area; are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; are sympathetic to local character and history; and establish a strong sense of place.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed entrance would be  in the form of a glazed curtain walling system that is gently recessed into the building, which it is advised has taken  inspiration from the original building design (prior to its remodelling in the 200's, which gives relief to the facade and allows the original columns to be expressed. A revolving door is proposed, and a slimline canopy above. The proposed works to the entrance to the Unversity  would help to  create a more legible entrance feature and an enhanced arrival experience. It is concluded that the alterations would enhance the appearance of the building.\rThe lift would be concealed within the building as it is located within an internal courtyard. A  lift overrun  of  very modest scale (900 mm height) is set well back from the front facade and would not be prominent in views. \rThe proposal is considered to be acceptable in terms of its detailed design and appearance. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                     Paragraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment: \rThe Grade II listed 1893 landmark building of County Hall lies to the north-west of the campus on Penrhyn Road. To the east of the campus on Grove Lane is the Grade II listed 1872 Church of St John. \rThe Grove Crescent Conservation area lies to the north and east  of the campus buildings.\r\rThe Main Building's entrance on the west façade is  located towards the southern end of the building and set back from the road frontage and therefore not readily visible from the Grove Crescent Conservation Area (GCCA). \rThe entrance  lies to the south and west of the Grade II* listed County Hall building   and is not within the immediate setting of the listed building. The proposed external lift will be screened on all sides by the Main Building and Clattern Lecture Theatre which surround the courtyard. The overrun protrudes marginally above the building line and as noted above, due to the set back would not readily visible from surrounding streets. \rOverall, it is concluded that the proposal would not result in any material harm to the setting of heritage assets. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicies at a national, regional, and local level direct that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to  the nature of the works, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, noise or disturbance orloss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\rPolicy D12 of The London Plan states: a)   In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all     development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure   that they: \r1) Identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: a) For fire appliances to be positioned on. b) Appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point. \r2) Are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures. \r3) Are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread. \r4) Provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users.\r5) Develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in. 6) Provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Statement prepared by Osborn Associates.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). \rThe lift will also be allocated as an evacuation lift as per the requirements of London Plan Policy D5.\rOngoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy states that the Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Where trees are to be lost through development the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost.\rWhilst the submitted drawings are unclear, the applicant has confirmed that proposal does not involve the removal of any trees or changes. On this basis, this is acceptable and secured by condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance  with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling which has been in use as two separate flats since circa 1985.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and changes to side fenestration of the ground floor flat.\r\rConsultation\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Standard of Accommodation;\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would result in the loss of the majority of the current amenity space provided for the ground floor flat. This area can been seen as a separate fenced off area within the site photos.  However, the submitted existing and proposed drawings do not show the separate amenity spaces or how they would be affected by the proposed development.\r\rOn the basis of the submitted information, it is considered that the proposals would result in a significant loss of  private amenity space for the ground floor flat which would detract from the standard of accommodation. It is considered that the overall standard of accommodation would bepoor and, for this reason, the proposal is contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021, Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013). \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension, in isolation, is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal property to be considered with regards to neighbouring amenity is No. 27a Westbury Road. Officers note the presence of the existing rear extension hard up against the boundary with No. 27 the proposed extnsion in width would not further harm the current situation. It is considered therefore, that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling that currently benefits from a rear dormer loft conversion.\r\rProposal\rInstallation of solar panels on loft roof and rear extension roof\r\rConsultation\r8 neighbouring properties have been notifed and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed plans show conflicting and inconsistant information relating to both the set down of the existing rear dormer and the number of solar panels displayed on the proposed roof plan. The proposed rear elevation shows the rear dormer as set down from the original ridge height but the proposed side elevations do not show this set down. With regards to the solar panels, the side elevations depicts 4 solar panel that are stood upright but the proposed roof plan shows what appears to be two large solar panels. Due to inconsistencies in the submission, Officers are unable to conclude that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, and design and that it would not result in an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

    "SuDS are proposed in the form of an underground cellular attenuation tank, providing a storage volume of 24 m3 has been proposed to contribute to the sustainable drainage of the site. However, it is not clear the discharge rate of the drainage system being proposed nor if the storage volume provided is sufficient to ensure that the drainage system does not flood in a 1 in 30 year rainfall event. The applicant should confirm the discharge rates being proposed. Also, drainage calculations are required to support the currently proposed drainage strategy.\r\rThe applicant should provide calculations to demonstrate that the proposed drainage system can contain up to the 1 in 30 storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event should be safely contained on site. These calculations must include details of critical storm durations and demonstrate how the proposed system as a whole will function during different storm events.\r\rIf any flooding occurs for the 1 in 100 year plus 40% climate change event, then details of where this flooding will occur and the volume of the flooding are required to demonstrate the site will remain safe.\r\rAlso, a maintenance schedule for the surface water drainage system needs to be provided to include the maintenance tasks and frequency of the proposed drainage components.
