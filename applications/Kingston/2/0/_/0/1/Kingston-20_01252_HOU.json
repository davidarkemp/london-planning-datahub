    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at numbers 86 and 88  Devon Way, Chessington KT9 2RJ. The proposed rear dormer extension, by virtue of its design, size and bulk, would fail to appear as a subservient addition. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 and paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The applicant is reminded that implementing this development in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful. This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. The applicant is strongly advised to seek further advice before proceeding with any approval.\r",
    "The application form proposes 2 front rooflights, however the Proposed Front Elevation plan is annotated with 3 front rooflights. Please confirm the number of rooflights being proposed and amend the annotation if necessary."
