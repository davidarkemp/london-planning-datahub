    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rPlanning History\r22/01648/CPU- Erection of hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 2 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. GRANTED 12.07.2022.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Car parking; \r- Flood risk and drainage; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would be set back from the front elevation of the main dwelling and the ridge of the roof of  the proposed extension, would be set down in relation to the main dwelling. However, the first floor side extension would not be set in from the shared boundary, which would not conform to the relevant guideline of one metre within the Residential Design SPD.  Planning permission ref: 13/10235/HOU at No.7 Vallis Way, the adjoining semi-detached property, maintained a set-in at the first floor level of 0.5m from the site boundary. The proposal at No. 5 has no set-in and, were the corresponding neighbours to extend in a similar way, would result in a terracing effect. Given also that the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in this part of Vallis Way, are largely retained at first floor level. The proposed development would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling by eroding gaps between neighbouring properties and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene and surrounding area.\r\rResidential Design SPD Policy Guidance 33 for rear extensions, states that single storey extensions proposed with a flat roof should not exceed 3.5m in depth or 3m in height. In this case, the full width rear extension would project 4.08 metres from the rear of the original dwellinghouse, with a flat roof 3.0 metres in height. The extension would align No.7 Vallis Way and would be in keeping with SPD policy guidance 33 (residential single storey extensions) and respects the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor extension would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD as mentioned above, given the separation from the proposed development and flank wall of the neighbouring property, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevation, it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The full width rear extension would project 4.08 metres from the rear of the original dwellinghouse. However, it would be set away from the neighbouring property at No.3 Vallis Way and as such, the proposed ground floor rear extension would have no significant impact in terms of overbearing impact, loss of outlook, sunlight/daylight or visual intrusion.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rThe proposed development would result in the loss of the car parking space within the existing garage.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 2. The applicant has submitted a site-specific flood risk assessment which sets out that floor levels within the extensions will be set no lower than existing in order to mitigate the risk of flooding to occupiers of the development. Officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on flood risk would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, by reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No.3 Vallis Way, the proposed first floor side extension would appear as a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, erode the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in Vallis Way and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Proposed Block Plan - this proposal is for Change of Use, but the Proposed Block Plan shows a proposed extension. For the avoidance of doubt, please check and amend the plan to be consistent with the current proposal."
