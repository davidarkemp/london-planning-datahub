    "Application Site\r\rThis application relates to a ground floor commercial unit fronting Clarence Street forming part of the Rotunda Centre, Kingston Upon Thames.\r\rThe Rotunda Centre is closely associated with the Grade II listed Bentalls Depository building and is also near to 154-156 Clarence Street which is a Grade II listed building. \r\rThe following constraints are also relevant:\rArea of Archaeological Significance\rArticle 4 Area\rCPZ\rKingston Town Centre Key Area of Change\rKey Views\rFlood Zone 2 (medium probability) \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks advertisement consent for the display of replacement signage of 1no. internally illuminated Fascia sign, 1no. internally illuminated projecting sign and 1no. wall mounted neon sign.\r\rCONSULTATIONS\rA Site Notice was placed and an advert was placed in the local newspaper notifying of the application. No responses were received. \r\rRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No objections\rHistoric England: No comments.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issue to assess in the consideration of this application is the impact that the development would have on the character of the area and the streetscene and impact upon heritage assets and impact upon highway safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rParagraph 136 of the NPPF states that the quality and character of places can suffer when advertisements are poorly sited and designed. A separate consent process within the planning system controls the display of advertisements, which should be operated in a way which is simple, efficient and effective. Advertisements should be subject to control only in the interests of amenity and public safety, taking account of cumulative impacts. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe Council's Supplementary Planning Document titled, \"Shopfronts and Shopsigns\" (2005) provides guidance on new shopfronts and signage (including projecting and illuminated). \r\rThe proposals include the installation of illuminated replacement fascia signage to the front elevation, an illuminated projecting sign and a wall mounted neon sign. \r\rThe proposed fascia sign would comprise of white lettering fixed to a dark blue aluminium fascia board with timber edging. The fascia and signage is appropriately scaled in comparison to the existing building and surrounding advertising and is the same size as the existing fascia. \r\rThe projecting sign comprises of printed dibond panel with a concrete effect and an iron logo in addition to the public house name hanging sign below. It projects approx. 0.9m beyond the fascia and is 2.4m above ground level.\r\rThe proposed wall mounted sign is 1.5m x 1.7m and comprises of a metal mesh with a logo and LED lighting affixed to a timber board. This would replace an existing wall mounted sign. \r\rThe levels of illumination to the signage would not create any significant light pollution.\r\rThe proposed signage will introduce a change to the style and materials of advertising to the building currently and that in the surrounding area. However, this is not considered visually unobtrusive in this town centre location and is considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene, thereby complying with Policy DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\r\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe application site is closely associated with the Bentalls Depository Grade II listed building but the proposed works are not considered to affect the significance of the heritage asset. Given the separation from the nearby 154-156 Clarence Street and the modest nature of the changes in this town centre location, the proposal is not considered to harm the significance of this listed building either.  \r\rHighway Safety\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree. \r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rLocal Planning Authorities are expected to have regard to its effect upon the safe use and operation of any form of traffic or transport on land (including the safety of pedestrians), on or over water, or in the air. Public safety considerations, the second arm of control over advertisements, do not arise very frequently. However, when it can be shown that signs would be confused with traffic signals or the visibility of drivers is impaired, a solid and sustainable ground for refusal of Advertisement Regulation consent is provided. \r\rThe signage would be illuminated but given the low level illuminance and the context of this town centre location and relationship to the highway, it would not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety.  Similarly, the hanging sign would not conflict with or impede the free-flow of pedestrian or vehicular movement or create a distraction to highway users. The proposed signage is therefore in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposed signage is considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene and would not result in harm to the significance of nearby Grade II listed buildings / heritage assets. The proposal therefore complies with Policy DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rThe proposals would not have any material effect on highway safety. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which otherwise indicate that advertisement consent should be refused. Therefore, it is recommended that advertisement consent be granted. \r\rRecommendation \rThat advertisement consent should be GRANTED.\r",
