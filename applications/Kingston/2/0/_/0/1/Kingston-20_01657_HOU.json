    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the proposed materials stated on the application form/plans, the exterior facing materials to be used in the development hereby approved shall be similar in appearance to those used in the existing house.    \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the north west elevation wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The flat parts of the roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

The proposed conversion would therefore require planning permission.",
    "The application site is located on the eastern side of Coombe Road and previously comprised a large detached bungalow. \r\rPlanning permission was granted (18/14294/FUL) on 30th May 2018 for 2 no. detached dwellings. This was followed by a s73 application to vary the approved permission (20/01970/FUL) granted on 18.11.2020. The development has since commenced.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area or a Local or Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rThe site is a TPO Area and within Flood Zone 1. \r\r22 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received with the following comments made:\r- Impact on trees / TPOs\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rNetwork Traffic Engineer:\r\rNo objections.\r\rThe creation of the relocated crossover is subject to a separate Crossover application.\r\rThe redundant crossover must be removed and the kerb reinstated at the applicant's expense.\r\rThe parking layout and visibility splays are considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The principle of the development; \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Impact on trees\r\rPrinciple of Development\r\rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land by varying or removing conditions previously attached. In this case, the application is to vary Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission 20/01970/FUL.\r\rWhile this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development was nonetheless established by the granting of 18/14294/FUL (and following that 20/01970/FUL) and Section 73(2) of the Act explicitly states that \"on such an application, the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which permission should be granted\". It would therefore, be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application. The principle of development is therefore accepted.\r\rDesign\rThe proposal includes an amended parking layout and relocation of vehicle crossover and electric gate.  In comparison to the previous site layout, the entrance gate is set further back into the site and the changes will allow increased landscaping at the front of the site which is supported. Overall, these changes are considered acceptable and will have no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area. \r\rThe proposed changes are also consistent with the details approved through 22/01721/FUL.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rThe proposal is not considered to raise any new matters not already considered through the parent permission/s. As such, the proposal is not considered to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rThe proposal includes re-arranged vehicular access arrangements and parking layout. The overall level of parking remains the same. \r\rThe Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer is satisfied that the re-arranged access and parking layout will ensure acceptable pedestrian visibility splays and allow vehicles to safely enter and egress the site. \r\rThe proposal is therefore not considered to result in an unacceptable impact upon highway safety or the local highway network, thereby achieving compliance with the NPPF and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rImpact on Trees\rA Tree Report has submitted with this application. As a result of the proposed works, the vehicular parking to the south of the site will be moved further out of the RPA of T1 (Copper Beach), which falls under the TPO Area, and T4 (Monkey Puzzle) which is not a TPO. \r\rThe Council's Tree and Landscaping Officer is satisfied that the proposal will not result in additional harm to the health of the trees on and adjacent to the site. The proposal is therefore in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan and DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rConclusion\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to conditions. \r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey detached dwelling within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The special architectural and historic interest of the Coombe Wood Conservation Area can be summarised as: Large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course. The site adjoins the site of The pavillion which is a Grade II listed building (listing 1329898) A Private house and attached garden wall to west. Designed 1958, built 1959-60 by Oliver Hill, This is a rare and important example of a late work by one of the leading English architects of the mid-century, and it reflects the interest in eighteenth-century garden pavilion design found in the 1950s. There is a blanket Tree protection order (TPO) which covers the site.\r\rProposal\rErection of mansard roof extension with 1no front, 1no rear and 1no side dormer above existing garage including new external access stair to create home office.\r\rConsultation\r6 Surrounding properties have been notified and 2 objections from one address have been received stating;\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r\rA query has also been raised with relation to development outside the boundary of the site. An informative will be added should permission be granted reminding the applicant of there legal responsibilities regarding boundaries.\r\rHistoric England Archaeology - No comment to raise\r\rMaldens and Coombe CAAC - No objection - given the development is not seen from the street the impact on the CA is minimal\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the Coombe Wood Conservation Area & Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character;\r- The impact of the development on trees; and,\r- The impact of the development on the fire safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed roof extension on the existing garage would be constructed in matching materials to the main house. Overall, due to its location and lack of visibility with regards to the grade II listed building on the adjoining site, The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. The applicant is reminded that permission has not been granted for use as a separate unit of accommodation and should permission be granted, a condition requiring the use to remain ancillary to the main house would be applied.\r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the location of the proposed extension coupled with the distance between neighbouring sites, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the location of the proposal to the rear of the property, officers consider that the proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of Coombe Wood Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and would not cause any harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset. Since no harm has been identified it is not necessary to weigh the proposal against any public benefit.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD, 2013 provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment: There is no loss of trees proposed and no development would be in close proximity to the roots of a TPO tree.  Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The Proposed Site Plan no. 21_WC-E.SP is titled \"Location and Existing Site Plan\". For the avoidance of doubt please correct the plan title.",
    "Inconsistent Plans - the Description and Proposed Roof Plan indicates four proposed rooflights, but the Proposed Side Elevation Plan no. 21_WC-P.E.03 shows one rooflight on that side. Please amend plans for consistency.",
