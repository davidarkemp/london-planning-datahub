    "By virtue of its cumulative size, scale and bulk, it is considered that the proposed development would fail to respect the characteristics of the original host dwelling and would erode the visual separation gap between the adjacent neighbouring properties.  Additionally, the design of the proposed truncated roof form, coupled with the mismatched window styles in the front elevation of the property, would result in an incongruous form of development. As a result, the proposal would have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and the objectives of the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 \r(as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the approved scheme by: \rAlterations to fenestration at first floor level, \rReplacing painted brickwork with dark timber cladding;\rReduction in the number of news skylights from 5 to 3.\r\rIn this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposed changes are considered not to be non-material.\r",
