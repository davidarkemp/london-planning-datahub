    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The finished floor levels of the extension hereby approved shall be no lower than the finished floor levels in the existing dwellinghouse. \r\rReason: To mitigate against potential flood risk in compliance with Policy DM4 (Water Management and Flood Risk) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",

    "A1 - Loading",
    "The proposed extension by virtue of its size, siting & design in close proximity to the side adjoining shared boundaries would be likely to create a dominant and overbearing feature that would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure and be harmful to the outlook of the neighbouring occupiers.",
    "The submitted floor plans do not have a North point.\r\rPlease provide existing and proposed floor plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
