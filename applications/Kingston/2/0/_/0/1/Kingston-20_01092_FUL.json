    "The proposed development, by reason of the loss of the existing front garden in favour of car parking and the scale, siting, bulk, mass, form and design of the extensions, would visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at 7 and 8 Cleaveland Road and disrupt the established pattern of development along the street, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character, appearance and historic significance of the area, contrary to policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed additional car parking space would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety, contrary to policies CS7 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The information submitted has been assessed and it is concluded that it does not contain the necessary evidence in sufficient detail or clarity to allow the discharge of the condition.",
    "If you have evidence to contradict the local planning authority's assessment of the application, you are encouraged to apply for the development again and include that evidence in support of the application.",
    "The submitted elevations are not labelled as existing or proposed.\r\rElevations: Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged.",
    "The submitted application form does not have an email address, please confirm the email address 'orders@surefireprint.co.uk' can be used for any correspondence."
