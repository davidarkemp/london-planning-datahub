    "The proposed extensions by reason of their scale and siting would result in an undue sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to a principal habitable room window at neighbouring No. 45 Montem Road and appear over bearing for the occupants of both No. 45 & 49 Montem Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its scale, would  relate poorly to the host property, appearing as an incongruous feature resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r",
    "Please provide Proposed Roof Plan at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions of the proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged.",
    "The red outline in the location plan and site plan are different, please amend the location plan and site plan with the correct red outline."
