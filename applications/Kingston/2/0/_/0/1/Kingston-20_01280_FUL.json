    "Cumulatively, the installation of a mounted video display within the shop window and the insufficient information submitted in relation to the fascia signage and hanging sign are considered to result in less than substantial harm and would fail to either preserve or enhance the host building, the character and appearance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the following heritage assets:\r-Nos. 13-15 Church Street; \r-All Saints Church; \r-Kingston upon Thames War Memorial; and,\r-Nos 14-15 Church Street.\r  This harm would not be outweighed by any public benefit.\r\rAs such the proposal would fail the tests set out in Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraph 196 of the NPPF, 2019, Policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan, 2016 and Policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use \r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRelevant History - \r22/00218/HOU - Demolition of existing detached garage and erection of replacement single-storey detached annex for ancillary use - Refuse on 20 Mar 2022\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- FIre Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Although the proposal has reduced in size from previously refused application 22/00218/HOU, the prosposal would still appear dominant and disproportionate in relation to the size of the host dwelling. Additionally, the proposed use is not considered to be for ancillary use to the host building and is capable of being used as a separate dwelling. Therefore, officers consider that the proposal would be incongruous and have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed annex, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
