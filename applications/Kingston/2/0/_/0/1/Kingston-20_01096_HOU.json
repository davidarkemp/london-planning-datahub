    "\rThe site comprises a  two storey detached dwelling located on the northern side of Bearfield Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for raising the roof ridge height with erection of 2no side dormer roof extensions and installation of 3no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rThe proposal follows a refused scheme 22/00286/HOU for the following reason:\r\r\"The proposed development, by virtue of its scale, siting and absence of a setback from the front elevation would create a dominant and incongruous addition which would be visually prominent within the streetscene. This would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the visual amenities of the surrounding area, conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Councils LDF Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013). \r\rIt is also noted that the submitted drawings (artist impression) do not accurately reflect the neighbouring extension at No.5 Bearfield Road.\"\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received objecting to the development on the following grounds:\r\rOverlooking and loss of privacy to properties in Windsor Road;\rDesign, appearance and materials - excessive bulk and height not reflective of the overall street scene;\rImpact on traffic and loss of parking;\rNoise and disturbance;\rA piggyback extension would be more appropriate.\r\rGiven the nature of the development, any impact on traffic and parking would be temporary in nature and relevant permits and licences required for any use of the road/footpath. Similarly, noise and disturbance would be temporary and limited to permitted hours for construction work. All other matters will be addressed in the assessment of the proposal.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed roof extensions are not in accordance with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD, and in particular Policy Guidance 39 however the development would mostly match that of the neighbouring property at No.5 Bearfield Road, but would be slightly deeper to the rear.\r\rOfficers note the neighbouring development at No.5 Bearfield was the subject of an appeal that was allowed (APP/Z5630/D/17/3189671) and that other examples of similar roof extensions have taken place at a number of other properties within the road, including larger 'matching' roof additions at No.18 and 20 opposite. \r\rIt was the inspector's view that the existing roof alterations have 'altered the original and traditional roofscape of the road, such that they now form part of the character of the street' and 'that the dormers could not be said to be out of character with the wider street scene, albeit they are not wholly sympathetic to the form and character of the host dwelling.' It was further cited that the setback from the front elevation of the property was a reason for deeming the proposed roof dormers acceptable and in this case the proposal will match the front setback of the neighbouring property at No.5. No objection is raised to the proposed rooflights.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rGiven the scale, siting and design of the proposed development, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. A condition could be imposed to address any overlooking concerns. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r",
