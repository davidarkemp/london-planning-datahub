    "The Council considers the amendments to be non- material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment to be granted.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r32 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the site comprises a detached dwelling which would be considered a more acceptable dwelling type when assessing a proposal for a hip-to-gable roof extension, however, the proposed double hip-to-gable would not be in keeping with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, as it would appear a bulky and dominant addition to the host property and wider street scene. The extensive flat roof area proposed in the extended main roof would be highly prominent and visually intrusive within the street scene.\r\rOfficers also note that the application site benefits from permitted development rights, and as such the conversion of the roof from hipped to gable could potentially be carried out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. A Lawful Development Certificate would be required to demonstrate any permitted development \"fall-back\" position.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer extension would not be in keeping with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD as it would not be set in from the eaves or set down from the rigde by 500mm. As such, officers consider the proposed extension would be at odds with the existing roof as it would also appear a bulky and dominant addition to the host property, further given the scale and inappropriate design it would appear an incongruous addition within the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers Comments: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide revised existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
