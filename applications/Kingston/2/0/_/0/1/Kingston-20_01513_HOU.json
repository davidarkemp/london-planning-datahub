    "The proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height, and proximity to the boundaries of the site, would create an undue sense of enclosure to No. 347 Ewell Road and unacceptably limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for condition 15 (Cycle Storage) of planning permission 21/01000/FUL have been assessed and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.\r\rThe applicant has also submitted details of cycle parking layout on Drawing No. 2021-P-822-111 and this is considered to be acceptable.",
    "The application is for installation of heat pump, whereas the proposed floor plans and elevations show the rear extension in the main house. The description needs to include these extension also. Please clarify.\rIf you do not want to include the rear extension in the description of this application, please do not show these extension in the proposed drawings which have been approved in the previous application.\rPlease submit the approved and proposed drawings.\rPlease revise the proposed floor plans and elevations accordingly.\r"
