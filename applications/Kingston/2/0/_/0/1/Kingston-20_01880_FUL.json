    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r17 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. One neutral letter of representation received  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a dormer roof extension and installation 2nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises mid terrace dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r24/01777/CPU - Conversion of existing garage into a habitable space, erection of roof extension with  a rear dormer and juliet balcony. Installation of 2nos front roof lights. Refused 13.09.24\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the erection of a rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2nos front rooflights to facilitate aloft conversion. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would have a length of 4.166m, width 2.23m and depth 2.185m with a flat roof. Whilst the proposed rear dormer  would be appropriately set in from the sides and eaves  of the roofslope, it would not be appropriately set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm as set out in the recommendations of Policy Guidance 39. In addition, Officers note that  due to the siting of the house the rear elevation of the dwelling  has the prominence of a front elevation  within  the street scene  and  therefore would  be highly visible from Northweald Lane. Officers note that whilst there are other examples of rear dormers within the  vicinity residential area they  relate to either detached or semi detached properties  and where the rear elevation is not visible from the streetscene. , \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling. \r\rThe proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form and design, It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character  or appearance of the area  as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

Whilst the proposed rear dormer would not strictly comply with Policy Guidance 39 of the residential design SPD as it has not been set in at both side, officers note there are a number of  dormers visible with the streetscene.  The proposed dormer would not be readily visible and would be tiled to blend in with the existing roof reducing the visual impact. The catslide element would also be retained.

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r8 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. In response to the initial neighbour consultation , 1 letter of representation was received which is neutral in content.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  the erection of a single storey rear and side return extension and rear piggyback roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rPlanning History\r24/01291/HOU - Erection of single storey rear and side extension and rear piggy back roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Refused 04.10.24\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks approval for the erection of a single storey rear and side return extensions and rear piggyback roof extension to facilitate a roof extension. \r\rOfficers note the proposed single story piggyback gable loft extension above the main volume of the house would be set back by 4m (wall to wall measurement) and therefore would be compliant with Policy Guidance 40 in the Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe proposed development also includes a single storey rear and side return extension. The proposed side extension would be set back from the front elevation of the dwelling and set down to a new proposed ground floor level projecting a depth of 118m and width of 1.13m. It would present a single aspect glazed roof for its entire length with an eaves height of 2.18m and maximum pitch height of 3m from the new proposed lower ground floor level. The flank side wall would be constructed in brick and its rear elevation together with the partial side return would be glazed.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would project a depth of 4m from the original rear elevation projecting beyond the proposed extension and would have a width of 6.15m. It would have a dual aspect pitch roof with an eaves height of 3m which is compliant with the Residential Design SPD and a maximum pitch height of 5.12m from the proposed lower ground floor level. Whilst this proposed pitch height would be contrary to policy guidance, Officers note other examples of dual pitch roof design of rear extensions within the immediate vicinity. In this context and with the creation of a lower floor level, the proposed design is considered to be acceptable. The proposed side return of the proposed western elevation together with the proposed rear and eastern elevations would be timber clad. Officers note the proposed rear elevation would present sliding doors set back within a recess. \r\rAt first floor level on the rear elevation the existing central window is to be removed. A perforated brick pattern feature would be introduced on the right side and a corner/wrap around window on the left side where the return glazing facing towards neighbouring no 72 would be opaque glazing limiting outlook. In addition, the rear elevation of the proposed piggyback would present a large single window. The roofslope would accommodate 3nos new rooflights on the western slope and a single rooflight on the eastern slope.\r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear and side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would acceptable from a character and design perspective\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at nos 72 and 76 Deacon Road.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rOfficers have reviewed both the submitted Daylight and Sunlight Assessment (September 2024) and a Sun Study .\r\rIn reviewing the Daylight and Sunlight Assessment, whilst Officers recognise that the proposed rear extension would result in some impact on daylight on habitable rooms including the conservatory  at neighbouring no76, overall it is considered that the level of impact would be acceptable. Within this context, it is considered that  there would be no significant loss of daylight to the neighbour. \r\rIn reviewing the Existing and Proposed Daylight Shadow Study (Winter and Summer Solstice), Offices conclude that none of the south facing residential windows would see an adverse impact. In addition, overshadowing was assessed in terms of the gardens of both nos 72 and 76 Deacon Road concluding there would be no noticeable impact in terms of sunlight access. Officers accept these conclusions. \r\rThe first floor window at the rear would be sited on a corner with glazing on the side facing towards neighbouring properties. Subject to any side facing glazing being secured as non openable and obscurely glazed, it is considered that this would not give rise to any loss of privacy or perceived overlooking. \r\rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rConsultations\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and 1 objection has been recieved relating to Excessive height or bulk of buildings. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Sustainable Transportation\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Conversion of garage into habitable space. Erection of single storey rear and first floor side extension. Changes to fenestrations.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed first-floor extension would be visible within the streetscene, however, the proposal would not significantly detract from the host dwelling or surrounding area, as multiple dwellings on Bolton Road benefit from a similar extension. Policy Guidance 36, states that first floor side extensions should be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps. In this case, the applicant has not maintained 1m from the boundary however, the extension would be set down sufficiently. The pitched roof slope would aid in preserving the character and appearance of the streetscene and would not cause harm to the wider area or dwelling.  \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would have a depth of 4.4m and a total pitched roof height of 3.6m. Officers note that the depth would fall outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD however, the proposed height would make the proposal appear subordinate to the host dwelling. Additionally this aspect of the proposal would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rThe applicant proposes similar external materials and proposes to use similar window designs in the construction of this extension.\r\rConsidering the above, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the retrospective development, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the demolition of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the applicant proposes the construction of a new garage and the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. \r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises an end-terrace building comprising a retail store.\r\r28 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposed rear extension would replace the existing brick structure at the back. It would have a depth of 5.5m and a modest flat roof height of 3m, it would appear subordinate and proportionate to the building. It would be similar to the rear extension approved at 141 Hook Road under 22/03838/FUL.  As such, overall, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The nearest ground floor window that would be affected by the proposed rear extension is neighbouring property No.141 Hook Road and Sydney Court. No.141 Hook Road at ground floor level consists of a retail store and the space is not for residential use purposes. There is sufficient separation distance between the proposal and Sydney Court. Further, the overall depth of the rear structure and side wall would be reduced by the proposal compared to the existing situation. Therefore the sunlight, daylight and outlook impact to side fenestrations at Sydney Court would be reduced. Given its modest scale and appropriate design and position, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy. It is considered to comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)\r\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to change the approved planning permission ref:24/02144/HOU; this involves  bringing forward the proposed side garage of the property  bringing it forward to align with that of the existing dwelling. \r\rOfficers have reviewed the proposed amendments in the context of the approved planning permission ref : 22/02144/HOU. The approved single storey side extension  is compliant with the recommendations as set out in Policy Guidance 35  in the Residential Design SPD  in terms of being set back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm.   The proposed  amendments are considered greater than non material  and  would conflict  with the recommendations set out in Policy Guidance 35 and the recommendations as set out in the Officer Report for 22/02144/HOU.\r"
