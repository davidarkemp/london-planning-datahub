    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration\r\rConsultation\rSix Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to be considered in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 40 and No. 44 Cleveland Road. Both properties benefit from rear extensions. Due to the limited depth of approximately 2.4m, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Officers note the proposed windows on the ground floor side elevation but consider the existing boundary treatment sufficient to protect privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is the ground floor unit of the three-storey mid-terrace building No. 8 Victoria Road, Surbiton. The application site is part of the Grade II listed 2-8 Victoria Road, which is a mid/late 19th century rendered terrace of 7 shops with two floors of accommodation above, including a pediment above each central window at first floor and a decorated parapet. \r\rThe character of the terrace is one of architectural unity with distinctive fenestration (6 panel windows of which the lower 4 are casements at first floor, 9 panel second floor sliding-sash windows and interesting and coherent detailing including pronounced window reveals, cills and cill-supports, timber shadow panels and a continuous bracketed and corberlled parapet. The ground floor shops display a variety of design approaches but have a consistency in general dimensions of frontage, fascia and projecting sign.\r\rThe application site is within the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area, as well as the Surbiton District Centre Inset Area. Furthermore other listed buildings are located nearby, including no. 12 Victoria Road (Grade II) immediately to the West of the building, and Surbiton Station (Grade II) approximately 60m from the site.\r\rPlanning History \r\r22/00442/ADV - Display of 1 no externally illuminated fascia sign and 1no projection hanging sign. Application Granted with Conditions. \r\r22/00439/LBC - Internal and external (including shopfront) alterations and associated works. Application Granted with Conditions. \r\r22/01139/FUL - Installation of 2no. new external plant units and acoustic screens at 2nd floor level, HVAC pipework and air intake luvre grilles at 1st floor level and associated works. Pending consideration. \r\rConsultations\r\r41 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received. \r\rHistoric England - No comments. \r\rEnvironmental Health Officer - No objection subject to planning condition.\r\rHeritage and Conservation - Concern regarding the installation of acoustic screens around the external plant at second floor level. From an aesthetic point of view (whilst acknowledging that they are unlikely to be seen from street level), as well as functional and long-term sustainable point of view.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the installation of two new external plant units at second floor level, installation of HVAC pipework through the flat roof at first floor level, as well as the installation of extract and air intake louvre grilles in rear wall to lightwell at first floor level. \r\rThese works would be largely unviewable from the streetscene, sited to the rear of the building, and are appropriate additions to a structure in commercial use. Officers therefore consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the building and surrounding area.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The HVAC pipework riser would be attached to the exterior of the building, exiting through the flat roof of the first floor level and rising to the HVAC plant on the roof of the second floor. This pipework would be in direct view of a first floor window of the adjoining property at No. 9 Victoria Road. This would result in some visual intrusion to the window of this property. \r\rHowever, in conjunction with the proposed scale and design of the pipework, as the pipework would be situated approximately 1.8 metres away from this window Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a significantly detrimental impact on the neighbouring property at No. 9 Victoria Road through visual intrusion or loss of outlook. \r\rThrough the installation of plant machinery and associated elements, the impact the proposal would have on neighbouring properties through the creation of noise is a key factor to consider. \r\rThe application has been supported by an Acoustic Assessment which indicates that the calculated rating level for the new plant is approximately 6dB below the measured background sound level, which meets the requirements of Kingston Council to be 5dB lower than measured background noise. Furthermore, this application has been reviewed by the Environmental Health Officer, who did not object to the proposal. As such Officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties.  \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rOfficers Comments: As it is considered that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the structure, would not result in a significant loss of historic fabric, and that the development would not be viewable from the streetscene, Officers consider that the proposal would not cause harm to the cultural significance of the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area or the Grade II listed building 2-8 Victoria Road.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

These details were previously approved through 16/16625/COND.\r\rThe Council's Pollution Control Officer raises no objections and so this condition can be discharged. \r\rCondition 18\r\rCondition 18 reads as follows:\r\rThe levels of buildings, roads, parking spaces and pathways within the site shall only be in accordance with details which have been previously submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before development is commenced.\r\rDrawings 15571 C 00-3 Rev. A and 15571 C 00-4 Rev. A have been submitted which indicate the site levels in relation to surrounding land. Elevations of the building have been provided which clarify building levels in relation to the ground level. These details are considered sufficient to discharge this condition. \r\rCondition 20\r\rCondition 20 reads:\r\rThe development shall be completed in accordance with the following details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, before building work commences.\r\r(a)\tSamples of materials for all external finishes (including their colour and texture).\r(b)\tDetailed cross sections through façade, and sample elevation to demonstrate brick work detailing (1:10).\r(c)\tBoundary treatment (including walls, fences and gates).\r(d)\tTreatment and layout of all parts of the site not covered by the approved buildings, including hard and soft landscaping.\r(e)\tRefuse storage facilities.\r(f)\tExternal and lighting.\r(g)\tSewer and drainage runs.\r(h)\tAny external plant and equipment.\r\rPart a - Whilst no samples have been received, the building has been constructed and photos of the completed building (including brick and windows) and detailed drawings have been provided which demonstrate that the materials are of a reasonable quality and sympathetic to the surrounding area. The intent of the condition is therefore satisfied.\r\rPart b - Detailed cross section drawings have been provided through the building. These details are considered acceptable.

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r8x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters. \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would project 4 metres to the rear, which exceeds policy guidelines. However, there is an existing extension to the rear of the closest neighbouring property at no. 13 Connaught Road. It is considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe side extension would be modest in height and would be in general accordance with the SPD. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the conversion of a garage into habitable space. However, the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate one spaces for on-site parking. The PTAL for this part of Connaught Road, is 4. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 0.5 - 0.75 spaces per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 4, 1 to 3 and 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

These extensions are sympathetically designed and respectful of the character and design of the Host Property and do not impact negatively on the wider setting or area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension, would not be set down from the ridge line of the original roof slope, would not be set in to the sides, or set up from the eaves, contrary to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD. However, the proposed rear dormer would be similar to a dormer that could be erected within the permitted development rights for the Host Property and for this reason, given the credible fall-back position, Officers consider that the proposed dormer is considered acceptable. Officers also note that following the previous refusal the dormer has been reduced in size making it more acceptable.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers Note: The proposed development would extend slightly further than the furthest projecting rear wall of no.3 Grosvenor Gardens and only slightly further than the rear wall of no.7 Grosvenor Gardens. For these reasons, no significant increase in the loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to either of the adjoining properties in Grosvenor Gardens.

Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk assessment states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

Two representations were received objecting to the proposal on grounds including:\r\rLoss of privacy as a result of the Juliet balcony\rUse of render instead of brick\rNoise and general disturbance during construction\r\rOffiers note: The proposed Juliet balcony has been removed and a condition would be imposed requiring the development to be rendered. \r\rOther matters raised which are not material planning considerations to be dealt with by building regulations and party wall legislation include:\r\rProject management of the job\rOption to have boundary wall of neighbouring property rendered\rNo boundary wall shown along the shared boundary with No.43\r\rRevised drawings have been submitted subsequent to the initial submission and objections that include:\r\r- The patio has been reduced in height to no more than 30cm above ground level\r- The rear dormer has been reduced in scale, altering the layout to the loft and introduction of  a skylight to the rear instead of the Juliet balcony (raised as a concern in the objection)\r- The roof has been altered from a gable to a partial hipped roof to match No. 39 \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed front porch would have a modest projection from the front elevation, with a roof of an appropriate pitch and design. The porch would be finished in brick and utilise the existing porch windows and doors, with no impact to parking on site.\r\rThe proposed ground floor extension would accord with the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, and would be of an acceptable scale and design finish to match the host building. The extension would match the depth of the rear extension to the neighbouring property at No.39 Hemsby Road, and would be consistent with the overall pattern of single storey development within the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed first floor side extension would be setback from the front elevation, and the boundary in accordance with the SPD, with a roof form that reflects and relates well to the main house, and would appear a subordinate and proportionate addition to the property.  The rendered finish would be in keeping with both the application property and surrounding development. Fenestration details would also match the existing windows to the front elevation.\r\rHip-to-gable roof extensions are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. \r\rIn this instance, the proposed hip to gable roof would not alter this pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses, given the different roof form that exists to the neighbouring property at No.43 Hemsby Road and the proposed partial hip design would match that of No.349 Hemsby. Officers also note that there are a variety of roof forms and property types evident along Hemsby Road and there are examples, including some nearby to the application site. It is therefore considered on balance that the proposed hip to gable roof extension would not appear unduly different within, or be harmful to, the character and appearance of the application property, adjoining property or wider streetscene. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would be set down from the main roof, it would be appropriately set in from the sides of the roof slope and in from the eaves, and as such would appear as a proportionate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties to consider are Nos.39 and 43 Hemsby Road. \r\rThere are existing extensions at ground and first floor levels to both neighbouring properties and the proposed development would mostly align with these. To No.39 the properties are not attached. At ground floor the extension would be of an acceptable scale and depth and separated from the neighbouring property ensuring no loss of privacy, outlook daylight or sunlight. There are no habitable windows to the flank elevation of No.39 that would be affected by the first floor extension and those windows proposed to the flank elevation of the first floor extension will be obscured (secured by condition). \r\rThere is an existing ground floor extension at No.43 Hemsby Road, and the proposed rear extension would not project beyond this. Given the siting, scale and design of the other proposed extensions, it is unlikely there would be any loss of amenities to occupants of No.43. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rThe representations received have been carefully considered, issues with regards to disturbance during construction are noted - however, it is to be acknowledged that any residential extension involves some general disturbance, if this passes into a nuisance (assuming the threshold is passed) the Environmental Health team of the Council has powers to intervene, no evidence has been submitted that would demonstrate that the proposed development would be uncharacteristically noises or cause uncharacteristic disturbance. Questions with regards to Project Management are not relevant to the planning process. \r\rOverall, it is concluded that the development would be in general accordance with the Development Plan.",
