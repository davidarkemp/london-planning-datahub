    "The proposed changes, involving the  loss of 3 Nos. boardrooms and their conversion to  hotel rooms, is materially different from the development approved by planning permission 06/12424/FUL (as varied by 12/12574/NMA) and as such the S96A application for a non-material amendment is refused.\r\r",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependant on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. The local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude."
