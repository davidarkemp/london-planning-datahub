    "The proposed erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights and 1no side gable window falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "The site comprises a detached, two-storey dwelling located on the northern side of Hunters Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified. 1 objection received:\r- Loss of light \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r21/03574/HOU - Erection of two storey-side extension and single-storey rear extension - Refused 22.02.2022. Dismissed at appeal.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rFire Strategy\r\rDesign \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers Comment: \rThe proposal is for the erection of a part two storey part single storey rear and single storey side extension.\r\rThe previous application (21/03574/HOU) was refused for the following reason:\r\rThe proposed two-storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, form, siting and design would appear as an excessive, disproportionate and incongruous addition to the dwelling, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rA single storey extension is proposed that extends along the side elevation of the building and extends 4.5m to the rear. Whilst it is not set back from the front of the building (as advised in the Council's Residential Design SPD), the side extension is the same as the previous application which was not refused on this basis. The proposed extensions is larger than the previous application which was 3.8m in depth but remains appropriate in design and scale. \r\rA two storey extension is proposed that is 3.7m in depth, 4.3m in width and 6.6m in height. The proposed extension is significantly smaller in scale than the previous application (21/03574/HOU) which extended the full width and height of the building (albeit broadly the same in depth) and it is also noted that the appeal was allowed in this respect of the above reason for refusal. \rOverall, the proposed extensions are sympathetic in design and is proportionate in scale to the existing building.\r\rFor these reasons, the proposal is not considered to result in harm to the character or appearance of the area and, as such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: \r\rWhilst the previous application was not refused on the basis of the impact on 29 Hunters Road, the ground floor extension extends further to the rear than the previous application and the first floor extension is sited closer to this boundary. This neighbouring property appears to have an extension and a shed sited along the neighbour boundary and No. 27 Hunters Road itself also has a storage building on the boundary that extends approx. 1.6m beyond the neighbouring building / extension. The proposed extension will extend a further 2.1m (approx.) beyond the existing storage building at a height of 2.5m.  Given the depth beyond the existing building/structures to this neighbouring property, and the height of 2.5m which is not considered unreasonable, the proposed ground floor side and rear extension is not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight.\r\rIn terms of the first floor extension, this extends approximately 1.4m beyond the existing ground floor extension along the boundary and 6.2m beyond the primary rear elevation to this neighbour. The proposed extension is, however, set 2m in from the neighbour boundary and approximately 3.6m from the neighbouring building at full height. On this basis, officers are satisfied that the proposed extension would not be overbearing and would not interrupt the 45 degree line to ground or first floor habitable windows.\r\rWith regard to the impact on No. 27 Hunters Road, planning application 21/03574/HOU was refused for the following reason:\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed two storey rear extension would comply with BRE Guidance and would not result in in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook from the nearest habitable room windows of No.25 and No. 29 Hunters Road. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThis reason for refusal was upheld by the appeal inspector who agreed that the two storey extension would unacceptably harm the living conditions of the occupiers of No.25 due to loss of daylight and sunlight and associated sense of enclosure. \r\rIn comparison to the previous application, the extension has been significantly reduced in height and set away from the neighbour boundary with No. 25 Hunters Road. The extension would be set away from the flank windows to this neighbour (which appear to be secondary windows) by approximately 6m and officers are satisfied that the extension would not be overbearing or interrupt the 45 degree line to this window on this basis.\r\rThere is one new first floor flank window proposed which is shown as obscure glazed. Otherwise, the additional overlooking from the first floor extension is not considered to be beyond the established level of overlooking in this area.\r\rFor these reasons, the development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and the proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
