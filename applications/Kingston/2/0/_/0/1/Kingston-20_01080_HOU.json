    "By virtue of its increased footprint, excessive width and close proximity to site boundaries, the proposed single storey rear extension would fail to appear as a proportionate or subordinate addition. The proposal would therefore harm the character of the host dwelling, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure to a principal habitable room window at neighbouring No. 4 Princes Road by virtue of its excessive depth along the boundary, contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\r",
    "Condition 14  (Refuse) of planning permission 21/01585/FUL - Officers have reviewed the information provided and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "Condition 15  (Cycle Parking) of planning permission 21/01585/FUL - Officers have reviewed the information provided and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "Please provide the addresses (owner/occupier) of all adjoining properties to the rear.",
    "The submitted roof plans do not have a North point.\r\rNote: Please provide existing and proposed roof plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged."
