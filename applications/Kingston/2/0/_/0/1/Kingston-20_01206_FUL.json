    "Consultations\r10no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. One representation received - neutral in content. Points raised duly noted by planning officer, however, the points raised do not materially affect the assessment of this application. \r\rEnvironmental Health Officer: No objection, subject to condition relating to noise rating level of the proposed air conditioning unit - as applied.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear conservatory.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, end terrace property. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprise of a mix of terraced, semi-detached and detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe proposals involve the erection of a rear conservatory type structure measuring 3.3m in depth, and 4.4m in width. The extension is proposed to have a pitched roof to a maximum height of 3.2m (2.4m to eaves). The proposed extension is considered minor in its scale and appropriate in its design, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed rear single-storey extension would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",

No responses were received.   \r\rKingston Town Centre Conservation Area Advisory Committee: No objection.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No objections\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issue to assess in the consideration of this application is the impact that the development would have on the character of the area and the streetscene and impact upon heritage assets and impact upon highway safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rParagraph 136 of the NPPF states that the quality and character of places can suffer when advertisements are poorly sited and designed. A separate consent process within the planning system controls the display of advertisements, which should be operated in a way which is simple, efficient and effective. Advertisements should be subject to control only in the interests of amenity and public safety, taking account of cumulative impacts. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe Council's Supplementary Planning Document titled, \"Shopfronts and Shopsigns\" (2005) provides guidance on new shopfronts and signage (including projecting and illuminated). \r\rThe proposals include the installation of illuminated replacement fascia signage to the front elevation, an illuminated projecting sign and a projecting awning. \r\rThe proposed fascia sign would comprise of white lettering fixed to a black aluminium fascia board with brass edging. The fascia and signage is appropriately scaled in comparison to the existing building and other fascias and signage along the riverside frontage. \r\rThe projecting sign comprises of brass letting on a Perspex sign with neon bordering. It projects approx. 1m beyond the fascia and is broadly the same in size as the existing projecting sign.\r\rThe proposed awning projects approximately 2.6m from the shopfront with a clear head height of 2.2m. Similarly scaled awnings are common along this part of the riverside frontage. \r\rThe levels of illumination to the signage would not create any significant light pollution.\r\rOverall, the design and materials are considered to be visually unobtrusive and are considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene, thereby complying with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rGiven the existing context of shopfronts along this part of the riverside, the proposals are considered to be sympathetic to the scale, mass, height and aesthetic attributes of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and would not result in any harm to the heritage asset. \r\rHighway Safety\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree. \r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rLocal Planning Authorities are expected to have regard to its effect upon the safe use and operation of any form of traffic or transport on land (including the safety of pedestrians), on or over water, or in the air. Public safety considerations, the second arm of control over advertisements, do not arise very frequently. However, when it can be shown that signs would be confused with traffic signals or the visibility of drivers is impaired, a solid and sustainable ground for refusal of Advertisement Regulation consent is provided. \r\rThe signage would be illuminated but would not be visible from the highway. The signage and canopy would not conflict with or impede the free-flow of pedestrian or vehicular movement or create a distraction to highway users. It would therefore not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety. The proposed signage is therefore in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposed signage and awning are considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The proposal therefore complies with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\rThe proposals would not have any material effect on highway safety. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which otherwise indicate that advertisement consent should be refused. Therefore, it is recommended that advertisement consent be granted. \r\rRecommendation \r\rThat advertisement consent should be GRANTED.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans.

    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The application site is located on the north side of Hook Rise North on the corner of the west side of Fullers Way North. The A3 is adjacent to the south of the site. The site is vacant with its former use being for storage of cars.\r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in use and the site is not located in a conservation area and does not form part of the curtilage of a listed building.\r\rA new 3 - 4 storey building comprising 9 flats was approved on the site through 19/02048/FUL. \r\rPlanning History\r\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rAssessment\r\rSection 96A gives Councils the power to make non-material changes to planning permission. The legislation states:\r\r(1) A local planning authority may make a change to any planning permission (granted following an application to the authority), relating to land in their area if they are satisfied that the change is not material.\r(2) In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission.\r(3) The power conferred by subsection (1) includes power to make a change to a planning permission,\r(a) to impose new conditions\r(b) to remove or alter existing conditions\r(4) The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only on an application made by or on behalf of a person with an interest in the land to which the planning permission relates.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non-material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it.\r\rAlthough what defines a non-material amendment is to the discretion of the local authority concerned and lacking in legal definition, the following key tests could be applied in assessing the acceptability of a change to an approved scheme under the non-material amendment procedure: \r\r -Is the proposed change material/significant in terms of its scale (magnitude, degree etc) in relation to the original approval? \r- Would the proposed change result in a development that will appear noticeably different to what Official interested parties may have envisaged? \r- Are the changes of consequence? \r- Could the change result in an impact on the amenity of occupiers of adjoining properties? \r- Would the interests of any third party or body who participated in or where informed of the original decision be disadvantaged in any way? \r- Would the amendments be contrary to any planning policy of the Council?\r\rOfficers Comment: \r\rThe proposal is for a minor reduction to the depth of the approved building at the first floor level. The ground floor (parking) and second and third floors (which are set back) are unaffected. \r\rThis is not considered to give rise to a significantly different appearance in the context of the overall scheme. \r\rThe proposed change will move the building further away from the neighbouring X at the first floor level and so is not considered to impact on the amenity of occupiers of adjoining properties or result in the interests of any third party or body who participated in or were informed of the original decision being disadvantaged in any way.\r\rThe proposal will result in a small reduction in the GIA of the associated first floor 1 bedroom unit and private balcony. However, this is only a minor reduction and the relevant standards set out in the Nationally Described Space Standards, London Plan and RBK Residential Design SPD are still satisfied.\r\rAs such, the Council considers the amendment to the proposal to be non- material changes and, as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment is granted. \r",
    "Consultations\r6no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received within the timeframe given. Officers note that one objection has been submitted but is not valid given it was received outside of the representation deadline. \r\rOfficer comment: Notwithstanding the above, the objection raises concerns relating to the scale of the proposed extension, loss of light and inaccuracies of the plans.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, mid terraced property. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprise of a mix of terraced, semi-detached and detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe proposals involve the erection of a rear extension partially measuring 4m and partially measuring 2m in depth, spanning the full width of the dwelling. The extension is proposed to have a flat roof with one flush rooflight. The proposed extension is considered minor in its scale and appropriate in its design, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. \r\rThe proposed extension would broadly meet the criteria set out in the Residential Design Guide SPD for rear extensions in terms of its depth and would fully comply with the criteria with respect to the proposed height of the extension.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\r(It is noted that the plan is inaccurate in that the annotations incorrectly plot the neighbouring properties either side of the application dwelling. Officers note the true positions of No.s 85 and 89 in relation to the application dwellinghouse.)\r\rThe proposed rear single-storey extension would project 2m from the rear building line of No. 85 and 1.1m from the rear building line of No. 89. The proposals are not considered to cause any significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultants and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 62 (Drinking Water Infrastructure) of planning permission 21/04022/FUL, which states:\r\rCondition 62 (Drinking Water Infrastructure) - Prior to above ground works, plans and details shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority demonstrating the provision and future management of free drinking water within the public realm. The plans and details shall show the location and design of the proposed drinking water infrastructure, along with measures to ensure its future maintenance and management. The development shall be carried out in accordance with these plans and details, and drinking water made available to the public for free in accordance with the plans and details prior to occupation of the development, and in perpetuity.\r\rReason: To comply with Policy D8 (Public realm) of the London Plan 2021.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises an end terrace dwelling within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with 2no. rooflights to front roofslope.\r\rConsultation\r5x neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Hip to gable roof extensions are not strictly in accordance with guidance given ln the Residential Design SPD. However, overall the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design, particularly as a similar hip to gable loft conversion with rear dormer was considered permitted development with the granting of Certificate 14/12977/LDP at no.26.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy for 42 Wolsey Drive. However, Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r",
