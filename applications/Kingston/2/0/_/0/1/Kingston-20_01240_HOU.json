    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any new windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the eastern or western flank elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Informative:\rAn application to the Council's Highway Team would be required so that a site survey can be undertaken to determine if the Crossover Policy would permit the installation of a crossover. The hardsurfaced area within the site would need to be at least 4.8m depth for the provision of a vehicular crossover. On the basis that it is permeable or drains to an area within the site, planning permission would not be required for the provision of a hard surface within the front garden. The applicant can contact the Highway Authority on 020 8547 5002.\r",
    "Block Plan - Please can you amend the Block Plan to showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing building and site boundaries. Please re-submit only the Block Plan.",
