    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Impact to the Green Belt\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rGreen Belt \rSection 13 (Protecting Green Belt Land) of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021) states that the Government attaches great importance to Green Belts. The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence. Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances.\r\rParagraph 138 of the NPPF (2021) sets out that the Green Belt serves five purposes: \ra) to check the unrestricted sprawl of large built-up areas; \rb) to prevent neighbouring towns merging into one another; \rc) to assist in safeguarding the countryside from encroachment; \rd) to preserve the setting and special character of historic towns; and \re) to assist in urban regeneration, by encouraging the recycling of derelict and other urban land.\r\rParagraph 149 sets out that the construction of new buildings in the Green Belt is inappropriate, listing exceptions to this. Exception 'c' of paragraph 149 of the NPPF (2021) is as follows: 'c) the extension or alteration of a building provided that it does not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building'\r\rRecent Court of Appeal and Supreme Court Judgements are material planning considerations. In relation to the openness of the Green Belt the Court of Appeal Judgement in Turner v SSCLG & East Dorset Council [2016] EWCA Civ 466 and Samuel Smith Old Brewery (Tadcaster) & Oxton Farm v North Yorkshire CC & Darrington Quarries Ltd [2018] EWCA Civ 489, confirmed that the Green Belt has a spatial aspect as well as a visual aspect and assessing openness of the Green Belt was found not to be limited to measuring the volume of the existing and proposed structures on site. The Supreme Court clarified in their judgement dated 05.03.2020 ([2020] UKSC 3) that the matters relevant to openness in any particular case are a matter of planning judgement.\r\rPrevious refusals and approvals of planning permission and the subsequent dismissal of planning appeals are also material planning considerations which must be given weight in the determination of any future application. \r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant seeks to erect a two storey side extension, front porch extension, single storey rear extension and hip-to-gable roof extension with rear dormer roof extension. It is noted that the dwelling has not been extended, aside from the garage, and shows its original layout. The existing/original footprint of the dwelling is approximately 87 square metres, the proposed extension would add approximately further 103.96 square metres resulting in approximately 83% increase in floor space. \r\rGiven the scale of the proposed two storey side extension, the proposal would be a disproportionate addition over and above the size of the original building and therefore it would be an inappropriate development in the Green Belt which is not falling under one of the exceptions listed in paragraph 149 of the NPPF (2021). Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should only be approved in Very Special Circumstances (VSCs)\r\rGiven that the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposal would fall under a VSC, officers consider that the proposal represents inappropriate development in the Green Belt which is, by definition, harmful. The disproportionate addition would also harm the openness of the Green Belt. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy DM5 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy G2 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey front and rear extension would have a depth that is in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however the proposals would have an appropriate height and roof form and as such would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would not be set in from the shared boundary at first floor level, would not be appropriately set down from the ridge of the original roof slope, and would propose an unusual partial gable end on the original roof slope and proposed first floor extension. As such, given the inadequate set in from the boundary, the proposal would not uphold the characteristic gaps between the dwellings viewed within the immediate area, and would result in a 'terracing effect' which would detract from the established character of the surrounding area. Further, given the unusual roof form, and inappropriate set down from the original roofslope, officers consider that the proposal would detract from the appearance of the original dwelling and would not be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development within the area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposals would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that the neighbouring properties benefit from existing extensions at ground floor level, officers consider that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would increase the size of the existing garage, the proposal would not be wide enough to safely accommodate on-site parking, in accordance with the guidance set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD. However, officers note that the hardstanding to the front of the site would be able to accommodate on-site parking. Therefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rVery Special Circumstance - paragraph\r\rIn conclusion, given the design and siting of the proposed two storey side extension, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
