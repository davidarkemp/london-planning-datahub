    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the west flank elevation of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r11x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2x representations have been received, which highlight the following concerns:-\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- The Kingston Design Guide suggests \"Extensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth\" \r- The proposed extension would create an \"overpowering\" building in terms of height and bulk when viewed from the garden of no. 26 Aldridge Rise\r\rOf the 2x representations received, one representation made comments neither objecting to or supporting the Planning Application and highlighting the importance of Swifts.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety Assessment\r\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development, by reason of the scale and siting of the proposed side extension, would appear as an acceptable addition within the Aldridge Rise street scene, as a result of being set away from the street and when viewed in conjunction with other existing roof additions in Aldridge Rise, particularly opposite at no.21 Aldridge Rise. The proposal is therefore in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rOfficer Comment: There is an existing part two storey to the rear/side of no.22 Aldridge Rise. The proposed first floor extension would cause a slight loss of daylight and direct sunlight to existing ground floor rooflight windows above a kitchen and utility room and side facing windows at no.22 Aldridge Rise. However, this loss, is not considered that there would be a significant loss of light such as to refuse planning permission. Conditions are recommended regarding proposed side facing windows at first floor and above.\r\rThe proposed first floor extension would project 6 metres to the rear of the neighbouring property at no.26 Aldridge Rise. However, the proposed first floor crown roofed extension is set away from the common shared boundary with no.26 and is to the north of this neighbouring property. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of daylight, or loss of direct sunlight.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Outbuilding Proposed Elevations - please provide elevations of the proposed outbuilding. The submitted plans do not indicate the height of the outbuilding rear window.\r\rElevations must be drawn at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged."
