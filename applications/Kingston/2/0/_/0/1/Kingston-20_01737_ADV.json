    "Consultations\r21no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of the existing detached garage and WC and erection of single-storey rear extension and conversion of existing attached garage to habitable space and open yard.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, semi-detached property. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprise of predominantly semi-detached and detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe proposals involve the demolition of the existing detached rear garage building and WC and conservatory and replacement erection of a single storey rear extension.  The application also seeks permission for the conversion of the existing attached garage to habitable accommodation. To the side a passageway would be proposed to allow independent through access to the rear garden.\r\rThe rear extension is proposed to have a flat roof with two similar sized projecting roof lanterns. The extension would be part 4.5m and part 7.7m in depth and would span the full width of the dwellinghouse. The proposed extension is considered appropriate in its scale and appropriate in its design, in keeping with the host building. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed rear single-storey extension would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties. Officers note that the maximum projection is at an inset of approximately 3.8m from the adjoining neighbour (No. 4).\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",
