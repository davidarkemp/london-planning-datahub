    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance, and in particular its height, would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter.  Furthermore, it would not be in keeping with but detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would reduce the width of the footpath to 1500mm. The width of the footway should be 2000mm to facilitate two people in wheelchairs to pass each other comfortably. Where this width is not possible, a clear width of 1500mm should be provided. As such the proposal has the potential to push users of the footpath onto the road and endanger highway users and prejudice highway safety.  The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on 3 Poplar Gardens. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey side extension, which would have a flat roof area to the front, and would measure 3.2 metres in height. The side extension would also incorporate a pitched roof which would measure approximately 4.3 metres in height. The proposed side extension would not meet all of the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, as the proposed flat/pitched roof of the extension would arguably not relate well to the original dwelling which incorporates a cat slide and hipped roof. Similarly the ridge of the pitched roof element would encroach on the cill height of windows on the first floor. However, the application proposes to raise the existing impacted window on the side elevation to above the height of the extension. Additionally the proposed development would not be set in from the boundary by 250mm to ensure guttering does not overhang the neighbouring property at No. 2 Poplar Gardens. Instead guttering has been included as part of the proposed side extension, within the site boundary. Whilst the proposed extension would not meet all requirements of the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider the proposed extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. Whilst the proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the recommended 3 metre maximum height for flat roofed rear extensions as outlined by the Residential Design SPD this element would also be considered to appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the conversion of a garage into a habitable room. As the existing garage would not meet the minimum required garage dimensions for one vehicle, its conversion would not result in the loss of parking. Furthermore it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least two off-street car parking spaces. This level of provision would be in excess of the standards set out in the London Plan, however as this is similar to the existing situation, this would not warrant refusal. \r\rThe application proposes to partly convert the existing garage into space for bikes. Officers consider the application has demonstrated compliance with the cycle parking standards set out in the London Plan. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "CONSULTATIONS: \rNeighbour notifications: No representations have been received. \r\rHistoric England: Authorise delegated determination. No views expressed on the proposal.\rKingston Town CAAC: No objection.\r\rSite and Surroundings \rThe application building comprises of a 3-storey building. The application pertains to the ground floor commercial unit. \r\rThe site is located within the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The building that the advertisement is to be displayed on is a statutorily Grade II Listed Building. \r\rProposal \rThis advertisement consent application seeks consent for the display of 2 x non-illuminated fascia signs; one to the front elevation and one to the side elevation of the building. \r\rIt is noted that a separate application for listed building consent has been submitted to the Local Planning Authority (application reference: 22/00302/LBC). \r\rPlanning Considerations \rThe key planning considerations in this case are: \r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area (including heritage impact); and\r- The impact of the development on highway safety \r\rCharacter and Appearance / Impact upon Heritage Assets\rThe NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities. \r\rPlanning decisions should ensure that developments: will function well and add to the overall quality of the area; are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; are sympathetic to local character and history; and establish a strong sense of place. \r\rPermission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, taking into account and local design standards or style guides in plans or supplementary planning documents. Conversely, where the design of a development accords with clear expectations in plan policies, design should not be used by the decision-maker as a valid reason to object to development. \r\rAt the regional level, the London Plan requires that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. It should improve an area's visual or physical connection with natural features. In areas of poor or ill-defined character, development should build on the positive elements that can contribute to establishing an enhanced character for the future function of the area. \r#\rArchitecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape. It should incorporate the highest quality materials and design, appropriate to its context. \r\rAccordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development: \r- Recognises distinctive local features and character \r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment \r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality \r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\" \r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings \r\rThe most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following: \r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy \r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing \r- Landscape setting and features \r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings \r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary \r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc. \r\rThe Council's Residential Design SPD provides further in-depth guidance. Policy Guidance 29 (Materials and Detailing) states that: \r- Developers will be expected to demonstrate that they have considered the choice of materials and design detailing of those buildings that they consider represent the prevailing character of the streetscene or local area. \r- A preference should be given to the use of prevailing materials and details used in the surrounding local area unless it can be demonstrated that the choice of materials or use of design features in a proposal for residential development would enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene. \r- Care should be taken to ensure the replication of detailing or materials present in the street scene of local area represents an authentic synthesis of local architectural styles that compliment those of the host building or surrounding area. \r\rDevelopment proposals which include the use of materials or detailing which is out of context or is lacking in imagination or character will be discouraged. \r\rNPPF provisions: It is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 at para 195 sets out that the local planning authority should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset... They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset's conservation and any aspect of the proposal. \r\rParas 194-198 sets out the framework for decision making in planning applications relating to heritage assets and this application takes into account the relevant considerations in these paragraphs. \r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy 1.1 of the Council's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy, (Core Strategy), and policy 7C of the Council's Adopted Development Management Development Plan Document, (DPD), seek to ensure that new development conserves the significance of heritage assets. Development should be sympathetic in its materials and architectural detailing and the introduction of designs or materials which undermine the significance of heritage assets should be avoided. More broadly, policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021 collectively seek to ensure that new development is informed by and complements its surroundings. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rHistoric England's listing record sets out: \"Late C16 timber-framed building with perhaps C18 lath and plaster facade. Jettied at 1st floor level on long side elevation and at 1st and 2nd floor levels behind facade to Thames Street. Weather-boarded on long and rear elevations. Includes two original window openings with diagonally set mullions in one example. Internally, some C18 joinery features. To the rear, a late C18 building of two storeys and mansard. Brick below weather-boarded and stuccoed above. Two bays to Kings Passage.\"\r\rThe Council's Supplementary Planning Document titled, \"Shopfronts and Shopsigns\" (2005) provides guidance on signage for historic buildings. The SPD for shopfronts and shopsigns states \"any illuminated fascia sign on historic buildings should preserve the character and appearance of the building and area. Effective and acceptable forms of illuminations are those where the light fitting is concealed and include: tubes encased in trough housings, uplighters or downlighters which should be carefully located so that the spread of light is controlled and not overbright; or internally-illuminated individual letters or characters in the form of tubes encased with a translucent face and solid/opaque sides or vice versa, or solid characters raised with tubes beneath to create a 'halo' effect.\" \r\rThe application proposes the installation of fascia sign to the front and side wraparound elevations. The signage would be non-illuminated and comprise of satin black painted back panel with printed powder-coated aluminium lettering and logos affixed to the back panel with concealed fixings. \r\rThe new advertisements are considered appropriate in their style, form and design given the heritage setting and designation of the application site. The signage is considered to be of a good-quality which is not considered to harmfully impact upon the character of the area within the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area, nor result in harm to visual amenity or the appearance and special interest of this Grade-II listed building. \r\rHighway Safety\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree. \r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rLocal Planning Authorities are expected to have regard to its effect upon the safe use and operation of any form of traffic or transport on land (including the safety of pedestrians), on or over water, or in the air. Public safety considerations, the second arm of control over advertisements, do not arise very frequently. However, when it can be shown that signs would be confused with traffic signals or the visibility of drivers is impaired, a solid and sustainable ground for refusal of Advertisement Regulation consent is provided. \r\rThe proposed advertisement would not be illuminated and would not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety. The proposed signage is therefore in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposed development would provide for the display of advertisements to the ground floor commercial unit at 1 Thames Street, Kingston. It is considered that the proposed signage be acceptable resulting in no harm to the character and appearance of the designated Grade-II listed building, nor on the wider Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. \r\rThe proposals would not have any material effect on highway safety. \r\rTherefore, it is considered that the proposed development would be in accordance with paragraph 200 of the NPPF 2021, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which otherwise indicate that advertisement consent should be refused. Therefore, it is recommended that advertisement consent be granted. \r\rRecommendation \rThat advertisement consent should be GRANTED.\r",
