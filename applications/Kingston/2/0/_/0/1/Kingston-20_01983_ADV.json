    "The site comprises a semi detached dwelling located to the east of Dysart Avenue, Kingston Upon Thames.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations. \r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 letter of support was received. \r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Design and character \r- Neighbour amenity  \r\rDesign and Character\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal is for a single storey rear extension measuring 5m in depth and extending the full width of the existing dwelling. The extension has a pitched roof (with PV panels atop) ranging in height between 2.95m and 3.9m.\r\rThe proposed extension is appropriate in design and materials and proportionate in scale to the main dwelling. For these reasons, the proposal is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the area and is therefore in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed extension extends approximately 2m beyond the neighbouring No. 15 Dysart Avenue (which has an existing rear extension). The plans indicate that the proposed extension would not interrupt the 45 degree line (on plan). On this basis, and given the height is not unreasonable, the proposal is not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour. The proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour. \r\rWith regard to No. 11 Dysart Avenue, there is a significant separation of approximately 4m to this neighbour. On this basis, and as the height and depth is not unreasonable and as the proposal would not interrupt the 45 degree line to the nearest habitable windows, the proposal is not considered overbearing or likely to result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour. The proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour.\r\rFor these reasons, the proposed extension is not considered to result in an undue loss of amenity for surrounding neighbours, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a brief Fire Safety Strategy which covers the crtieria set out in Policy D12(A) for a development of this scale and nature and can be secured by way of condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a tennis club.\r\rProposal\rInstallation of 10 nos led lighting to two central tennis courts\r\rConsultation\r26 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - No Objections\r\rRBK Biodiversity Officer - Raised concerns regarding Bat foraging times between October and November. However, it is noted that the adjoining site, Surbiton Racket Club has permission to allow lighting at these times also.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on bats\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed lighting would be installed away from the road and would not be readily visible within the streetscene. For this reason, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed courts would be sited a significant distance away from the nearest neighbouring residential property and the noise associated with them would not amount to anything over and above that generated by the existing use of the site. The application is supported by a lighting report which demonstrates that there would be minimal light spill from the proposed floodlights beyond the site boundaries. Officers recommend that the illuminance levels of the lighting be controlled by condition and subject to this condition, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rImpact on Bats\rAs is noted in the Consultations section above, the Biodiversity Officer raised some concerns over the hours of illumination and how this could impact when Bats forage between October and November. However, noting that there are no equivalent restrictions at the neighbouring site which has a relatively recent planning permission for a similar form of development, Officers do not consider it would be reasonable to apply a condition restricting hours of illumination in October and November beyond what the applicant has stated in their submission.  On balance, it is considered that the potential impact on foraging bats in the vicinity would be acceptable when compared to the existing situation.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\rNo response received. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 194 - 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage or non designated asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development or cause any harm to the non designated heritage asset the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\rA condtion securing a fire safety strategy is recommended to ensure the development is fire safe in accordance with policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Application Site\rThe site is occupied by a two storey detached dwelling, and is a corner site located on the southern side of Lawrence Avenue where it intersects with Landseer Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\r\rThe proposal seeks to vary the approved plans of planning permission 22/00186/HOU for the Demolition of existing rear conservatory, erection of front porch, part two storey part single storey infill to side and rear extension with juliet balcony in first floor. Erection of roof extension with 1no rear and 2nos side dormers, installation of 3 nos front, 2 nos side  roof light to facilitate loft conversion. Formation of dropped kerb. \r\rThe application seeks the following: \r\rAmendments to the approved single storey rear extension to reduce the depth from 8m to 6m (near the common boundary with No. 28 Lawrence Avenue and increase the width by an additional 3.45m to span the full width of the dwelling (as extended). In addition, alterations to the fenestration to the north west facing flank have been altered to include a greater degree of glazing and a juliet balcony is now prepared to the second floor rear elevation. Originally full height openings and juliet balconies were proposed to the first floor rear , however, during the course of this application, amended plans have been received omitting these proposals. \r\rConsultation\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No representations have been received. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire safety\r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: In the context of approved application 22/00186/HOU, the proposed changes are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Although the previously approved application was considered acceptable (having regard to the established fallback position), the proposed scheme would only offer an improvement on the living conditions of the occupiers as the depth of the extension would be reduced by 2m.  No adverse impacts are expected from the increased glazing to the ground floor north-west facing elevation or the juliet balcony at seconfd floor level. In conclusion, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The application seeks approval the details required by Conditions 5 (Programme for part 4 of the Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Survey) and 6 (External Lighting) of Planning Permission 20/01702/FUL.\r\rCondition 5 states:\rNo above ground works shall commence until a detailed programme setting out the timeframe for the implementation of the recommendations set out within part 4 of the submitted Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Survey by Arbtech dated 29.01.2021 has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "The submitted proposed elevations do not have an annotated dimension. Please provide all  Proposed Elevations with dimension at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged.",
    "The LPA is legally obliged to maintain a register of planning applications in their area and the register must contain a copy of any accompanying plans and drawings. As such, the drawings must be made publically available. We would only redact any sensitive personal data. Furthermore, as part of the public consultation process the drawings must remain legible.",
    "We note that your architect has amended the Site Location Plan and added an orange line and hatched area. Please can you request that it is changed to a red line (which is our statutory requirement for Site Location Plans) and ensure that the access red line is not fragmented from the rest of the site. There must be one continuous red line around the whole site. \r\rThank you for confirming that you have notified your neighbours. This is on file.\r\rWe also note that we should use the architect's Site Location Plan when it is finalised, and not the separate plan, as you have requested.\r\rWe look forward to receiving the amended Site Location Plan.\r"
