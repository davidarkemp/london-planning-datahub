    "The Council considers the amendments to be non-material. It is therefore recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment to be granted.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey end-terrace dwellinghouse located on Beech Grove. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r14/14573/LDP - Erection of hip-to-gable and rear dormer roof extensions. Installation of rooflight to front elevation. Application Granted on 01 Sep 2014.\r\rConsultations\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. Whilst the proposed extension would exceed the recommended maximum depth of 3.5 metres as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please clarify the proposal. The application form only refers to the dormer roof extension, but the plans indicate garage conversion and demolition of conservatory. For the avoidance of doubt please amend plans to show the subject of this application."
