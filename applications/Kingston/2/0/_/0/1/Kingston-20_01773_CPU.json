    "The erection of a rear dormer roof extension and installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, on a corner of the junction where Selby Close and Garrison Lane meet.\r\r10x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would not be set back from the front elevation of the main dwelling and the ridge of the roof of  the proposed extension, would not be set down in relation to the main dwelling. Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD, states that:-\r\r\"Two-storey and first floor side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. In practice this means: the extension should remain subordinate to the original house\"\r\rFor semi-detached properties proposed Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD, goes on to state that side extensions should also: respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property; not exceed 50% the width of the original house; be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps; The roof line should be set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm; and the front elevation should be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house. \r\rThe roof line of the proposed first floor side extension would not be set down from that of the original house and the front elevation would not be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house. While the roof form would reflect that the existing dwelling, the first floor side extension would result in an overly prominent two-storey building which would project far forward of the established two-storey building line shared by properties along Garrison Lane. The development would appear especially discordant as the site occupies an elevated position in relation to Garrison Lane properties to the west.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would be an overly prominent and discordant addition which would detract from the relatively spacious character of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and Plans which demonstrate the provision of a suitable evacuation assembly point and fire safety measures within the proposed development to comply with the London Plan. However, officers consider the provisions of Policy D12 of the London Plan, could be met with a suitable Fire Safety Strategy, with a  condition, if a similar proposal were to be approved in the future.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r"
