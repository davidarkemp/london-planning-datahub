    "The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would not constitute a minor material amendment to planning permission 17/15257/HOU and the proposed enlarged dormer and hip to gable extension would create an incongruous addition to the host property and the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of that would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal therefore would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension, and hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer roof and installation of 2no. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Internal alterations and changes to fenestrations\r\rConsultations\r14 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would be approximately 5.3m deep and approximately 3.3m high. It is noted that the Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD recommends extension up to 3.5m deep. Furthermore, considering the type of the property (end of terrace house), relatively narrow garden and the scale of the existing rear extensions within the immediate surrounding area, the proposed depth of the extension is considered to be excessive and not in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 with regards to the set down and set in distances, however the similar scale, mass and bulk rear dormer roof extensions are noted on the adjoining property and within the immediate surrounding area, therefore Officers raise no objection to the proposed scale and mass of the rear dormer. The proposed hip to gable element and front rooflights are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the existing street scene. With regards to the proposed materials: zinc cladding and aluminium windows (it is noted that the proposal includes installation of new windows to the dwelling), they are considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe proposed zinc cladded canopy over the front door, given its siting and scale is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding street scene.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Based on the submitted information, the proposed rear extension would fail the 45 degree test in relation to the adjoining property No 57 South Lane in both, elevation and floor view and therefore it would result in unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to the closest habitable opening at No 57. Furthermore, given the excessive depth of the proposed extension and its design, it is considered to appear as an overbearing when viewed from No 57. \r\rLimited information has been submitted in reaction to the proposed chimney over the proposed ground floor extension.The applicant has not demonstrated that it would not have an adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining occupiers. \r\rWith regards to No 53 South Lane, given the separation distance and the existing rear extension at this adjoining property, it is considered that the proposed rear extension would not have a significant impact on the occupiers of this neighbouring property. \r\rIn relation to the proposed roof extensions, given its design, siting and scale it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Annotated dimensions must also be included on all Existing floor plans, site plans, elevation drawings, and section/level plans to show the key dimensions of any existing structures to be demolished/retained.
