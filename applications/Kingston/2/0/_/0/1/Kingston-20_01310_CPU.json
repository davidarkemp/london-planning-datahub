    "The development is permitted development under the provisions of schedule 2 Part 7 Class M of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the fenestration of the dormers to tile to match the existing, reduce the size of the first floor rear windows including amendments to the rooflights of the rear extension. The Council agrees that the amendments to which this decision letter relates are sufficiently minor in terms of their scale and impact (both individually and cumulatively) in planning terms, having regard to the overall scope of the previously approved development, so as to constitute a non-material amendment to the original planning permission/consent. This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
    "We have amended the Proposal Description for clarity. Please confirm that you agree with the following: \"Installation of 1no. internally illuminated fascia sign and 1no. internally illuminated projecting sign\""
