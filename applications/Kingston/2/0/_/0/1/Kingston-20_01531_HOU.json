    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale and design, would be wholly at odds with the form of the host dwelling and would be an unduly prominent and incongruous feature in the area, thereby resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by reason of the use of the second floor flat roof area as a terrace, would give rise to comprehensive views over 30 Henley Drive and would deprive the occupants of this property from a reasonable degree of privacy, thereby resulting in unacceptable harm to their living conditions. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 supporting representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r21/03964/HOU - Demolition of existing detached garage and erection of single story rear extension) - Application Refused on 27 April 2022.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed erection of single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Planning Application 21/03964/HOU was refused as a result of possible harm to amenity to the neighbouring properties, due to the submission of inaccurate plans. The applicant has resolved the issues concerning amenity, by submitting accurate plans showing levels and officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "We note that your application is to amend a previous planning approval. You must apply for these changes via one of two routes as follows:\r\r1) Householder application - Existing and Proposed plans must be submitted. The Existing plans must show the Existing situation, i.e. the same existing situation as the previous application, and the Proposed plans must show all proposals in totality, i.e. to include the previous permission and new proposals together. The 'Householder' application form must be submitted.\r\r2) Application to seek a Non-Material Amendment - this application will indicate the new proposals in relation to the previously approved plans, i.e. the Existing Plans will be the previously approved plans, and the Proposed plans will show the new side dormer window. The application form titled 'Application for a non-material amendment following a grant of planning permission' must be submitted.\r\rCurrently, your submitted plans do not specifically meet the requirements of either of the above options and you have submitted a Householder form. Please re-submit the application and plans via either the Householder, or Non-Material Amendment route.",
    "Inconsistent Plans - Proposed Plans PL03 and PL04 indicate dormer windows on both sides of the pitched roof, however they are only shown on one side on the Proposed Roof Plan PL06. Please check and amend where necessary.\r\rAlso there is only one First Floor side dormer window shown on the Proposed Site Plan and Floor Plan. Should there be a side dormer window shown on both sides at First Floor, as indicated by the Elevations at First Floor? Please check and amend where necessary."
