    "The proposed extension by reason of it's design and excessive size would disrupt the uniformity of the rear facade of the row of terraced houses which would result in a unacceptable adverse impact to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Council LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013 and the NPPF 2019.\r\rBy reason of its excessive depth the proposed single storey rear extension would fail to ensure a good standard of private outdoor amenity space for the existing and future occupants of No. 21 Blenheim Gardens. The development would be contrary to policy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013 and the NPPF 2019. \r",
