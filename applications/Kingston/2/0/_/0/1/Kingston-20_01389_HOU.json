    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any dormer windows in the side (east) elevation and any rooflights in the roof face of the side (west) elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the single storey extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the  materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The applicant is advised to resubmit with further evidence. Such an evidence should be detailed and specific to the proposal. \r",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two-storey terraced dwelling, located within the Fishponds Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for demolition of existing rear conservatory and shed, erection of single-storey rear extension and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front roof-lights to facilitate loft conversion. Erection of boundary wall and gate with hard-standing in front and rear garden.\r\rThe application follows a proposal 21/03645/HOU that was refused for the following reasons:\r\rThe proposed siting and design of the proposed rear dormer roof extension to the rear elevation, including the design and number of of proposed roof lights to the front elevation in relation to the rear dormer roof extension, would represent a development that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the streetscene or surrounding area; and would detract and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Fishponds Conservation Area.  The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 and the NPPF (2021).\r\rThe proposed materials to the roof of the proposed rear dormer roof extension use are not robust or appropriate for use in a Conservation Area and would not preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Fishponds Conservation Area. The proposal would therefore detract and fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 and the NPPF (2021).\r\rConsultation\r12 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposal. Two representations were received, one in support of the proposal and one objection on the following grounds:\r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): Object on the following grounds:\r\r'The roof lights to the front elevation should not extend above the plane of the roof. The large sliding windows to the rear dormer are inconsistent with the design of the property and the conservation area and would be visible from Mayberry Place and Fishponds Park. No objection from a Conservation Area perspective to the proposed single storey rear extension as this is not visible from outside the property and is consistent with other properties in the street.'\r\rRevised drawings have been submitted subsequent to the above objection showing the following:\r\rConfirmation the roof lights would not project above the plane of the roof;\rRevision of the sliding windows to the rear dormer - these have changed from one large window to two separate windows that match the fenestration style and proportions of the existing windows below.\r\rOfficers Note: The revised changes are considered to have satisfactorily addressed the concerns raised by the Surbiton CAAC.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the Conservation Area;\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Heritage\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 (Two-storey Rear Extensions), and Policy Guidance 39 (Dormer Windows) of the SPD Guidance are applicable to this application.\r\rThe application site is located within the Fishponds Conservation Area.  This area is summarised as the former mid century estate of The Fishponds, with the surviving core of the original house and part of the grounds laid out as a 20th century park. In addition there is  a cohesive set of late 19th Century, 2 storey terraced artisan cottages, with small front gardens. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension, although set down less than 500mm from the ridgeline of the existing roof, would be set in from the sides in accordance with the SPD. The dormer would be finished in materials to match the existing dwelling with an appropriate number and style of rooflights to the front elevations. Similarly to the rear the proposed dormer windows are sympathetic of proportions and design to match those existing on the rear elevation. \r\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension accords with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, and would accord with Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting and design of the proposed extensions officers do not consider the proposed development would unduly impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of loss of privacy, daylight/sunlight, sense of dominance, enclosure and impact to outlook from the rear windows of the properties at Nos.33 and 35 Browns Road.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing single storey rear extension and the erection of a replacement single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r1 letter has been received from a neighbour commenting that the the extension has partly built on neighbouring land. It is noted that the applicant has signed Certificate A on the planning application form indicating that they are in ownership of the land outlined in red and which the extension would be built on. Officers are satisified that the extension, as shown on the submitted drawings, would be built within the red line boundary indicated.\r\rAny dispute over the site boundary and land ownership would be a civil matter.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application follows a recent refusal (ref: 22/00417/HOU\r) which was refused due to inaccurate and inconsistent plans being submitted. The current application drawings accurately show the application dwelling and Officers can therefore assess the proposal. The extension would have a maximum flat roof height of 3m and a maximum depth of 4m along the shared boundary.\r\rAs the extension is situated to the rear and would be broadly proportionate and subordinate to the main dwelling, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that adjoining No. 4 Walton Avenue has planning permission for a single storey rear extension of 4m in depth and 3m in height (21/02970/HOU). It is stated that the neighbouring extension is currently being constructed. Were the neighbouring extension to be built out there would be no adverse impact resulting from the current proposal.\r\rIn the event that the neighbouring extension is not built out, there would be some loss of daylight/sunlight and an overbearing impact on the original rear elevation habitable room window at No. 4. However, given that the proposal is situated to the north of No. 4, it is not considered that this would give rise to any significant loss of sunlight. Overall, on balance, it is considered that there would be no significant adverse impact on No. 4.  No other properties would be affected by the proposals.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has  submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, it is not considered to robustly address all of the requirements of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021). Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Proposal Description - We have amended the description for clarity. Please confirm if you agree: \"Demolition of garage and erection of single storey detached outbuilding to rear to be used as gym\".",
    "We have received the email about the previous application 23/00519/CPU. The loft conversion is shown as proposed in the application 23/01487/HOU. If the previous planning permission has not been constructed and completed in the site, the description of this application needs to include loft conversion without previous application reference.  Please amend the drawings and documents accordingly.",
    "For the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Demolition of existing rear extension and erection of two-storey side and single-storey rear extensions with new porch. Hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights.'",
    "The proposal includes drop kerb, therefore please revise the location plan to show the red outline in the front pavement, where drop kerb will be proposed."
