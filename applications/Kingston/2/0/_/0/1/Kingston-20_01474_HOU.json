    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling house located on the corner of South Lane and Grayham Road. \rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension and alterations to the roof over the existing side extension.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed full width rear extension would project approximately 3m beyond the rear elevation and would be of a total height of approximately 3.3m, following Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe alteration to the existing roof over the side extension are noted and are considered acceptable in terms of the proposed scale, materials and design. \r\rThe proposed extension would be fully visible within the street, however given its modest scale, the proposed design and materials it is considered that it would not have significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIt is noted that the adjoining property No 62 South Lane benefits from the side extension. The proposed development would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to this property and therefore would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which is considered sufficient. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans.

The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the approved scheme by: \rEnlarging the proposed front and both sides dormers and new triangular loft window at rear elevation\r\rIn this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposed changes are not considered to be non-material.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Flood Risk Assessment; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed hip-to-gable roof extension would not be in keeping with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, as it would unbalance the roof forms of the pair of semi-detached properties, given that this aspect of the proposal could be completed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a credible fallback position.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer extension would not necessarily be appropriately set in from the sides or eaves of the roof slope, as per the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however given that there would be an element of set in from the roof slope, and that it would be finished in materials to match the original dwelling, officers consider that it would not appear a dominant addition to the host property. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed rear extension would have a depth that is in excess of policy recommendations (5.7m v. 3.5m), given that the proposed extension would have a stepped depth, and a modest height, officers consider that it would not overwhelm the host property, further given that it would be situated in a fairly substantial plot, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and modest scale of the proposed extensions on the boundary with the adjoining property, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of 49 Egmont Road by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rGiven that 53 Egmont Road is orientated further to the rear of the proposed extensions, and there would be a degree of separation between the flank wall of 53 Egmont Road and the proposed extensions, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk assessment states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Planning permission is sought for the demolition of existing conservatory and erection of single-storey rear extension.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals.  One representation has been received in support of the proposal subject to the external materials of the extension along the party wall remaining the same as the existing brickwork. A matter that is to be settled between the two parties outside of the planning process, although a condition would be imposed to ensure matching materials are used. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed single storey would replace the existing conservatory extension to a depth of 5.5m from the rear wall of the host dwelling (2m beyond the existing conservatory extension). Whilst the extension would not accord with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, the proposed extension would utilise materials to match the host building, would not be of an inappropriate scale in relation to the host dwelling, and other examples of deeper rear extensions are evident in the immediate vicinity of the application property. Officers therefore consider the proposed extension would have an acceptable impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would project beyond the neighbouring any further than the existing conservatory (to be demolished) however the conservatory to the neighbouring property at No. 35 Homersham Road is mostly glazed and as such the proposed extension is not considered to result in any additional adverse impact on this properties amenities in terms of daylight/sunlight or loss of outlook. No.31 Homersham Road is separated from the application property by a driveway to a neighbouring property. \r\r\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
