    "The development is considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r13x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would be set back from the front elevation of the main dwelling and the ridge of the roof of  the proposed extension, would be set down in relation to the main dwelling. However, the first floor side extension would not be set in from the shared boundary, which would not conform to the relevant guideline of one metre within the Residential Design SPD. Given that the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in this part of Vallis Way are largely retained at first floor level. The proposed development would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling by eroding gaps between neighbouring properties and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene and surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor extension would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD as mentioned above, given the separation from the proposed development and flank wall of the neighbouring property, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevation, it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, by reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No.34 Vallis Way, the proposed first floor side extension would appear as a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, erode the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in Vallis Way and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
