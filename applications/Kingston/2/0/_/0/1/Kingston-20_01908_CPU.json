    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site relates to Bishops Palace House, a three storey red brick building located on the riverfront, with a return elevation onto Clarence Street. It is in a prominent \"gateway\" location adjacent Kingston Bridge, which is a grade II* listed building. It includes a large retail store (TKMax) at upper ground floor, part basement and part first floor.\rThe site is within the area of the Kingston Area Action  Plan (KAAP), and is specifically covered by Policy P13, proposal site for Bishop's Palace House, which seeks comprehensive improvement of the site.\rThe site lies at the northern edge of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. It is covered by a number of policy designations  including, the Protection of Key Views,  the Thames Side Strategic Area of Special Character; the Thames Policy area;  it is within an Archaeological Priority Area Areas and is also within Environment Agency Flood Risk Zones 2, 3a and 3b. \r\rProposal\rThe proposal seeks to install 5 x air conditioning units on the flat roof area fonting Clarence Street. The units would be 2.2 metres in height and are shown to be enclosed  within a \"visual louvred screen\" with a footprint of 4.6m by 5.8m and an overall height  of 2.3m.\r\rConsultation\rKingston Conservation Area Advisory Committee:  Objection raised: New structure is intrusive on the sky line and clearly visible from the public highway.\rEnvironmental Health, no objection subject to condition\rNeighbouring occupiers: No response received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Heritage, Design  Character and Appearance of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rHeritage, Design, Character and Appearance\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. Additionally, Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area; and specifically Policy  DM10 (t) seeks to \"avoid locating structures, including, e.g. telecommunications equipment, building plant, advertisements and signs where they will be visually intrusive and likely to result in adverse effect on the character and visual amenities of the local and wider area.\" Core Strategy Policy DM7  is also relavant, and relates specifically  the Thames Policy Area and requires development proposals on the riverside to \"preserve or enhance the waterside character, heritage value and setting\". \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe site  is within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and Thames-side Strategic Area of Special Character,  the Thames Policy Area, and  adjacent to the Grade II* listed Kingston Bridge; it is also opposite the LB Richmond Hampton Wick Conservation Area.\r\rThe site is within a sensitive location in the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area lies in its historic status as an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period. It is close to the historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park and Richmond Park and the old core of the town around All Saints Church (Grade 1) and the  Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is the best preserved of its type in outer London.\r\rThe riverside area of Kingston Old Town Conservation Area has been evolving dramatically since its primary uses have changed from industry and trade, to residential and leisure use in the latter half of the 20th century. The construction of the mixed-use Bishops Palace House  in the late 1970s is one of the most significant of these developments.  The setting of Kingston Bridge and this section of the Thames riverside changed quite dramatically with the creation of 'Kingston Riverside' (Bishops Palace House).\r\rThe application site is within the setting of Kingston Bridge  - a key entrypoint to Kingston's historic core.The current proposal introduces a large structure on the roof of the building that would be visible in street views, including views from Kingston Bridge, where it would be visible in the foreground to views to All Saints Church tower, which is a grade 1 listed building and forms a focal point of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area.\r\rWhilst the existing building is not of any particular architectural or historic merit, the introduction of this large roof structure would detract from the setting of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area in this key historic entrypoint to  Kingston's historic core.\r\rParagraph 200 of the NPPF(2021) advises the grant of consent only where there is a clear and convincing justification to harm, which comprises the balance of planning benefits set out in paragraphs 201-203. The decision maker must consider the policy designations for the Site and any embedded design mitigation within the Proposed Development, in conjunction with planning benefits, such as those arising from the intensification of the land use.\r  \rIn conclusion, the proposal will result in the overall less than substantial harm.\r\rOfficers, cognisant of the Court of Appeal decision in Barnwell, note that a finding of 'harm' to the setting of a listed building or harm to a conservation area gives rise to a strong presumption against planning permission being granted. The presumption is a statutory one. It is not irrebuttable. It can be outweighed by material considerations powerful enough to do so. But an authority can only properly strike the balance between harm to a heritage asset on the one hand and planning benefits on the other if it is conscious of the statutory presumption in favour of preservation and if it demonstrably applies that presumption to the proposal it is considering. The less than substantial harm identified will have to be weighed up against any other public benefits associated with the proposal in the \"Conclusion/Planning Balance'' section of this report.\rIt is noted that the application is not accompanied by any supporting documentation relating to the Heritage setting, and has failed  to consider the impact of the proposal on the significance of the various heritage assets..\r\rOfficer's conclude that the proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area  and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 .\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light. Matters relating to noise could be appropriately controlled by condition\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
