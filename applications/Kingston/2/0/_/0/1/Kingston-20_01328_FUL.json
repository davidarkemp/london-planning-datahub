It would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and would be visually intrusive in the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
