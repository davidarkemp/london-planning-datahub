    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, samples of the facing materials to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The works shall be carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained in section 6 of the submitted Flood Risk Assessment by Unda Consulting Limited reference: 89908-MBOSS-RCS dated September 2020. \r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "No above ground works shall commence until a detailed programme setting out the timeframe for the implementation of the recommendations set out within part 4 of the submitted Preliminary Ecological Appraisal Survey by Arbtech dated 29.01.2021 has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved programme and a qualified Ecological Clerk of Works shall over see the works. \r\rReason: To safeguard the biodiversity and nature conservation value of the site, in accordance with policy G6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS3 and DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling. The site is located within Tudor Estate, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 23/02837/HOU - Erection of first-floor side extension and single-storey front porch extension. Installation of front rooflight. Alterations and modifications to internal layout. Refused 11.12.2023 for the following reason:\r\r1. By reason of its bulk, mass, spacing and design, the proposed development would not appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, would sit uncomfortably with the host building and surrounding properties and within the street scene which would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and would be detrimental to the visual amenities of the area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the newly proposed first-floor side extension would not maintain a 500mm distance from the front wall. However, it would have a set down from the ridge of the roof by approximately 800mm, in line with Policy Guidance 36 and it would now maintain the required 1m set in from the boundary. Therefore, omitting the previous concern raised regarding a terraced-like appearance. Additionally, the applicant has reduced the bulky appearance of the extension by reducing the scale and mimicing the pitched roof for of the existing dwelling, as such the proposed first-floor extension would not appear prominent in the streetscene. \r\rThe previously refused planning application proposed a porch that involved the enlargement of the existing porch which would have a width of approximately 3.5m, a total height of approximately 3.5m (encroaching the windows on the first floor) and a depth of approximately 1.5m. The newly proposed porch has been reduced in size with a width of approximately 3m. Whilst this may still appear slightly large in scale, similar porches can be found in the immediate vicinity and, as such would not be an incongruous addition in Latchmere Lane.\r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe applicant proposes to install a side at the first-floor level facing neighbouring property No.23 Latchmere Lane, as such, an obscure glazing and non-openable condition was put in place to prevent overlooking.\r\rGiven the proximity of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, the proposed development would generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD and would not significantly detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in significant harm to the Tudor Estate, a Local Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "This application seeks to discharge  Conditions 7 (SUDs)  of planning permission 23/01004/FUL (Relocation of primary pedestrian entrance, installation of canopy cover, removal of low-level retaining wall, alterations to car and cycle parking, landscaping and associated works)\r\rCondition 7 of planning permission 23/01004/FUL states:  Prior to commencement of groundworks to external areas, finalised details of the sustainable drainage system (in accordance with the strategy outlined within the Design and Access Statement prepared by BMJ Architects dated April 2023) shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The system shall be implemented and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.\r\rOfficer comment: The uFMfSW shows that area in the vicinity of the development site is at a very low risk of\rsurface water flooding. The LLFA Flood Risk Officer  has sought various updates and clarifications.  In response to drainage rates concerns, the applicant has maintained that the currently proposed discharge rates will provide significant betterment of the existing and reduced hardstanding. Noting the nature of the original development, which was a minor development, the LLFA advises  that after careful review of the submitted information, the SUDs details are satisfactory for the discharge of the associated drainage condition.\r\r",
