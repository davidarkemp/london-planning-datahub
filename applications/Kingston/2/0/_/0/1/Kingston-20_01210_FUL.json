    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rProposal \r\rSingle storey rear extension\r\rConsultation \r\rOne objection received and summarised below \r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rOfficer comment: The matters raised in the objection, character and appearance and neighbour amenity, are addressed in the officers assessment.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Whilst it is acknowledge that the proposed development may result in an increase in shadowing to the rear of the adjacent property 2 Welbeck Close due to the height and depth of the proposed extension it is considered that, on balance, the proposed development would not have any significant adverse impact on the overall amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. It is noted that the affected windows are north facing and that there is a degree of shadowing from the existing built form of the dwellings. Overall, it is considered that the neighbouring occupiers would still have a principle unobstructed outlook down their rear garden and an adequate provision of daylight/sunlight to the property over the course of the whole day.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development and flood risk and drainage; \r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would have a modest depth and height, and while it would have a slightly unusual roof form, on balance officers consider that the proposed extension would appear a modest and appropriate addition to the host property that would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any\rapplication.

Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD and would be in keeping with host property and would not detract from the character and appearance of surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site is an existing sports ground. The site is located in the designated Green Belt\r\rProposal \r\rPlanning permission is sought for the demolition of existing scout hut, maintenance shed, bungalow and clubhouse and replacement with new sports pavilion building, facilities maintenance building, car parking for 61 cars and 6 mini busses and associated hard and soft landscaping with access via Chessington World of Adventures. \r\rThe proposal is a revision/amendment of planning permission 17/10342/FUL which permitted with conditions \r\r(Erection of two new single storey buildings to replace the existing buildings on the site, replacement of the existing 3G sports pitch with a hockey pitch, erection of a new maintenance building and covered maintenance vehicle storage area. Proposed new parking area for 61 cars and 6 mini-buses and new vehicular access road.)\r\rIt is stated that the application is necessary as the revised proposal includes a series of minor revisions to the building design, an alteration to the car park an alternative location for the maintenance building and deleting the replacement of the existing\r3G sports pitch with a hockey pitch from the proposal. \r\rConsultation\r\rNo response received to the neighbour notification. \r\rLLFA Officer - No objection \r\rTree and Landscape officer: No objection \r\rEcology and biodiversity officer: no objection \r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: no objection \r\rSport England no Objection\r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to an existing sports ground in the designated Green Belt. The development proposal is for the purposes of replacing, adding to and improving the existing sports facilities on site. It is considered that the development would be an appropriate form of development in the Green Belt as outlined in Paragrapgh of the NPPF. As such it is considered that the proposed dvelopment is in principle acceptable. \r\rIt is considered that the built form of the proposed development would be of an appropriate mass, scale and design in regards to the sites size and surroundings and would be subordinate to its surroundings and be of an architectural style sympathetic to its surroundings. It is considered that the proposal would not harm the openness of the Green Belt and whilst visible would not be visually intrusive or detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rThe layout of the development proposal is considered to be of a practical nature and would have an appropriate mix of hard and soft landscaping. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rThe application has been reviewed by the LPA's neighbourhood traffic engineer and no objection is raised to the level of parking, servicing or highway safety subject to appropriate conditions. \r\rThe LLFA officer has reviewed the scheme in regards to flood risk and drainage and raises no objection subject to appropriate conditions \r\rThe LPA's tree and landscape officer has reviewed the scheme and raises no objection subject to appropriate conditions \r\rThe LPA's Biodiversity officer has reviewed the scheme and raises no objection subject to appropriate consitions. \r\rThe proposal would involve the use of the site by community beyond the principle user Shrewsbury House School. As such a community use agreement  is to be drawn up so as to control the use and it impacts and this is to be secured by condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Southborough Conservation Area. \r\rRepresentations:\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee - no objection.\r\rTree and Landscape Officer - additional information is required to ensure that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the protected trees.\r\r5 surrounding owners/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  No letters were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Southborough Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would be of a total height of approx. 3.7m and approx. 4.6m deep, it would join the existing single storey rear extension, which depth of approx. 3.7m would not change. It is noted that the proposal includes refurbishment and alterations to fenestration of the existing extension and existing balcony including addition of a parapet wall.\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth and height. However, considering its modest scale, the proposed design and materials and its siting, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rIt is noted that due to the existing boundary treatment comprising mature trees along the boundary with No. 3 Langley Avenue and the scale of the proposed development, the proposed works would not be visible from the street, therefore there would be no impact of the proposal on the existing street scene.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site falls within the Southborough Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless contributes positively to the conservation area. As the proposal would not be visible from the public vantage points and due to its scale, the proposed design and materials, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension and the proposed alterations would be in-keeping with the host dwelling, therefore the proposed development would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rProtected Trees\rOfficers note comments from the Council's Tree and Landscape Officer regarding outstanding information required to ensure that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the protected trees that are immediately adjacent on the boundary with No 3 Langley Avenue.\r\rThis information will be secured via a relevant condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "When submitting a new application the applicant is advised to provide a detailed Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan to demonstrate how the proposal would affect the protected trees.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Cleaveland Road. The site is situated within the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character. \r\rConsultations\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of a two storey rear extension which would extend  rear wall of the dwellinghouse. This extension would have a gable ended roof and would measure approximately 5.8 metres at its maximum height. Officers consider that the proposed two storey rear extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the original dwellinghouse and would be appropriate in scale and design. Officers also note that an extension of this proportion and design would not be uncharacteristic to a property along Cleaveland Road.  \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension which would measure approximately 6.4 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse. The extension would have a parapet wall and would measure approximately 3.3 metres at its maximum height. Whilst the proposed development would exceed the recommended depth as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, officers consider that this element of the proposal would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. \r\rThere would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light. However the application proposes the installation of one window on the side elevation facing the adjoining property at No. 7 Cleaveland Road. In the interests of the privacy of this neighbouring property, officers consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the recommendation in the event of an approval to ensure that this window is obscure glazed and fixed shut 1.7 metres above floor level.   \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within a Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character (LASC), which is considered a non-designated heritage asset. As also stated above, Officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the host property and the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows, that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Cleaveland Road/The Mall LASC.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application site is a two storey terrace building with a ground floor commercial unit and upper floor flats. \r\rThe building forms part of a small parade of shops designated as Kingston Hill and Park Road Local Centre but the site is otherwise in a predominantly residential area. \r\rThe existing building is not statutorily or locally listed and the site is not within a Conservation Area. The Park Road Conservation Area lies approximately 35m to the south east and the Princess Road; Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character lies on the opposite side of Park Road. \r\rThe site is within an Article 4 Area.\r\rThe site is within a CPZ (Zone B - Canbury Main Area)\r\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified with no responses received.\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rLoss of parking\r\rDesign \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD:\r\ro\tTwo storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling. \ro\tExtensions proposed on the boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted. \ro\tAdequate separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained (as discussed above).\ro\tAdequate daylighting and sunlighting of neighbouring properties should be maintained using the 45 and 25 degree principles discussed above. \ro\tOn narrow width properties - particularly terraced properties, two storey rear extensions are unlikely to be appropriate as they often result in an unreasonable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook for adjoining properties. \ro\tThe roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof and should not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof. \ro\tThe roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the 2nd floor. \ro\tFlat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building, and the use of a flat roof for a roof terrace or balcony at two-storey height will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rA 2.5 storey rear extension is proposed. Ground levels vary across the site and so the rear extension is set slightly lower than the main building, extending over 3 floors. The rear extension extends 6.3m from the main building to the extent of the ground floor extension and an additional 1.5m beyond the existing first floor extension (which has a pitched roof). \r\rWhilst the proposal will disrupt the balance and rhythm with the adjacent 57 Park Road (which has a matching ground/first floor extension), the proposed extension is discretely located to the rear and it is accepted that there are various other similar scaled rear extensions along this terrace and in the wider area.\r\rThe extension has a mansard roof design which differs from the main dwelling but it is accepted that there are a variety of room forms in the surrounding area and the mansard design is considered compatible with the host building. \rThe eaves of the extension sit below those of the main building and the ridge also sits below the existing ridge and rear dormer to the property.\r\rDue to its siting, the proposal will not impact on the nearby Park Road Conservation Area or Princess Road; Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rOverall, the proposed extension is considered acceptable by reason of its design, siting, form, scale and materials and would not result in a detrimental impact on the host property or character and appearance of the area. As such, the proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: The most affected properties are No. 61 and 57 Park Road and No. 26 Glenville Road. \r\rWith regard to No. 57 Park Road, the proposed extension extends only approximately 1.5m beyond the existing first floor rear dormer to this property. Given the limited extent beyond this dormer, this is not considered to be overbearing or to result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to this neighbour. There are no flank windows facing this neighbour and so there will be no loss of privacy also.\r\rWith regard to No. 61 Park Road, there is a small first floor window directly opposite the proposed extension but planning records for the neighbouring site indicate this to be a bathroom (non-habitable). There is a rear facing first floor window also serving a bedroom. Outlook will be affected from this window but the rear extension is set lower than this window with only the uppermost part of the extension and the mansard (which tapers away from the window) likely to be visible. On this basis, and given the existing constrained nature of the area, this is not considered to give rise to an overbearing impact for this neighbour. New rear facing windows will overlook this property but it does not appear to have any meaningful amenity space to the rear and any increased overlooking would not be significantly beyond the established level of overlooking in the area. A window is proposed on the side of the extension which would look directly towards the rear dormer of this neighbour but this serves a bathroom and can be conditioned as obscure glazed.  A 45 degree test has been undertaken which concludes that the extension will not result in an undue loss of daylight or sunlight to this window. \r\rWith regard to No. 26 Glenville Road, the proposed extension will directly faces the flank wall to this property which does not have any openings. It will therefore not be overbearing or result in any undue levels of overlooking to tis neighbour or its rear garden (which is located further to the south). \r\rFor these reasons, the proposed development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions. The proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rIt is noted that the proposed development is in the vicinity of a number of businesses within the Kingston Hill and Park Road Local Centre. The Environmental Health Officer has reviewed the application and raises no objection. It is therefore considered that the proposals would not give rise to any unreasonable restrictions on neighbouring businesses as a result of the proposed intensified residential use.\r",
