    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling, located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 23/00088/CEU - Retention of roof terrace and bridge. Approved 15.03.2023\r- 22/01929/HOU - Conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of single storey front extension, installation of bifold door in rear and internal alteration. Refused on 12.08.2022.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application with the same development description which was refused for the following reason:\r\rDue to the proposed bi-fold doors facilitating the use of the unauthorised terrace shown in the plans/elevations, the proposed development would harm the residential amenities by reason of loss of privacy. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant has subsequently obtained a Certificate of Existing Use for the retention of the roof terrace and bridge, which was approved. Notwithstanding, the proposed bi-fold door would be situation at the ground floor rear which is considered to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed front extension and garage conversion would be considered acceptable, as neighbouring properties on Kelvedon Road benefit from similar extensions and the extension would respect the design of the existing dwelling.\r\rOverall, officers consider the proposed development to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposals would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

It would maintain a sloped roof on the two-storey rear/side extension towards the southern side of the dwelling and would not be visible in the streetscene. \rThe proposed garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene, as it would not retain the existing garage door.

The applicant then submitted a non-material amended  for a flat roof instead which was refused for the following reason:\rThe proposals would result in a decrease in the overall height, however, the height of the extension would increase in proximity to the neighbouring boundary due to an increased eaves height. The proposed changes and potential impact on neighbouring amenity and character and appearance are therefore considered not to be non-material.\r\rThe proposed development under this application consists of single storey rear extension with a flat roof height of approx. 3.1m and a depth of approx. 3.5m falling outside the guideline set out in Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD.  However, the proposal would appear subordinate and propionate to the host dwelling and it would not be visible in the streetscene. \rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Officers acknowledge that neighbouring property No.6 Clippesby Close is the closet in proximity to the proposed rear extension. Although the existing window closest to the extension may be slightly affected, it would not be unacceptable as the door also provides light to the kitchen space.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.
