    "The application site is a detached two storey dwelling at the north end of Renfrew Road, Kingston.\r\rThe site lies within the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and an Archaeological Priority Area. \r\rThe site is designated as a TPO group area.\r\rThe site is adjacent to the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and there are various locally listed buildings in the wider vicinity. The site is also adjacent to the Coombe Wood Golf Course Site of Importance for Nature Conservation. The land to the north and east is designated Metropolitan Open Land.\r\rFlood Zone 1.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified with no responses received.\r\rGLAAS: no objections subject to condition/s.\r\rMalden and Coombe Conservation Area Advisory Committee: Object to impact of setting of Conservation Area\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign and Heritage Assets \rImpact on neighbour amenity\rLoss of parking\r\rDesign and Heritage Assets\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rLocal policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) require that proposals relate well to their surroundings, recognise distinctive local features, have regard to the historic environment and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.  \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD:\r\ro\tTwo storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling. \ro\tExtensions proposed on the boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted. \ro\tAdequate separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained (as discussed above).\ro\tAdequate daylighting and sunlighting of neighbouring properties should be maintained using the 45 and 25 degree principles discussed above. \ro\tOn narrow width properties - particularly terraced properties, two storey rear extensions are unlikely to be appropriate as they often result in an unreasonable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook for adjoining properties. \ro\tThe roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof and should not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof. \ro\tThe roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the 2nd floor. \ro\tFlat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building, and the use of a flat roof for a roof terrace or balcony at two-storey height will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rThe existing property has a large single storey pool house to the rear of the main dwelling. This is a lightweight glazed structure which occupies a significant footprint (approx. 110 sqm). The proposed extension would extend further to the north and west than the existing pool house at ground floor level with a first floor level above. The extension has a hipped roof form and would be linked to the main building at the first floor and roof by a lead roof element.  The extension would comprise a mix of brick, aluminium windows and a slate roof.\r\rRoof extensions are proposed to the existing dwelling which include altering the form of the roof (from a pitched to crown roof) and with additional dormer windows. The dormer windows are well designed, modest in scale and set down from the main ridge and up from the eaves. The roof extensions will increase the overall height of the building by approximately 1.5m and will increase the overall scale, mass and significantly change the appearance of the building. However, the proposal is considered to be well-designed and consistent with the scale, mass, form and design of other properties in the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed first floor extension to the existing pool house is set down from the ridge of the main dwelling (as amended) but extends the building significantly to the north and west.  The extension is significant in scale but this is considered proportionate to the scale of the existing building and plot size and comparable to other buildings of substantial scale in the area. The extension ties in with the main dwelling and is broadly consistent in design, form (hipped roof) and materials with the existing building (as amended). \r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. Given the surrounding area is characterised by properties of substantial scale, and for the reasons set out above, the proposal is not considered to result in harm to the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rThe site lies adjacent to the Coombe Wood Conservation Area. Its special architectural and historic interest is defined by Large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course.\r\rPart of Renfrew Road lies within the CA and the CA Statement describes this area as being laid out in 1908 and is lined with smaller scale detached dwellings. The properties are of varied designs typical of the Domestic Revival style of domestic architecture which incorporates elements of the Queen Anne, Arts and Crafts and early vernacular styles.\r\rWhilst the proposed roof and first floor extensions would be visible from the Conservation Area (particularly during the winter months) and would add substantial scale and mass along this boundary, the proposal would not be out of keeping with the substantial properties that line the edge of the gold course (and Conservation Area). This impact would also be softened by boundary screening, particularly during the summer months. For these reasons, it is not considered the proposed development would result in harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area by virtue of development within its setting.\r\rVarious other modest alterations are proposed including new and replacement windows and a new porch. These are considered acceptable and in keeping with the overall design of the building.\r\rHistoric England (GLAAS) were consulted and raised no objections to this application subject to a condition. \r\rOverall, the proposed extensions are considered acceptable by reason of their design, siting, scale, mass, height and materials and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character or the setting of the Coombe Wood Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is in accordance with the NPPF, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM 12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013). \r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe application site is adjacent to the boundary with The Canute and Simorg to the west. \r\rSimorg will be most affected given the siting of the rear extension. Given the separation distance of 29m between the first floor extension and this neighbour, it is not considered that the proposal would be overbearing or result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight. The same is the case regarding the roof extensions to the building given the separation distance of approximately 21m between the main building and this neighbour and the relatively modest addional height (1.5m). New dormer windows are proposed to the main building in addition to first floor windows on the proposed extension. The dormer is separated from the neighbour boundary by approx. 8m and would provide only oblique views towards this neighbour. The first floor windows are similarly set away from the neighbour boundary by approximately 8m and the neighbouring building itself by approx. 30m and, for these reasons, the proposal is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour. An external terrace is proposed to the new extension near to the boundary with this neighbour but a privacy screen has been included which is considered to sufficiently mitigate any harm. It is also not considered that the use of this particular part of the terrace would likely lead to any undue noise and disturbance. \r\rThe main building is separated from The Canute by approximately 23m. Given this separation distance and the modest additional height of the building, the proposed extensions are not considered to be overbearing or result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight for this neighbour. The two storey rear extension is not considered to affect this neighbour. A new dormer window is proposed facing this neighbour.  This is separated from the neighbour boundary by approx. 9m and from the neighbouring property itself by approximately 23m. Given these separation distances, this is not considered to result in an undue loss of privacy for this neighbour. \r\rFor these reasons, the proposed development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions. The proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer's comment:  The site is a designated TPO group area. A Tree Survey, Arboricultural Impact Assessment and Method Statement has been submitted with this application which identifies trees affected by the development and tree protection measures during the construction period. The Council's Tree Officer raises no objections to the proposals subject to tree protection measures being secured by condition. \r\rThe proposal is therefore in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rBiodiversity\rPolicy DM6 of the Core Strategy 2012 states that new developments should protect and promote biodiversity as part of sustainable design through the inclusion of sustainable drainage, tree planting, soft landscaping, habitat enhancement, green roofs and new or improved semi-natural habitats, where appropriate. The policy goes on to say that the Council requires an ecological assessment on major development proposals, or where a site contains or is next to significant areas of habitat or wildlife potential. \rThe site is also adjacent to the Coombe Wood Golf Course Site of Importance for Nature Conservation. A Preliminary Ecological Appraisal has been submitted which identifies the existing buildings as having bat potential and a badger sett is also present below one of the existing buildings. \r\rA Badger Survey has been submitted which identifies a badger sett on the site. The Badger Survey concludes that the sett is not active with no mitigation required but advises that further checks of the sett are undertaken prior to commencement of the development. The Council's Ecologist is satisfied with the findings of the survey, subject to the recommendations set out in the report. \r\rA Bat Survey has been submitted. Emergence surveys were undertaken which identified bat roosts within the existing building and using the site as commuting and foraging habitat. The Bat Survey recommends that the appropriate licences are sought from Natural England before commencing the development, that any external lighting is bat friendly and that bat boxes are incorporated into the design. Subject to this mitigation, the Council's Ecologist raises no objections to the application.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rSummary\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, \r",
    "Condition 3 (Materials) of planning permission 21/00617/HOU states:\r\rPrior to the commencement of any development above ground level, samples of the facing materials to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficer response:\rThe submitted information including samples of the proposed render finish with regards to Condition 3 of planning permission 21/00617/HOU is considered acceptable.  As such, this condition is hereby approved.\r\rCondition 4 (Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan) of planning permission 21/00617/HOU states:\r\rPrior to commencement of the development, a detailed arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. This submission shall include:\r\r(a) A plan to a scale and level of accuracy appropriate to the proposal, that shows the positions, crown spreads and root protection areas (RPA) of every retained tree on site, and on nearby ground or land adjacent to the site, in relation to the approved plans.\r(b) A schedule of pre-construction tree works for the above-detailed trees, where appropriate.\r(c) Details and positions of the tree root protection zones.\r(d) Details and positions of tree protection barriers and ground protection where appropriate.\r(e) Details and positions of the construction exclusion zones.\r(f) Details and positions of the existing and proposed underground service runs, to be routed to avoid root protection zones where possible.\r(g) Details and positions of any change in levels or the positions of any excavations within 5m of the root protection area of retained trees.\r(h) Details of any special engineering required to accommodate the protection of retained trees (e.g. in connection with foundations, service installation, bridging water features, surfacing).\r(i) Details of the working methods to be employed for the installation of drives, paths within the RPA's of retained trees in accordance with the principles of 'No Dig' construction. The details shall be in accordance with British Standard BS: 5837: 2005 sections 9.3, 9.2, 9, 11.7, 5.2.2 and 10 for requirements (c) to (h) inclusive.\rThe approved protection scheme shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement to ensure appropriate protection prior to demolition works, and in the interests of visual amenities and so that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rOfficer response: The Council's Tree and Landscape Officer is satisfied with the information provided for Condition 4 (Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan) of planning permission 21/00617/HOU.

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Reynolds Avenue. An area of the rear garden of the site is located within the Settlement - Chessington Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rPlanning History\r\rNo relevant planning history. \r\rConsultations\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
