    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front boundary treatment would appear notably higher than the existing low boundary treatment, however it is noted that there are a number of similar examples viewed within the surrounding area, and given that it would be finished in materials to match the existing dwelling, Officers consider it would not appear an incongruous addition to the host property or surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed front porch extension would have a depth that is in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however it would have an appropriate height and roof form and would be finished in materials to match the existing property. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed extensions in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light.\r\rThe proposal would include side facing rooflights, and to mitigate against any loss of privacy, a condition can be imposed to ensure that the openings is obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. \r\rThe applicant has provided visibility splays which demonstrates that the proposed gate would not obstruct views exiting or entering the site. Given that the proposed brick wall would not fall within the visibility splays, it is considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on pedestrian or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
