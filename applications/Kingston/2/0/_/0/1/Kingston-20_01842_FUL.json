    "The proposed development would discourage the use of sustainable modes of transport through the overprovision of on-site car parking spaces which would exceed the maximum standards for a property of this size and would therefore be contrary to paragraph 102 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).",
    "In the absence of an executed legal agreement the applicant has failed to demonstrate that existing and or future occupants of the site could easily and safely access their properties via car, which in turn could compromise highway and pedestrian safety and have an adverse impact on on-street car parking and congestion in the immediate vicinity. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy T6 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012), and the Sustainable Transport SPD (2013).",
    "By virtue of its siting, design and scale, the proposed dwelling would appear cramped and at odds with the prevailing pattern of development and the built form of the neighbouring properties. By virtue of its poor integration with the existing built environment, the development would fail to respect the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the noise emissions generated by the adjacent railway, particularly during the evening and night time hours, would not result in unacceptable living conditions for future occupants of the proposed dwelling. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policy DS3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS1, DM2 and DM10 of the Kingston-upon-Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a 1st floor gym (approximately 1,000sq m) located on New Malden High Street.\r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in use. The site is located in the designated New Malden District Centre. \r\rProposal \rErection of second floor side/rear extension\r\rRepresentations\r44 properties were notified of the proposal.  \r7 representations have been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Loss of privacy in relation to properties on Firman Close and Howard Road\r- Overbearing appearance\r- Loss of outlook\r- Proposal would increase noise levels\r\rOfficer response: The above concerns will be addressed within this report.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r19/02212/FUL Change of use of first floor from ancillary retail (Use Class A1) to a gym (Use Class D2) - Granted on 11.12.2019\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Highway safety\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site comprises approximately 1,000sq m gym located on the first floor, over the ground floor shop (Poundland). The proposed 2nd floor extension would provide  approximately 200sq m of  additional gym area. \r\rOfficers note the submitted plans are not consistent in showing the proposed dimensions of the extension, for example, the Proposed Second Floor Plan suggests the depth of approximately 25m, however when measured it only shows approximately 22m. The Proposed Elevations Plan, when measured, shows the extension approximately 26m deep. Furthermore, the submitted Proposed North Elevation does not indicate the 'steeped' elevation that has been captured on the proposed front and rear elevations.\r\rThe proposed first floor plan suggests relocation of the external fire escape stair, however it is not shown on the proposed elevation plan. \r\rThe applicant should note that submission of inaccurate drawings may invalidate any planning permission.\r\rBased on the submitted plans, the proposal appears to be significantly set back from the front elevation. Given the proposed width and height it is unlikely to result in an adverse impact on the existing street scene. \r\rHowever, due to submission of inaccurate and inconsistent drawings, it has not been possible to fully assess the impacts of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to  Paragraph 135 of the NPPF 2024, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the concerns received with the written representations regarding the impact of the proposal on the amenities of the adjoining properties to the rear of the application site (Firman Close and Howard Road). \r\rThe inconsistencies with the submitted drawings (as mentioned above) are also noted.\r\rThe BRE Site Layout Planning for Daylight and Sunlight provides guidance on the assessment of daylight, sunlight and overshadowing. The BRE guidance document states that \"If any part of a new building or extension, measured in a vertical section perpendicular to a main window wall of an existing building, from the centre of the lowest window, subtends an angle of more than 25° to the horizontal, then the diffuse daylighting of the existing building may be adversely affected. This will be the case if either:\r- the VSC measured at the centre of an existing main window is less than 27%, and less than 0.80 times its former value\r- the area of the working plane in a room which can receive direct skylight is reduced to less than 0.80 times its former value.\r\rRBK Policy Guidance 32, Figure 27 also clarifies how to take the measurements for the 25 degree BRE rule, which is from the centre of the window. The information submitted by the applicant Proposed Lighting Plan shows the 25 degree measurement in relation to the top of the window in the existing, adjoining properties, and has therefore not been correctly assessed.\r\rBased on the submitted drawings and in line with Policy Guidance 32, the application site as existing passes the 25 degree rule in relation to the nearest habitable windows on Firman Close. However, Officers have undertaken the assessment from the centre of the window and note that the proposal would fail it when the measurement is taken from the estimated centre of the window of the adjoining properties on Firman Close.\r\rThe submitted Daylight and Sunlight report refers to the habitable windows at Nos 104 High Street, 1 and 2 Firman Close (it is assumed based on the figures in the report that it actually concerns Nos 2 and 3 Firman Close). However, considering the accompanying Proposed Lighting Plan incorrectly demonstrating 25 degree rule, further information is required to demonstrate no adverse impact on levels of daylight received by Nos 2 and 3 Firman Close).\rFurthermore, it is noted that the report has not calculated the existing VSC levels. It relies on proposed VSC levels only, and advises that as all proposed  values are  above 27 VSC the  impact is compliant with BRE guidelines. However, Officers note that one of the values stated falls below 27 VSC.  No assessment annual probable sunlight hours (APSH) has been submitted.\r\rIt is noted that limited information has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposal would affect the other adjoining properties in terms of levels of daylight. For example, No 4 Firman Close, as per available planning history, has a habitable window in the side elevation and it is likely to be affected by the proposal.  No information has been provided to demonstrate how the proposal would affect the levels of daylight received by the adjoining properties on Howard Road. \r\rOfficers note concerns raised in relation to the impact of the proposal on levels of daylight received in the adjoining gardens. No information has been submitted to address this issue.\r\rWith regards to concerns raised with the written representations regarding the scale and mass of the proposal that could appear as overbearing and intrusive when viewed from the adjoining properties, due to significant inconsistencies in showing the scale of the proposal, Officers are not able to fully assess this aspect of the proposal.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a 'Gym Noise Breakout and Weight Drop Assessment' dated 27/08/2019  and 'Response to Acoustic Report - Nova Acoustics' which formed part of submission for the original application ref 19/02212/FUL (Change of use of first floor from ancillary retail (Use Class A1) to a gym (Use Class D2)) and it has not been updated to reflect the current proposal (ventilation). Officers note that neighbours have reported excessive noise from the existing gym, an updated assessment should be submitted for the proposed development.\r\rNo details for relocation of the existing ventilation system to facilitate extension and its possible upgrades (as stated in the submitted Planning Statement) have been submitted. \r\rOverall, due to submission of inaccurate and inconsistent and insufficient information, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not adversely affect levels of daylight received by the adjoining properties and would not appear as overbearing. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the plant noise levels would not adversely affect the adjoining properties. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 116 of the NPPF, 2024 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site is located within the PTAL Zone 4 which indicates good transport accessibility.  There are also two public car parks located within 200m - 300m walk from the site, Blagdon Car Park and Malden Centre Car Park. \r\rThe submitted proposed floor plans indicate provision of a cycle rack, which is misleading, as similar details were approved for the discharge of condition 6 (Cycle Parking) for the original application ref 19/02212/FUL. Given the significant increase in floor area and increase in number of employees, an updated cycle parking plan in line with minimum standard as shown in Table 10.2, Policy T5 London Plan is required.\r\rOfficers note the submitted Construction Phase Plan November 2024, however it does not reflect the requirements of a Construction Management Plan (CMP), which would be required pre to commencement of the development and could be secured via condition.\r\rWhilst the proposal would not adversely affect the highway safety (subject to a Construction Management Plan), it is considered that insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposal would provide an adequate cycle parking, contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Proposed Fire Plan, which covers some of the requirements of Policy D12(A). However, a more detailed Fire Safety Statement will be required to ensure that the development achieves the highest standards of fire safety and fully addresses the requirements of Policy D12(A), as is set out within the London Plan Guidance - Fire Safety, details of which would be secured via condition.\r\rThe updated statement should address all the following criteria:\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. The Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence.\r\rThe required Fire Safety Strategy shall reference the London Plan Guidance Fire Safety (February 2022) where applicable and a Reasonable Exception Statement (RES) should be submitted in relation to those fire safety requirements which the applicant does not consider to be relevant.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Accurate and consistent plans must be submitted for any forthcoming applications. \r\rThe site address must be clarified as it is different to the address on the decision notice for the original application ref 19/02212/FUL or to the address shown on the gym's website.\r\rOfficers note various reports submitted that relate to the planning permission ref 19/02212/FUL, any relevant documents must be updated and include the current proposal.\r",
