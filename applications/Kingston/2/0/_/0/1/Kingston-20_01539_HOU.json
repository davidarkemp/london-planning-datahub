    "The proposal would result in the unacceptable loss of a large Category A TPO tree and damage to two protected Category B trees which make a significant and positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. The proposal would fail to preserve the character of the conservation area, resulting in less than substantial harm, for which there would be no public benefit to outweigh the identified harm. The proposal would be in conflict with paragraph 196 of the NPPF 2019, Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy 2012 and with policy guidance 7 of The Residential Design SPD, 2013. \r",
