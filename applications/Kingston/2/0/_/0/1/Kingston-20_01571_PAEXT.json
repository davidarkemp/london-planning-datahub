    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would be situated within the curtilage of No 21 The Crescent, therefore the proposed single storey rear extension would not fall within Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe applicant seeks a non material amendment to planning permission ref: 20/00825/FUL (Variation of Conditions 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, 9, 13, 14, 20, 22, 34 & 36 of planning permission ref: 17/14178/FUL) to add one window to the west elevation at ground floor level of Block C.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the alterations would not give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the area or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers given the scale and siting of the proposal. Accordingly, the changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling. A tree covered by a Tree Protection Order (TPO) is located within the rear garden. \r\rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission  for an erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r11 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rTree and Landscape Officer - no objections\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Protected Tree; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would measure approximately 2.8m in depth and height and would therefore accord with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Given its modest scale, the proposed design and materials to match the existing ones, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposed extension would pass the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest habitable openings of both adjoining properties in elevation view. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rGiven the siting and the scale of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact on the protected tree. It is noted that the Council's Tree and Landscape Officer did not raise any objections to the proposal.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
