    "The erection of hip to gable roof extension, rear dormer extension and installation of 2no. x front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey property with commercial premises at ground floor and residential at first floor, on the west side of Surbiton Road.\r\rProposal\rReplacement shopfront, signage and awning (Retrospective Application)\r\rThis application relates solely to the changes to the front of the property and any development to the rear including the extractor fan has not been considered as part of this application.\r\rOfficers note that this application follows a previous refusal 21/00363/FUL dated 10.08.2021. This was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1. The development by reason of its size, materials and proximity to the public footpath would detract from the character of the area and would increase the sense of enclosure of the public footpath to the detriment of its users. The proposal is considered to be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r2. It has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of noise and disturbance contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficers note both reasons for refusal related to works at the rear of the property and not the shop front.\r\rConsultation\r68 neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r\r- Previous applications have been refused, the design is inappropriate,\r- Impact of the rear extraction system\r- Inaccuracies on the application form\r- Highway impacts\r\rThe objection also noted the height of the awning may obstruct cyclists on the nearby cycle lanes.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer - No objection\r\rGo Cycle/Sustainable travel officer - No objection - The awning will be a full metre away from the cycle lane so there is no issue at all, and at 2.5 min height that would be enough clearance in any case.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed development would result in the loss of the original stall risers from the front elevation. Officers acknowledge that there is a mix of styles of shop fronts along Surbiton Road, whilst the proposal comprises a modern style, it is nonetheless considered to not harm the character and appearance of the host property nor of the wider area. it is also acknowledged that a number of properties also benefit from awnings to the front. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\r\rThe issues raised by the objector are noted and have been taken into consideration, the issues with regards to errors on the application form are not material to the assessment of the application. The concerns with regards to cyclists are noted and have been addressed above - see comment fro the Council's Go Cycle team. The retrospective nature of the application is noted, however this is not a material consideration, please see above the reasons for the previous refusal, this related to the works to the rear. The comments about the extraction system are noted however they do not form part of this application. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
