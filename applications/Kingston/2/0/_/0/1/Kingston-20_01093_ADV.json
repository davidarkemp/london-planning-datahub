    "The site comprises a detached dwelling which falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and Kingston Hill Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r23/00922/FUL - Demolition of existing dwelling, erection of 2no.s three-storey, semi-detached houses with basement and detached garage. Erection of front and rear boundaries with 2no. new vehicle access points from Kingston Hill and 1no. new vehicle access point from Warboys Road. Planning Permission Granted on 01.08.2023\r\rDevelopment Description\rDemolition of an existing shed, single garage and rear extension, erection of two storey front, rear and single storey side extension. Hip to gable roof extension with 3nos front dormer, rear dormer and balcony. Erection of a single storey rear outbuilding double garage, front boundary with pillars, railings and gates. Formation of drop kerb, new pedestrian and vehicular access. Fenestration alteration.\r\rThe proposed development has changed significantly from granted planning permission ref: 23/00922/FUL. The applicant has omitted plans to demolish the existing dwelling and construct 2 nos three-storey semi-detached dwellings but rather proposes to demolish the existing shed, single garage and rear extension, to develop the existing dwelling which would serve a single dwellinghouse.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets;\r- The impact upon the residential amenity of neighbouring residents;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters;\r- Impact on trees.\r- Fire Safety Assessment;\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development consists of the demolition of an existing shed, a single garage and a rear extension to allow for the erection of a two-storey front and rear extension and a single-storey side extension. The application also involves the erection of a hip-to-gable, a front roof dormer and additional roof alteration/extensions to the front and rear of the dwelling. \r\rAs mentioned in planning permission 23/00922/FUL, Kingston Hill extends for a considerable distance, and offers a varied pattern of development at different stages along its length. The segment on the west side between Warboys Approach and Ladderstile Ride, including the application site, is characterised by a row of detached houses standing on relatively wide plots. Apart from their generally tall front boundary walls and fences, the houses are set out in a conventional suburban arrangement, facing the road in a generally consistent alignment. None of the houses are of any obvious outstanding design merit. Other lengths of the road, including that opposite the site, show a less consistent pattern, although they also comprise detached houses. Officers note that in a slightly wider area, including those roads off to each side, there is greater diversity, including some quite densely built terraces.  \r\rThe proposed development no longer includes the subdivision of the existing plot or the insertion of a pair of semi-detached houses which would have been of a different form. The retention of the single dwellinghouse would better fit the streetscene and not be considered out of character with the wider area. The proposed development has been reduced in width and, therefore still would not appear overly dominant or bulky. The overall pattern of a row of substantial houses addressing the road would be maintained, whilst the effect on prevailing density would be minimal.  \r\rIn terms of the overall footprint of the proposed dwellings, as well as the ratio of built form to the undeveloped proportion of the plot, this appears to conform with neighbouring properties and is therefore acceptable. It is noted that the existing dwelling occupies a smaller massing and footprint than many of the surrounding properties and, so, represents an opportunity to develop to better align with surrounding properties.  \r\rThe front building line along Kingston Hill is somewhat irregular and the front face of the proposed buildings would be set back from its neighbours to the south (i.e. Ahirvad House), which is considered to be appropriate. Whilst forward of the neighbouring property to the north at Manor Cottage, the built form would not encroach upon the 45-degree line to this neighbour. Similarly, the rear building line would generally be in line with each of the neighbouring properties, Manor Cottage and Ahirvad House.   \r\rThe proposed building would take some cues from surrounding properties but given the range of ages and styles of dwellings present in the area, there is no prevailing style that it could seek to replicate. Aside from this, the dwellings would be of a high quality, making good use of features and a palette of sympathetic, traditional materials. \r\rThe existing front boundary is formed by a high dilapidated wooden fence with overgrown ivy and trees growing around it. In its current state the boundary treatment makes limited contribution to the streetscene and Area of Special Character. The proposals include white rendered brick wall boundary treatment and black railings. The application proposals are considered to enhance the boundary treatment and generally complement nearby properties. \r\rGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would generally be in keeping with Residential Design SPD and would not be an odd addition within the vicinity of Kingston Hill, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and the Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development does not occupy a significantly larger footprint to the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed dwelling would still include a recessed balcony to the second-floor level. Officers recognise that the design of the balcony set deep with an overhanging roof slope helps to achieve greater privacy than a traditional projecting balcony would otherwise. The balconies would allow the windows to be recessed back into the building and adhere to a stepping back approach at each floor level going upwards. The proposed design helps to limit the potential for overlooking into gardens by virtue of the proposed inset of the railing on the balcony recessed into the building's footprint, whilst the dormer roof shape on the 2nd floor prevents any overlooking that could occur sideways from the balcony level to each neighbouring property's garden area.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013  seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The existing vehicle access to the site from Warboys Road would be maintained in order to access the proposed garage and an additional vehicle crossover is proposed to the front of the dwelling from Kingston Hill.\r\rThe councils' Vehicle Crossover Policy, April 2020 states that an opening size, minimum of 2.7m and maximum of 4.0m must be provided at the back of the footway, measured at right angles to the public highway. The proposed vehicle crossover on Kingston Hill would have a width of approximately 4m complying with the Vehicle Crossover Policy.\r\rTherefore, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on highways safety, the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rTrees and Landscape\rParagraph 174 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by, among other things, recognising the benefits of trees and woodlands.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees there should be adequate replacement based on the existing value of the benefits of the trees removed, determined by, for example, i-tree or CAVAT or another appropriate valuation system. The planting of additional trees should generally be included in new developments - particularly large-canopied species which provide a wider range of benefits because of the larger surface area of their canopy.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected. Where trees are to be lost through development, the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: The site falls within Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character which, amongst other things, is notable for its high-quality public realm as a result of its mature and varied landscaping. \r\rThe Council's Tree & Landscape Officer has reviewed the submitted details and submits no objection to the proposed development, as it would have no impact on any trees or landscapeof any significance. However, the applicant has not submitted a detailed landscape and planting plan, this would be sought by way of condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 22/01104/FUL:\r- Removal of the initially proposed basement floor.\r- Addition of 2 rear windows.\r- Reduction of the projection of the front elevation.\r- Changes to bay window in the front elevation.\r- Alteration to the drop kerb, to consist of 1 dropped kerb instead of 2\r\rWhilst the changes to fenestration to the rear elevation may be considered acceptable independently, the proposed changes as a whole would have a potential impact on character and appearance and are therefore considered not to be non-material.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the application be refused.",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed side/rear extension would be visible from the street, however, it would be reasonably small in scale and would appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling. Additionally, it would not be incongruous in the wider area, as a similar extension can be seen in Buckland Road.\r\rThe proposed front extension would still be in keeping with the fenestration pattern of the existing site and would adequately maintain the appearance of the street scene. It is considered the proposal would not cause a significant negative impact on the street scene of Buckland Road.\r\rOfficers note that the outbuilding would have a large footprint, however, it would have a modest height and given that it would be situated in a fairly substantial rear amenity area, officers consider that it would appear as a subordinate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed dormer would not strictly comply with Residential Design SPD in regards to retaining 500mm distance from the sides, eaves and ridge of the roof, would not mimic or resemble the existing pitched roof form but rather proposes a flat roof and it would not be highly prominent within the street scene. However, it is noted that dormers of a similar form and scale have been built in the wider area. Furthermore, the dormer extension could likely be accomplished via permitted development rights. Within this context, on balance, it is considered that this element of the proposal would be acceptable.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposed development would not adversely impact the character or appearance of the area and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed side/rear extension, using the BRE guidance, and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties and in comparison to the existing shed and conservatory layout, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- RBK Core Strategy 2012;\r- Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of 2nos hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with juliet balcony and installation of 2 nos front roof light to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\rDC 23/02577/CPU  Erection of 2nos hip to gable roof extensions with installation of front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Granted 22.11.23\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : Officers note that the principle  for the erection of 2nos hip to gable roof extensions was established with the approval of application ref: 23/02577/CPU  on 22.11.23. However, the totality of the proposed development which is the subject of this planning application would not be permitted development.\r\rOfficers note the proposed rear dormer extension is sufficiently set down from the ridge line of the existing roof. However, it is not set in from the sides of the roof by at least 500mm, nor is it designed to complement the character of the existing house with its excessive width.  Overall, the proposed roof dormer would appear overly dominant and as a bulky addition to the roof slope.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer  would present a set of windows which line  up with the original windows below. It would also present   large french type windows enclosed with a juliet balcony. The proposal also seeks to raise the chimney stacks above the ridge line in order to comply with Building Regulations. This alteration would change the roofscape, however Officers consider these changes to be proportionate and acceptable. \r\rThe proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk and design It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. The totality of the proposed works would not be permitted development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.

    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a terraced dwelling. It is noted that site levels vary between properties on the south side of Tankerton Road and that site levels fall away from the main dwellinghouse towards the rear end of the garden.\r\rIt is noted that Nos. 36, 40 and 42 Tankerton Road are all identified as being at low-medium risk of surface water flooding.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension with terrace\r\rConsultation\r7 neighbours were notified of the application. 1 letter of objection has been received raising the following concerns:\r- Insufficient details of surface water drainage and unconvinced that the extension is sufficiently set-in from No. 42 to keep rainwater within the boundary of the application site;\r- Increased surface water flood risk on-site and to neighbouring properties;\r- Ground levels at No. 42 are approximately 0.15m - 0.3m lower than the application site;\r- Loss of privacy from the patio;\r- Height of boundary fence/privacy screens;\r- Loss of daylight and overbearing appearance;\r- While the patio has been reduced in depth the extension has been increased in depth meaning that the overall depth and height is still unacceptable;\r\rOfficer Note: Mares tail is not a listed plant under a relevant Act (such as The Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 or the Environmental Protection Act 1990) so as to be relevant for planning purposes.\r\rPlanning History\r\r23/02051/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension with terrace - Refused 27.09.2023 for the following reasons:\r\r1. The combined height and depth of the proposed extension, terrace and necessary privacy screens/boundary treatment would have an unacceptable overbearing impact and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining No. 42, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\r2. The proposals include a significant increase in hard surfacing and the application site and neighbouring properties are identified as being at low-medium risk of surface water flooding. In the absence of any drainage details, it is has not been demonstrated that the proposals would not increase flood risk on-site or elsewhere, contrary to Policy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy SI 13 of the London Plan 2021 and Paragraph 167 of the NPPF (2021).\r\r3. The combined height and depth of the proposed extension, terrace and necessary privacy screens/boundary treatment would result in a prominent, visually intrusive and incongruous development which would be highly visible from neighbouring properties which would harm the character and appearance of the area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2021).\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings;\r- Flood Risk\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Following the previous refusal the applicant has now submitted plans which are accurate and consistent.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be 3.5m in depth (0.5m greater in depth than the previously refused proposal), a maximum height of 3.825m and an eaves height of 3m. The proposed materials, white render and a tiled roof, would be acceptable.\r\rThe proposed terrace would be situated at the same floor level of the extension and would have a depth of 1m and a height above site ground level of approximately 0.5m. \r\rThe previously refused scheme proposed a terrace of 0.5m in height with a depth of up to 4.5m. The previously proposed extension had an overall height of 3.825m and an eaves height of approximately 2.9m. In combination, the refused extension, raised terrace and necessary privacy screens would have resulted in development of at least 2.5m in height (when viewed from neighbouring No. 42) for a depth of approximately 7.5m (c. 2.9m in height for the 3m extension).\r\rIn comparison, the current extension and terrace would have a combined depth of 4.5m with the height of the extension and necessary privacy screens remaining unchanged. Given the overall reduction in depth of development from c. 7.5m to a maximum of 4.5m, it is considered that the development would be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the dwellinghouse which would not be overly prominent when viewed from neighbouring properties. It is considered that the third reason for refusal has been addressed.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that Nos. 40 and 36 are separated by an alleyway. The separation distance between the properties is considered sufficient to ensure no significant adverse impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, overbearing impact, undue sense of enclosure or loss of privacy.\rRegarding adjoining No. 42, as is noted above, the application site appears to be set at a higher ground level than No. 42. The proposed single storey rear extension would pass the so-called BRE '45 degree rule' in relation to daylight which indicates that there would not be any significant loss of daylight to the closest habitable room window at No. 42. \r\rWhile the depth of the single storey rear extension has increased by 0.5m when compared to the previously refused scheme, the raised platform has been reduced in depth from a maximum of 4.5m to 1m. The set-in from the site boundary of the extension would be approximately 0.2m. Within the context of the significant reduction in patio depth (and the privacy screens which would have been required) it is considered that the combined impact of the single storey rear extension and rear patio area and necessary privacy screen would not result in any unacceptable overbearing impact or undue sense of enclosure to No. 42. \r\rSubject to a privacy screen of 1.8m in height (when measured from the upper surface of the proposed raised platform) being erected on the sides of the raised platform, it is considered that the development would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbours. The first reason for refusal of planning application ref: 23/02051/HOU has therefore been addressed.\r\rFlood Risk\r\rParagraph 167 of the NPPF (2023) states that: 'When determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere.'\r\rPolicy DM4 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will require development to be designed to take into account flood risk from fluvial and surface water flooding and that development proposals will be considered in accordance with national guidance and the Borough Strategic Flood Risk Assessment (SFRA). Policy SI 13 of the London Plan echoes the above requirements. \r\rIt is noted that Nos. 36, 40 and 42 Tankerton Road are all identified as being at low-medium risk of surface water flooding. \r\rWhen compared to the previously refused scheme, the raised platform area has been reduced from approximately 25.2sqm to approximately 5.5sqm. While no detailed drainage measures have been submitted as part of the current planning application the applicant has confirmed their agreement to a pre-commencement drainage planning condition (see Conditions 5 and 6). \r\rThe pre-commencement planning condition will require a final detailed drainage design and maintenance schedule to be submitted for approval in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved system would have to be implemented prior to the beneficial occupation of the development.\r\rGiven the significant reduction in scale of the proposed raised patio and the applicant's agreement to a pre-commencement planning condition requiring the submission of a final detailed drainage design for approval, it is considered that the development would not increase flood risk on site or elsewhere. It is therefore considered that the second reason for refusal of planning application:  23/02051/HOU has been addressed.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
