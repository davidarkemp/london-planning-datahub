    "The details submitted for Condition 19 (Design Details) of planning permission 20/01105/FUL, would be sufficient enough to allow discharge of this condition.\n\nThe applicant will need to either enter into a s278 Highways agreement for works to create a crossover onto Lovelace Gardens or alternatively arrange for the work to be undertaken by the Council under a s184 Crossover application procedure.

The applicant or their contractor must not undertake any works on the public highway without a s278 agreement being in place.\n",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site sits within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\n\n9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 representations from 1 household and North Kingston Forum have been received relating to:\n\n- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\n- Inappropriate design/layout\n- Loss of light/Sunlight\n- Privacy\n\nThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below\n\nProposal\nThe current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/02404/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the scale and siting of the proposed extensions at first and second floor levels. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in an unsatisfactory form of development, and one that is not characteristic with the established pattern of development within the surrounding area to the detriment of the streetscene. Given the scale of the balconies to the rear, the proposal would have also resulted in a loss of privacy for 106 and 100 park Road. Officers note that the current proposal has made a number of changes including; the removal of the balconies, setting back the first floor side extension from the front elevation, and reducing the depth of the first and second floor extensions. Therefore, it is considered that the previous reasons for refusal have been addressed.\n\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development;\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- Fire Safety Assessment.\n\nDesign\nWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposed roof extension with gable ends would alter the character of the original roof form. However, it is also noted that the original dwelling appears a somewhat standalone structure amongst the surrounding detached properties, a standalone structure, which whilst a good form of architecture is not a notable feature in the wider area that adds to the character and appearance of the area. While the proposal would alter the character of the original dwelling, it would be finished in materials to match the existing property, and would appear in keeping with the existing gable roof ends viewed within the immediate area.\n\nThe proposed two storey side extension would generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nOfficers consider that the proposed roof extension with parapet wall from the rear would appear rather boxy, however officers note that it would largely follow the original roof line, which would soften the appearance. Further, given that the original dwelling currently appears significantly smaller than the neighbouring properties, officers consider that the proposed development would be in keeping with the appearance of surrounding development within the area.\n\nOfficers note that the proposed first floor rear extension would have a flat roof which would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however officers note that the parapet wall would be constructed to follow the outline of the original dwelling, which would visually soften the appearance of the flat roof. Further, given that the proposed first floor rear extension would be set in from the shared boundaries and would have a modest depth, officers consider that the proposed extension would not detract from the appearance of original dwelling or surrounding area.\n\nThe proposed ground floor rear extension would not have a depth that is in keeping with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however it would have an appropriate height, and as such it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original dwelling or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nOfficers note that the separation between properties would be reduced however large gaps between properties is not a feature of the immediate area, and as such the reduction in the space between properties would not erode any established character.\n\nAmenity\nPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: While the proposed extensions would further fill out the site, officers note that the proposal would maintain separation distance between neighbouring properties. In particular it is noted that 106 and 110 Park Road do not feature any side windows facing the proposed development, and as such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\n\nOfficers note that the proposed development would introduce openings to the side elevation at first and second floor level, and to mitigate against any loss of privacy for the occupants of neighbouring properties, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition ensuring the window is obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\n\nWhile the proposed first floor rear extension would feature a flat roof, officers note that there is no existing access to the roof and as such could not be used as a balcony, which would be further controlled by a condition if planning permission were forthcoming. As such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\n\nThe comments about light entering rooflights of neighbouring properties is noted, and the proposed development would reduce daylight, however, such a reduction (and resultant levels of daylight) would not be uncommon in an urban area, and as such Officers raise no concerns with this.\n\nNon-designated heritage assets\nParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\n\nPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\n\nOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would result in a change to the character of the original dwelling, however the proposed extensions would make use of materials to match the host property and the surrounding area and would appear in keeping with features and developments viewed within the immediate setting. As such, officers consider that the proposed extensions would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it.\n\nFire Safety Assessment\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nIn conclusion, the representations received have been carefully considered, and subject to conditions Officers conclude that the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
