    "The erection of a single storey garden room/outbuilding to the rear falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class E of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site sits within Flood Zone 3b. The site also sits within Riverside South Conservation Area and Thames - Side Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r162 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 9 objections have been received relating to:\r\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Noise\r- Storage of hazardous substances\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe proposal is for a minor extension and will not alter the existing car parking provision on site. The proposal would also not result in the storage of hazardous substances. As such, the remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rEnvironmental Agency - The proposal is classified as minor development and as such is covered under flood risk standing advice. However, if approved the EA does not object subject to the applicant submitting a flood risk activity permit. \rRBK Pollution Control - No objection\rLondon Borough of Richmond - No Objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Flood Risk and Drainage; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would appear modest in scale and would propose materials to match the existing building, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would be modest in scale and as such would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe proposal would marginally increase the floor space, and would only enclose a small section of the premise, and as such it is not considered that the proposal would allow for an substantial increase in the amount of people accessing the space. Therefore, it is not considered that the proposal would result in a material increase in noise and disturbance.\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 3b (high probability). The Flood Zone 3b (functional floodplain) definition is adopted to ensure that future development is steered away from the most 'at risk' flooding extents from fluvial sources. Given that the proposal is for minor development, consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied in the first instance. \r\rParagraph 166 of the NPPF 2021 states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment. This includes all development within Flood Zones 2 and 3.\r\rOfficer Comment: The EA has identified that the proposal would fall under the vulnerability classification 'less vulnerable' and as such table 3 of the PPG sets out that development under 'less vulnerable' should not be permitted within FZ 3B with no possibility of exception. The EA has stated that they do not object to the proposal, and if planning permission were granted they would require the applicant to complete a flood risk activity permit. \r\rAs mentioned above, in the first instance the LPA should apply the relevant standing advice set out by the EA for minor developments.  The proposal would fall under 'less vulnerable' and the standing advice states that developments that are 'less vulnerable' should not be permitted. While it is not possible to provide an exception test or sequential test to combat this decision, in any case Officers note that the applicant has not provided any flood risk assessment in support of the application.\r\rUltimately, it is the responsibility of the EA to take a strategic overview of the management of flooding, and to provide evidence and advice to inform policy. However, it is the responsibility of the LPA, in its role as Lead Local Flood Authority, to develop a strategy for local flood risk management and to take responsibility for managing the risk of flooding within the borough. As such, given that this type of development would not be appropriate within Flood Zone 3b, Officers consider it likely that the proposal would lead to the increase of flood risk on site and elsewhere, as such the proposal would not be in line with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Riverside South Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. As previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Scale Bar Issue - the scale bars on Plans 301, 302, 303, 304 and 400 do not measure correctly at the stated scale, e.g. they measure 6.5m, not 5m at the scale of 1:50. It is noted that these scale bars are formatted differently to the other plans where the scale bars are correct. For the avoidance of doubt, please amend the scale bars.\r\rPlease only re-submit plans which have been amended."
