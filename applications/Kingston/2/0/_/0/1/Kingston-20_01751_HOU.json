    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The window situated at first floor level in the northern flank elevation hereby permitted, shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the northern flank walls of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

    "Condition 5\r\rThe applicant has not adequately demonstrated that condition 5 (Secure Cycle Parking), of planning permission 22/02039/FUL can be discharged. The information submitted is of insufficient detail to clearly demonstrate that the terms of the condition have been met.\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate the dimensions of the area being used for cycle parking and:-\r- how much space will be available for the parking of cycles;\r- how many cycles the applicant estimates can be stored in the  rear area;\r- what type of product will be used e.g Sheffield stand, will be used for securing cycles and whether this provision will be sheltered; and,\r- the methods of lighting and surveillance for cycle parking  to be provided.\rIn accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Condition 6\r\rThe applicant has not adequately demonstrated that condition 6 (Travel Plan), of planning permission 22/02039/FUL can be discharged. The information submitted is of insufficient detail to clearly demonstrate that the terms of the condition have been met.\r\rThe applicant's submitted Travel Plan does not have any specific, measurable and timed targets. Instead iii seems to only list additional measures, including implementation of the travel plan itself.\r\rAs such the Travel Plan is not considered to be acceptable in Highways terms and not in accordance with policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r\r",
