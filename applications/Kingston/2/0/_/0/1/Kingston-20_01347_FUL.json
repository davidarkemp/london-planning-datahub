    "The proposed development, by reason of its scale, form, siting and design, would be an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Ewell Road street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultation \r\r23 objections received and summarised as follows\r\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car Parking\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Fumes\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- Mental Health \r- Illumination \r- Fire safety\r- Tables and chairs on the highway\r\rKT CAAC Objection There is limited information here about the exact look/colour of the\rsignage & our impression is it would be too bright and modern in\rdesign & would not maintain the character & appearance of this listed\rbuilding & its historic setting.\r\rRBK Pollution control officcer - lack of information on levels of illuminance/method of illumination to properly comment\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mixed use commercail and residential building and relates specifically to the ground floor commercial unit.\r\rAssessment\rThe application is for the display of advertisements and as such the main considerations are as follows:\r\rAmenity \rPublic safety \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. It also states that developers should avoid locating structures, including, e.g. advertisements and signs where they will be visually intrusive and likely to result in an adverse effect on the character and visual amenities\rof the local and wider area\r\rThe applicant has provided insufficent level of detail as to how the signage is to be illuminated to demonstrate that the proposed illumination would not caise harm to the character and amenity of the area and as such would not accord with Section 66 and 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF, Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r",
