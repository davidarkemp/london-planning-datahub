    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows in the side (west) elevation and situated at first floor level shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the single storey extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "CONSULTATIONS: \rNo representations have been received. \r\rHistoric England: Authorise delegated determination. No views expressed on the proposal.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS: \rThe application site (The Gatehouse or The Keep, attached walls and railings) is located on Kings Road. \r\rThe site is Grade-II listed, but does not lie within a Conservation Area. \r\rPROPOSAL: \rFull planning permission is sought for proposed works to the brickwork to include demolition and rebuilding of parts of the East & West boundary walls to include repointing of existing brick work and vegetation growth removal from wall. New foundation to be laid and anchors supports. \r\rASSESSMENT: \rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the current Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. \r\rThe key planning considerations relevant in the assessment of this application are set out under the headings below: \r\rImpact upon the Listed Building: \rThe principle of conducting repair work to a heritage asset is acceptable subject to compliance with the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and Development Plan policies. \r\rSection 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states that 'In considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.' \r\rNPPF provisions: \rIt is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. \r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 202 goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rThis application proposes repair works including the demolition and rebuilding of parts of the East & West boundary walls of The Keep which includes repointing of existing brick work and vegetation growth removal from the walls. A new foundation will be laid and anchor supports installed. The works are intended to prevent the further collapse of the east and west boundary walls. \r\rNo works are proposed internally and no external works are otherwise proposed to those stated above.\r\rHistoric England advises that in those instances where repair works are proposed which is necessary to sustain the heritage asset, this is normally desirable if: \r- There is sufficient information to understand comprehensively the impacts of the proposals on the significance of the place; and \r- The long-term consequences of the proposals can, from experience, be demonstrated to be benign or the proposals are designed so as not to prejudice alternative solutions in the future; and \r- The proposals are designed to avoid or minimise harm, if actions necessary to sustain particular heritage values tend to conflict. \r\rThe extent of the repair should typically be limited to what is reasonably necessary to make failing elements sound and capable of continuing to fulfil their intended functions. \r\rRepairs to brickwork should accurately match the bond, colour, texture, dimensions and pointing of the original brickwork. \r\rAny features such as rubbed brick arches or decorative mouldings should be retained, and where necessary repaired or reinstated. \r\rExisting collapsed coping stones and bricks have been collected and stored for reuse. As a temporary measure, timber fencing has been installed to safeguard neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposals involve general repairs following the removal of unstable / dangerous sections of the wall. Use of remedial ties are proposed. Partial rebuilding of sections of the wall which are bulging significantly is proposed. Bricks will be removed in sections in order to cut out roots to cracked bed joint and the wall reinstated locally. Ivy to be cut back below top of the wall so that the wall top can be examined for cracking/defects associated with ivy roots. Instances of spalled bricks have been identified. Treatment to consist of cutting out each individual spalled brick, matching brick inserted and bedded in with mortar to match as close as possible (1:1:6 mortar). Pointing to be finished slightly recessed from face of wall.\r\rTaking into consideration the submitted plans and supplementary heritage information, the proposed repair works to the brickwork are deemed to be appropriate as the least interventionist and most sympathetic approach for the repair which would improve the overall character and appearance of the heritage asset. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade II Listed structure, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the heritage asset as per the requirements of the NPPF 2021.\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located in Mayfair Avenue.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular constraints or policy designations.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension and first floor side extension following demolition of existing conservatory.\r\rConsultation\r12x neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor rear extension would be in accordance with the Residential Design SPD and would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. Officers Comments: The application site benefits from an existing cat-slide roof and proposes the construction of a first floor side extension. The proposed extension would be set back from the front elevation by 0.5 metres to retain the cat-slide roof form. The proposed side extension would therefore appear subordinate to the dwellinghouse, and would preserve the character of the dwelling and the cat slide roof. The proposed development would not unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires a proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider in relation to amenity is the adjoining semi-detached dwellinghouse at No. 40 Mayfair Avenue. The application proposes the construction of a single storey extension projecting 3.0 metres to the rear of the host property. Whilst there is currently shrubbery on the boundary with this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy to an unacceptable degree.\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which complies with the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r",
