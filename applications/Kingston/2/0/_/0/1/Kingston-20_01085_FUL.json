    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to: \r\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear/side infill extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  While the proposed extension would sit in close proximity to neighbouring property 66 Malden Hill, given that the kitchen at ground floor level benefits from openings on both the side and rear elevations, and that the proposed extension would not extend further than the rear elevation of the dwelling house, officers consider that the proposed extension would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 66 Malden Hill by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. Given the existing boundary treatment on site, officers consider there would be no loss of privacy for the occupants of 66 Malden Hill.\r\rGiven the separation distance and that the proposed extension would not extend further than the rear elevation of the dwelling house, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of 70 Malden Hill by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe representations received are noted, the concern with regards to privacy with windows looking into the side shared space can be overcome through the erection of a replacement fence if indeed the current fence is removed. No evidence has been submitted that shows that such a course of action cannot be adopted, if indeed necessary. Comments about the use of the ground floor room as a bedroom instead of living room as noted on the plan is noted, however, the use of such a space for such purposes would not require planning permission and as such is not part of this application. In any event any concerns can be addressed through the erection of boundary treatment. In addition, a condition has been imposed to require the windows to be obscurely glazed below 1.7m. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "PROPOSAL: \rApplication under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with condition(s) Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission 21/01000/FUL (Erection of 7 bedroom detached dwelling with attached triple garage and dual level basement (following the demolition of existing house)) to allow for the following changes for removal of approved basement. \r\rPREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY:\rApplication reference 21/01000/FUL -Erection of 7 bedroom detached dwelling with attached triple garage and dual level basement (following the demolition of existing house). Granted planning permission, dated 20th September 2021.\r\rCONSULTATIONS:\r27no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No representations received.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe application site comprises an area of approximately 0.25 plus hectares on the northern side of Warren Park, a private estate built in the 1950s. The area is characterised by large two-storey detached properties set within spacious gated grounds and with an established, mature tree cover. \r\rThe application property is not listed. The site falls partially within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area (i.e. part of its rear garden is within the designated CA). The site is also within the designated Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The site is located within the Kingston Hill Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rPROPOSAL\rApplication under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with condition(s) Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission 21/01000/FUL (Erection of 7 bedroom detached dwelling with attached triple garage and dual level basement (following the demolition of existing house)) to allow for the following changes for removal of approved basement.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development, impact upon character and appearance, including heritage assets and impact upon neighbouring residential amenity.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission.\r\rIt is acknowledged that there is no statutory definition of a minor material amendment (MMA) although the Planning Practice Guidance (PPG) explains that a MMA is 'likely to include any amendment where its scale and/or nature results in a development which is not substantially different from the one which has been approved'.\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area, including Impact upon Heritage Assets\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAccording to Paragraph 206, local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas and within the setting of heritage assets in order to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area.\r\rFeatures of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rKingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character\rThe significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough.\r\rNoting that the proposed building would continue to be of a high quality design and that those trees on the site which are to be removed would are not significant or high quality specimens and that replacement tree planting would be undertaken, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in harm to the significance of the Strategic Area of Special Character, subject to the imposition of a condition to secure equally high quality landscaping. Such a condition is recommended accordingly.\r\rCoombe Wood Conservation Area\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th-Century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course.\r\rThe application site does not in its entirety fall within the boundaries of the Conservation Area; rather the rear half of the rear garden falls within the Conservation Area boundaries. The question is whether the proposal would affect its setting and, if it would, whether that effect would harm its significance.\r\rThe NPPF defines the setting of a heritage asset as: \"The surroundings in which a heritage asset is experienced. Its extent is not fixed and may change as the asset and its surroundings evolve. Elements of a setting may make a positive or negative contribution to the significance of an asset, may affect the ability to appreciate that significance or may be neutral.\"\r\rThe proposals would see the originally approved dual-level basement removed from the proposals, so that the proposed dwellinghouse would instead have accommodation from ground floor up to second floor (converted roofspace). Officers also note this Section 73 application additionally proposes some changes to fenestration, with some windows as originally approved removed (i.e. two ground floor full length windows and one small rooflight to the western side elevation now removed, and one door removed to the eastern side elevation). \r\rOfficers consider that the proposal would not affect the ability to appreciate the significance of Coombe Wood Conservation Area and that the overall effect of the proposal on the Conservation Area would be neutral i.e. the proposal would preserve the setting of the Conservation Area.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and wider area.\r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Residential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rThe proposed changes resulting from the proposed removal of the dual level basement and changes to the fenestration would not have a materially different effect on the character and appearance of the property and would not give rise to any detrimental impacts upon neighbouring amenity. The proposed changes to the fenestration would not involve the addition of windows but, instead, shows the reduction of windows to the side elevations. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of material loss of light, outlook or privacy.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed amendments to condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission reference 21/01000/FUL are considered to maintain appropriate good quality design and would not result in material difference in terms of character and appearance of the proposed development, nor in terms of impacts upon neighbouring amenity. The proposals are considered to comply with Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.  \r\rRECOMMENDATION\rGrant planning permission.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Although the proposed rear/side extension would be constructed on an existing raised patio, it would not be out of keeping with similar rear extensions in the wider area. Additionally, the proposal would relate well with the host dwelling by means of the proposed pitched roof form and it would generally respect the guidance within the Residential Design SPD in terms of height and depth. Therefore, it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed hip-to-gable rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that it would unbalance the roofs of the pair of semi-detached properties, however officers note that the adjoining property benefits from planning permission for a hip-to-gable extension ref: 22/00532/HOU, and even if this is not built out, officers note that the proposed extension would benefit from permitted development and as such officers consider this credible fallback position. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposal in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rWhile openings are proposed at second floor level on the south-west elevation, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure these openings are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.
