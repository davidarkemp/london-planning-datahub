    "The following additional condition is inserted:\r\r6. Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, the new rooflights at first floor level in the south-western (front) and north-western (flank) roof slopes shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "The Council considers the amendments to be non-material. It is therefore recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment to be granted.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal \rReplacement of existing ground floor rear extension roof with dark grey fibreglass/GRP layer and installation of 1no rooflight. Changes to fenestration. New timber bin store in front garden.\r\rConsultations\r14 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alterations to the roof would include addition of a roof parapet wall resulting in the total roof height of approximately 3.3m, in line with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe proposed roof replacement, erection of a roof parapet wall and proposed changes to fenestration (blocking the openings to the side elevation of the existing rear extension, replacement of windows to the first floor side elevation and alterations to the existing ground floor window to the side elevation) are considered acceptable from a design point of view. They would relate well to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed siting, layout and materials of the refuse store are considered acceptable. \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIt is noted, that the proposed addition of a parapet wall resulting in a total height of approximately 3.3m would not change the existing situation in terms of levels of daylight/sunlight received by the adjoining properties. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for condition 15 (Construction Management Plan) of planning permission 21/01000/FUL have been assessed and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Construction Management Plan and Traffic Management Plan -Rev. A drawing to describe the proposed arrangements for managing construction vehicle movement, contractor parking and ensuring highway safety. It is noted that Warren Park is a privately maintained road within the Coombe Estate. As such, the creation of the new temporary bell mouth does not require a highways agreement.\r\rThe routing of all construction traffic vis Kingston Hill is agreed.\r\r",
    "The submitted proposed block plan also shows the rear extension,  if this application does not include any extension, please revise accordingly.",
