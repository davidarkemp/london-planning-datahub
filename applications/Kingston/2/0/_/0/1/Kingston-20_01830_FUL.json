    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is located within the Walpole Road, Local Area of Special Character.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on trees.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed side extension would have a width of approximately 9m and a depth of approximately 8.8m and the first floor would be concealed within the extension's roof. This extension would be in replacement of an existing garage.\r\rPolicy Guidance 36 (Two Storey Side Extension) (PG36) of the Residential Design SPD states that extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. The most relevant PG36 guidance in this case is:\r\r- the extension should remain subordinate to the original house;\r- the roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form;\r- features such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house in terms of their style and positioning;\r- the line of the roof's eaves should run with that of the original dwelling;\r- the roof line of the side extensions should either follow that of the existing roof or be set down from that of the main house by a minimum of 500mm, and\r- the extension should either be designed so that it appears as an integral part of the existing house, or where appropriate, set back from the front wall of the existing house by a minimum of 1m.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge that the proposed development would not maintain a setback from the front elevation of 1m, this would not appear odd as the existing garage sits at a similar position as the extension. Additionally, the proposed extension would have a roof form that respects the host dwelling and resembles the roof of the existing garage, appearing as an integral part of the existing dwelling. The proposed material use and fenestration would resemble and respect the host dwelling. \r\rTherefore, on balance, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 209 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: Walpole Road is part of the Oakhill Local Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset, which can be characterised as an area that consists mostly of a number of attractive detached 2-storey detached Edwardian houses of townscape character, often set in gardens containing mature trees and shrubs. Additionally, on Walpole Road, the red brick and tile-hung houses give the road a cohesive Edwardian Character.\r\rAs noted above, the proposed development would generally be in keeping with the Residential Design SPD and would not significantly detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in significant harm to the Walpole Road Local Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, '45 Degree' Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting and distance of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer comments: Officers note that there are 2 Tree Preservation Order Groups on site; 1 for Bhutan Pine and 1 for Box Elder. These trees contribute positively to the character and appearance of Walpole Road, therefore, great care must be taken when considering development around or near these trees. Officers acnowledge that the applicant has not submitted an arboricultural method statement (AMS), however, the councils Tree and Landscape officer has assessed the submitted details and confirms that no trees are being removed and only small shrubs if needed for access which are below 75mm, therefore they raise no objection.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
