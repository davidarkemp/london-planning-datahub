    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would be appropriate in this case and would accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "N/A",
    "Informative no.2\r\rThe applicant is  reminded that in granting approval under Class AA of the GPDO (2015 as amended), requires the development to be completed within a period of 3 years from the date of this permission, and that before beginning the development.\r",
    "The Site\rThe application site comprises pavement outside No. 22 Claremont Road, which is a busy pedestrian route leading to Surbiton Railway Station. It also provides vehicular access to the Waitrose car park. \r\rThe proposal site is located within Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area and Surbiton District Centre.\r\rCommercial premises on the east side of Claremont Road are designated shopping frontages. The Locally Listed Buildings situated on the east side of Claremont Road are Nos 2 - 24 Claremont Road. The Grade 2 listed building, Clock Tower, is located in close vicinity to the application site. \r\rPlanning History\r22/01594/FUL - Proposed installation of 1no. new BT Street Hub (following removal of associated BT kiosk) - pending consideration \r\rConsultations\r- Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer - No objections \r- Borough Environmental Health Officer -  No objections; information regarding construction work hours will be added as an informative\r- Surbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee - No objections\r\r54 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance; and,\r- The impact of the development on Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings, and\r- The impact of the development on highways. \r\rCharacter and appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application is for display of advertisement on two 75 inch screens housed on sides of the proposed Hub. The proposed Hub would be of modern appearance, it would be made of steel for the main structure with a powder coated  aluminium exterior. Displays would be made of tempered and toughened laminated glass. \r\rThe application proposes a static method of illumination and the maximum daytime brightness level of 2500 cd/m2, with a night time maximum of 600 cd/m2.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed display would be an appropriate addition to the streetscene, and would not appear visually intrusive or create visual clutter. It is considered that the signage would not create adverse light pollution. It is considered that the proposed signage would not detract from the character and appearance of the streetscene. \r\rHeritage Assets\rWhen read together, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 189 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed display screens would be acceptable in terms of scale, form and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposal. \r\rHaving regard to the above, Officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Given the scale, form and design of the proposal, it is considered not to have a detrimental visual impact upon the occupants of nearby properties or natural surveillance. As stated above, the proposed illumination levels of the signage would be appropriate in the site context and would be controlled by condition. As such, the proposals are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rHighway Safety\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway information or directional signs. The application proposes for the maximum daytime brightness level of 2500 cd/m2, with a night time maximum of 600Cd/m2, in line with the recommendations of the Institute of Lighting Professionals, the application site would be considered an E4 Zone (Urban). For digital signs, the Institute of Lighting Professionals recommends that the levels of illuminance for signs of this size should not exceed 5000cd/m2 in daylight hours. \r\rOfficers therefore consider that the proposed signage would not have an illumination level that would be a nuisance to vehicle and pedestrian users and the proposed signage would not act as a distraction to highway users or prejudice highway safety. Therefore it is considered that the proposal would comply with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
