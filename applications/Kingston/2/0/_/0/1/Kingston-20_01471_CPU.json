    "The proposed alterations to the windows would amount to development under section 55(2)(a) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and therefore require planning permission. The works would fall outside the scope of the Town and Country Planning General Permitted Development Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Temporary obstructions during the proposed works must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic.",
    "The recently submitted architect plans show a proposed single storey rear extension. The Block Plan also shows a proposed rear extension. The plans do not show what is being applied for.\r\rTo re-iterate, Existing and Proposed Floor Plans must be provided to show the proposal, and they must be scaled accurately. We must be able to assess the size of the new bedroom.\r\rAs a suggestion, we recommend that your architect amends the plans as follows in order to retain the correct scale:\rExisting Floor Plans - re-title Plan 04 and the drawings with \"Existing\" not \"Proposed\", and mark up the location of the existing snug room which is to be changed. Add annotated dimensions to the plan.\rProposed Floor Plans - re-provide Plan 04 as \"Proposed\" and mark up the location of the proposed new bedroom. Add annotated dimensions to the plan.\rThe Project Title should not be \"Ground Floor Rear Extension\" - please amend.\r\r"
