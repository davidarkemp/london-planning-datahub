    "The proposed development would fail to provide an appropriate amount of living space in relation to the size of the properties. This would lead to a cramped form of development that would be detrimental to the residential amenity of future residents, contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would fail to provide an adequate amount of garden space for residents to enjoy, and as such contrary to their amenity. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal would fail to provide cycle parking facilities that are secured, sheltered and adequately lit, with convenient access to the street. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS6 and DM8 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would discourage the use of sustainable modes of transport through the relative overprovision of on-site car parking spaces in this particular location. Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that vehicles would be able to access and egress the site, for the purposes of utilising the proposed 3 on-site car parking spaces, in a forward gear which could pose highway safety issues, contrary to Policies T6, T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).",
