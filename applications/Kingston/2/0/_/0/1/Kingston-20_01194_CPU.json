    "The proposed fence and gates are not considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 2, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "\rThe site comprises a two storey terraced dwelling, located in the Cadogan/Cleaveland Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a single storey infill to side extension.\r\rRelevant Plannning History: \r\r15/16526/HOU- Erection of single storey rear infill extension. Refused on 09.08.2015\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets, and;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed single storey extension would match the depth of the existing outrigger creating a full width rear extension. Whilst the extension would exceed the parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, it is of a modest eave and parapet height with a pitched roof to minimise the built form along the shared boundary. The proposal is also consistent with rear development in the immediate vicinity of the site including recent planning permissions. External details would match the host dwelling.\r\rIt is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application property falls within the Cadogan/Cleaveland Local Area of Special Character (LASC) which is a non-designated heritage asset. The built form of this area is characterised by predominantly Victorian housing and in the southern part of this area e.g. Cleaveland Road and surrounding streets, terraced houses on narrow sites prevail.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would not be uncharacteristic of development within the immediate vicinity of the site or surrounding properties.  Given the siting of the development and considered design the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Cadogan/Cleaveland (LASC).\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the siting of the proposed extension the principal property to consider is No. 78 Cleveland Road. In this case, the extension is sited on the shared boundary and in excess of the SPD parameters in terms of depth. Whilst the pitched roof design helps to minimise the impact of the extension, the closest window at No.78 Cleaveland Road is a glazed door and the only source of sunlight/daylight to this habitable room which would be unduly impacted on by the proposed extension.\r\rIt is therefore considered that the proposals would unacceptably affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of sunlight/daylight \r\rFire safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and Plans which demonstrate the provision of a suitable evacuation assembly point and fire safety measures within the building to comply with the London Plan. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "We have received the email and documents confirming that the application 23/00695/HOU is not for a loft conversion, however the proposed elevations show hip to gable roof extension. Therefore for the avoidance of doubt, please confirm the description 'Erection of first floor side extension with twin hipped roofs. Erection of hip to gable roof extension.' \rIf you do not agree with the description, please amend the description in your own words or amend the proposed elevations and other documents as necessary.\r"
