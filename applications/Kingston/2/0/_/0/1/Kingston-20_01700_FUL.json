While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application, unless varied through the proposal.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstance since the granting of the original permission.\r\rDesign and Character\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers Comment: \r\rThe proposal is for a change to the rear ground floor part of the building. Previously, this part of the building stepped away from the adjoining neighbours with a flat roof at a height of 3.3m. The proposal now extends to the boundary at a consistent depth but the height has been reduced to 3m.\r\rThe amended design does not diminish the design quality of the overall development and is therefore in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8, DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\rStandard of accommodation\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires developments to provide adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD requires new residential dwellings to provide 50sqm of private garden per family house (+ 5sqm per extra bedroom over three) where the prevailing character of the area allows.\r\rPolicy D12 of the London Plan requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rThe overall floorsapce of the building has increased slightly but, otherwise, there are no changes that would affect or diminish the overall standard of accommodation. \r\rNeighbour Amenity\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficer's comment: The proposal now extends to the boundary with adjoining neighbours but the height at the boundary has been reduced by 300mm to 3m. \r\rWith regard to No. 37 Berrylands, the plans indicate a neighbour extension considered through 22/03915/FUL. This application was refused and so no weight is given to this and the existing building line will be used to calculate the assessment. The proposed building extends approximately 3.3m beyond the rear building line of this neighbour. Given this limited depth, and the reduced height of 3m, this is not considered overbearing for this neighbour. \r\rWith regard to No. 41 Berrylands, the proposed building extends approximately 5m beyond the rear building of this neighbour. Given the proposed building is set in from the neighbour boundary by approximately 0.8m, and the height has been reduced to 3m, the overall change in comparison  to the previous scheme is not considered to an impact that would be overbearing for this neighbour. \r\rOfficers have undertaken a BRE daylight assessment (45 degree test) based on the proposed drawings and drawings the Council has for the neighbouring No. 37 Berrylands. No drawings are available for No. 41 Berrylands but an estimate (but reliable) assessment can be made based on site photos (indicating bifold doors to the neighbouring building) and the proposed drawings. Given this neighbouring building is set in from the neighbour boundary (as is the proposed building) and has bifold doors, it is evident that the proposed building would not interrupt the 45 degree line at a height of 1.6m. With regard to No. 37 Berrylands, it appears evident that the proposed building (which extends practically to the boundary) would also not interrupt the 45 degree line to the mid-point (at a height of 1.6m) of the neighbouring large double doors. On this basis, it can reasonably be concluded that the proposal would not result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to neighbours. \r\rIn summary, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions. The proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rConditions\rSome of the conditions attached to 22/00420/FUL have been approved/discharged but all other conditions can be re-attached to this permission. \r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above. \r",

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor restaurant. The upper floors are residential in use. It is located in the Kingston Old Town Conservation a designated heritage asset.\r\rConsultation \r\rNeighbour notification - one response in objection received in relation proximity of illuminated sign to residential windows\r\rKTCAAC - object on grounds of internal illumination and materials proposed. \r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity \r\rThe signage would be on the front and rear of the building. The site fronts High Street and at the rear faces onto the KIngston riverside and towpath. \r\rThe building occupies a prominant position in both the street and riverscape. It is considered that the proposed acrylic/vinyl finish of the proposed signage would not be of a sympthetic addition to the host property exacerbated by the internal illumination and would detract from its character and appearance and cause less than substanstial harm to the designated heritage asset, the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area by failing to preserve or enhance its character and appearance. \r\rThe signage would sit directly below residential windows and it is considered that the method of illumination could give rise to light pollution that would be harmful to the existing living conditions of the nieghbouring occupiers and therefore cuase harm to the neighbouring occupiers residential amenites.\r\rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement.

    "Application Site\rThe application site consists of a semi-detached two storey single dwellinghouse The surrounding area is predominately residential in character. The site is located within The Groves Conservation Area and within Flood Zone 1.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side and rear extension, rear dormer extension  and changes to fenestration\r\rConsultation\r\r15 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposed development. In addition, a site was displayed near the site and a press notice published in the Surrey Comet.  One  representation has been received raising no objections subject to materials matching existing and that rooflights are conservation style rooflights.\r\rMaldens and Coombe Conservation Areas Advisory Committee: The application does not have a design and access statement. However, no objection subject to conditions that all rooflights are conservation style roof lights and that materials match existing.\r\rTrees and Landscapes Officer: I have no objection to the proposals which have no impact upon trees or landscape in the Conservation Area.\r\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \rThe impact of the proposed development on heritage assets; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; \r- Fire Safety \r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side/rear extension would 'wrap around' the existing two storey rear addition and would have a maximum projection of 3m from the rear most wall of the house. The roof would be pitched, measuring 2m to the eaves at the lowest point near the boundary with No.65. Matching materials are proposed. There would be very limited visibility of the extension from the street, however, it would not appear obtrusive or detract from the character and appearance of the host building or surrounding area. \r\rThe rear dormer roof extension would be of a sympathetic design, and size that would sit comfortably within the rear roof slope. Views of it would be limited to the rear elevation, as such, owing to its design and siting, it would be a sympathetic addition to the host building. \r\rThe roof lights are acceptable in principle, however, officers agree with the representations received that they should be 'conservation style' which could be secured via conditions. \r\r\rHeritage Assets\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rAccording to Paragraph 206, local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas and within the setting of heritage assets in order to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area.\r\rDesignation summary\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A planned mid-Victorian estate of houses of various sizes and styles, the core of which forms the Spring Grove Estate, including St John's Church, a school, and local shops.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed single storey side and rear extensions, rear dormer roof extension and roof lights (subject to conditions) would not materially detract from the appearance of the building or the immediate surrounding area. It follows, therefore, that Officers conclude there would be no harm to the significance of the Groves Conservation Area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \r\rGiven the distance of the proposal to neighbouring habitable room windows at No. 61, no concerns are raised with regards to the impact on this property. \r\rWith regards to the attached dwellinghouse at No.65, the proposed single storey side/rear extension would project approximately 6.7m along the shared boundary with this property, however, the extension would have a modest height of 2m to the eaves, with roof sloping away from the rear windows of the adjoining house. As such, the extension is not considered to have a significant adverse impact on the occupiers of this dwellinghouse by way of loss of daylight/sunlight.  \r\rThere would be no adverse impacts to the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers as a result of the rear dormer or roof lights. \r\rIn summary, owing to the relationship of the proposed extensions to surrounding residential properties, they are not expected to have any adverse impacts on the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably meets the requirements of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side/rear extension\r\rThis application follows recently refused application 22/03722/HOU dated 23.01.2023 for the erection of single storey side/rear extension which was refused for the following reasons;\r\r1. By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear/side extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 20 Selwyn Road, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no. 20 Selwyn Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r2. By reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear/side extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 20 Selwyn Road, by reason of the loss of daylight and direct sunlight to the adjoining property at no. 20 Selwyn Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r3. The porch extension would not relate well to the host property and appear as an incongruous addition within the streetscene. The proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building and streetscene, contrary to the Council's Residential Design SPD, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThese reasons for refusal would need to be addressed in order for this application to be successful. \r\rIt is noted that the porch has been removed from the design so reason 3 for refusal falls away.\r\rConsultation\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and two letters of objection have been received stating;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r\rThese material considerations will be considered as part of the assessment.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that reasons 1 and 2 for refusal refer to the impact on amenity. The proposed rear extension has been reduced in depth. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension has been reduced in depth along the boundary with No. 20 Selwyn Road and No. 24 Selwyn Road and would now be compliant with BRE Guidance in relation to loss of daylight/sunlight. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy and the previous reason for refusal falls away.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Schedule 10 of the legal agreement dated 29 July 2022 states:\r\rThe Developer covenants with the Council:\r1 Not to demolish Piper Hall until the Temporary Facility Details have been submitted to and agreed by the Council.\r2 To provide the Temporary Facility in accordance with the approved Temporary Facility Details with the aim of making it available prior to the demolition of Piper Hall if this is reasonably practicable.\r3 To provide the New Facility within Phase 1 of the Development.\r4 Prior to Occupation of the New Facility to submit and obtain the approval of the Council to the Community Facility Management Plan to the Council\r5 Only to operate the New Facility in accordance with the approved Community Facility Management Plan.\r\rThis application has been submitted pursuant to obligation 1, above. The applicant proposes to utilise the existing Queen Mary Hall (QMH )which is an existing community facility located in Cambridge Gardens, north of Cambridge Road Estate. The building has not been used since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic in March 2020. It is hoped that QMH will be available for future use after the new community centre is delivered in the Cambridge Road Estate regeneration providing a long term legacy benefit to the local community.\r\rQMH occupies circa 112 sqm whereas Piper Hall occupies approximately 200 sqm, therefore the interim facility would not be a like-for-like replacement, however, officers recognise that this option would carry sustainability benefits by allowing an underutilised building, within close proximity of the CRE to not only be brought back into use but also allow refurbishment of the building to secure its longevity.  Notwithstanding, this would be a temporary state of affairs until the replacement facility is delivered and the existing facility is considered to be an adequate interim solution.",
    "Consultations: \rNeighbour notifications: No representations have been received. \r\rHistoric England: Authorise delegated determination. No views expressed on the proposal.\r\rKingston Town CAAC: Objection, regarding quality of proposed materiality/finishes. Concerns are also raised regarding lack of information regarding illumination.\r\rSite and Surroundings \rThe site comprises a three storey mid terrace building located on the west side of Market Place. \r\rThe site contains a Grade-II Listed Building and is located within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The site also falls within the Kingston Town Centre Area of Archaeological Significance and Flood Risk Zone 2.\r\rProposal \rThis listed building consent application seeks consent for the replacement of 3nos existing individual letter facia signs and 2nos existing projecting signs.\r\rIt is noted that a separate application for advertisement consent has been submitted to, and approved by, the Local Planning Authority (application reference: 23/00141/ADV). \r\rPlanning Considerations \rThe key planning considerations in this case are: \r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area (including heritage impact); and\r- The impact of the development on highway safety \r\rCharacter and Appearance / Impact upon Heritage Assets\rThe NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities. \r\rPlanning decisions should ensure that developments: will function well and add to the overall quality of the area; are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; are sympathetic to local character and history; and establish a strong sense of place. \r\rPermission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, taking into account and local design standards or style guides in plans or supplementary planning documents. Conversely, where the design of a development accords with clear expectations in plan policies, design should not be used by the decision-maker as a valid reason to object to development. \r\rAt the regional level, the London Plan requires that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. It should improve an area's visual or physical connection with natural features. In areas of poor or ill-defined character, development should build on the positive elements that can contribute to establishing an enhanced character for the future function of the area. \r\rArchitecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape. It should incorporate the highest quality materials and design, appropriate to its context. \r\rAccordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development: \r- Recognises distinctive local features and character \r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment \r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality \r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\" \r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings \rThe most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following: \r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy \r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing \r- Landscape setting and features \r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings \r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary \r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc. \r\rThe Council's Residential Design SPD provides further in-depth guidance. \rPolicy Guidance 29 (Materials and Detailing) states that: \r- Developers will be expected to demonstrate that they have considered the choice of materials and design detailing of those buildings that they consider represent the prevailing character of the streetscene or local area. \r- A preference should be given to the use of prevailing materials and details used in the surrounding local area unless it can be demonstrated that the choice of materials or use of design features in a proposal for residential development would enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene. \r- Care should be taken to ensure the replication of detailing or materials present in the street scene of local area represents an authentic synthesis of local architectural styles that compliment those of the host building or surrounding area. \r\rDevelopment proposals which include the use of materials or detailing which is out of context or is lacking in imagination or character will be discouraged. \r\rNPPF provisions: It is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 at para 195 sets out that the local planning authority should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset... They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset's conservation and any aspect of the proposal. \r\rParas 194-198 sets out the framework for decision making in planning applications relating to heritage assets and this application takes into account the relevant considerations in these paragraphs. \r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy 1.1 of the Council's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy, (Core Strategy), and policy 7C of the Council's Adopted Development Management Development Plan Document, (DPD), seek to ensure that new development conserves the significance of heritage assets. Development should be sympathetic in its materials and architectural detailing and the introduction of designs or materials which undermine the significance of heritage assets should be avoided. More broadly, policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021 collectively seek to ensure that new development is informed by and complements its surroundings. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rHistoric England's listing record sets out (No 6 - 9 Market Place): \"Chiesman's Store (formerly Hide's Store). A large modern department store, most of which is not of interest, but it contains some items of importance. In the basement, some flint walling and C17 brickwork. Inside the store, a fine mid C17 timber staircase from the Castle Hotel, which formerly occupied the site. Heavy square newels with carved, panelled sides and ball finials; strings carved with laurel leaves; heavy, moulded handrails; the space between handrails and strings filled with heavy foliage and roses, within which are some human figures. Some of the newels are initialled. [VCH]. Also incorporated into the new structure is an C18 hipped, tiled roof above a much-altered 3 storey, 4 bay range. [On the south side facing alleyway to back yard].\"\r\rThe application proposes the replacement of 3x existing individual letter facia signs and 2x existing projecting signs. The signage would be non-illuminated and comprise the retailer's name in individual vinyl lettering in uppercase letters (\"NEXT\"). The two projecting signs would have a black background with white lettering and the 3no. fascia signs would have black lettering against white timber boarding and stone background.\r\rWhile Officers note the concerns raised by the KCAAC, Officers take into consideration that the proposed signage would be very similar to that which presently exists in terms of style and materiality. It is considered that, when compared to the existing signage, the proposed signage would preserve the character and appearance of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the Grade-II listed building. \r\rHighway Safety\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree. \r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rLocal Planning Authorities are expected to have regard to its effect upon the safe use and operation of any form of traffic or transport on land (including the safety of pedestrians), on or over water, or in the air. Public safety considerations, the second arm of control over advertisements, do not arise very frequently. However, when it can be shown that signs would be confused with traffic signals or the visibility of drivers is impaired, a solid and sustainable ground for refusal of Advertisement Regulation consent is provided. \r\rOfficers consider that the non-illuminated proposals (as stated in the accompanying advert consent) would not be significantly different from the existing situation and would therefore have no adverse impact upon highways and transportation, thereby complying with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rConclusion \rThe proposed development would provide for the display of advertisements to the ground floor commercial unit at 8 -9 Charter Quay, Market Place, Kingston. The proposed signage is found to be acceptable, preserving the character and appearance of the designated Grade-II listed building, and the wider Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. \r\rThe proposals would not have any material effect on highway safety. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade-II Listed Building and Conservation Area, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. \r\r\rRecommendation \rThat listed building consent should be GRANTED.\r",
