    "Application Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal\rEnlargement of existing porch with erection of single storey flat roof front extension and conversion of garage into habitable space and changes to fenestration by replacement of garage door with window. Altering existing porch to make a front extension equal in width (3.2m) and 1.3m deep with flat roof. Conversion of garage into living space, including removing garage door and fitting uPVC window. Does not alter the size of the existing hard standing on the property.\r\rConsultation\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representation shave been received.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood engineer - No objection but recommended cycle parking details be submitted before approval. Due to the nature of this application type, Officers would secured cycle parking by condition should permission be approved.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on parking and highways; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note several properties within the terrace benefit from amended porches and garage conversions. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the loss of the existing garage which appears to be too small to accommodate a modern size car but could however be used for the storage of cycles. Due of the loss of this storage space a condition would be required should permission be granted to demonstrate appropriate storage for cycles. Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space as per the existing situation, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located on Regent Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r20/02838/CPU - Erection of side and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 4no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion granted on 12.01.2021\r13/16526/LDP - Erection of Single Storey Side Extension granted on 24.09.2013\r13/16337/LDP - Hip to Gable roof extension with Rear Dormer Extension and three front rooflights granted on 17.07.2013\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r7 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rOne representation was received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Excessive height or bulk of the buildings -overdevelopment\r- Inappropriate design/layout, the proposal would be out of character\r- Noise\rThe above concerns would be addressed within the report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would be approximately 3m deep and 2.7m increasing to 3.8m high featuring a mono pitched roof, following Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to recommended depths and heights. The proposed mass and bulk and design is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed modest size extension that is situated within a relatively specious plot is considered to be a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed extension would not be visible within the street view, therefore there will be no impact on the existing street scene. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in elevation view with regards to the nearest habitable opening at No 30 Regent Road and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property. The proposed extension would also pass this rule with regards to No 26 Regent Road. \r\rOfficers note concerns raised regarding a \"right of light\" enjoyed by the neighbouring property. However, this is a private / civil matter. \r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
