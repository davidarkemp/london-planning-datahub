    "That the applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that the condition, as noted above, is fully discharged.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Ellerton Road. The site is situated within Flood Zone 2. \r\rConsultations\r\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on drainage. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey side/rear infill extension. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider regarding amenity would be No. 31 Ellerton Road. The application site and this neighbouring property are separated by individual alleyways running along the side of each property. As such the proposed extension would be sited away from the boundary of No. 31 Ellerton Road. Due to this siting, coupled with the minimal scale of the proposed development, the proposal would not impact this neighbouring property through loss of light or through an overbearing impact. The application proposes the installation of a ground floor window and door facing this neighbouring property. As this is similar to an existing situation, and is at ground floor level, it is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on this neighbouring property through a loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
