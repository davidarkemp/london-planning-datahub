    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the first floor windows serving the rooms labelled as 'Bathroom 1' and 'Bathroom 3' on the approved drawing shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be used for purposes ancillary to the main dwelling house, and shall not be used, sold or sub-let as a separate self-contained unit.\r\rReason: A separate unit of accommodation of this nature is not acceptable in this location in the interests of the amenities, character of the area and highway safety in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans.

    "The site comprises an end-of-terrace house located on the south eastern side of Clippesby Close.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposed extension would exceed the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of depth, in this case the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would not be dissimilar to other extensions in the immediate vicinity. IN addition, it would not be clearly visible from the street. Therefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, the proposed extension would not conform with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of depth. Whilst Officers acknowledge that it would be well separated from neighbouring property, No. 4 Clippesby Road and therefore would have no unacceptable adverse impact on the occupiers' amenity, it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 6 Clippesby Close. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises terraced dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r-The impact of the proposed devleopment on highways and transportation.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse negavtive impact on neighbouring properties in terms of sunlight/daylight. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. \r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, which would comply with the standards set out in the London Plan 2021.\r\rIn terms of cycle parking it is considered that due to the loss of the garage, there would be a loss of cycle storage options therein. Although, there would be adequate space on site to address the issue. Subject to the satisfaction of a condition, the proposed development would achieve compliance with the London Plan standards.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two-storey terraced dwelling, located within the Fishponds Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for demolition of the existing rear conservatory and shed, erection of single storey rear extension and rear dormer roof extension, installation of 3nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Erection of boundary wall and gate with hardstanding in front and rear garden.\r\rConsultation\rEight neighbouring properties were notified of the proposal. Three representations were received, objecting on the following grounds:\r\rThe proposed development is not proportionate and visually dominant;\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension does not accord with the SPD setbacks from the ridge and main roof;\rExcessive scale of the rear dormer window and single storey rear extension;\rThe proposed use of zinc and aluminium as external materials do not respect, preserve or enhance the Conservation area. \r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): Object. \r\rDo not object to the rear extension however the roofing material should be more robust and longer lasting materials appropriate for use in the CA. Object to the roof lights on the front elevation due to the visual harm they will cause to the views along the streetscape, particularly within this section of Browns Road. If, however the council are minded to approve, then there should be no more than two rooflights which should be flush\rwith the roof and not project from it.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the Conservation Area;\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Heritage\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 (Two-storey Rear Extensions), and Policy Guidance 39 (Dormer Windows) of the SPD Guidance are applicable to this application.\r\rThe application site is located within the Fishponds Conservation Area.  This area is summarised as the former mid century estate of The Fishponds, with the surviving core of the original house and part of the grounds laid out as a 20th century park. In addition there is  a cohesive set of late 19th Century, 2 storey terraced artisan cottages, with small front gardens. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension is not consistent with the predominant roof form of the surrounding or conservation area and contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 less than 500mm from the ridgeline of the existing roof. Whilst the impact to the streetscene is minimal, the use of zinc cladding is considered unsympathetic and does not respect the character or appearance of the Conservation Area. The proposed number of rooflights to the front elevation is excessive given the absence of rooflights to the front elevation on neighbouring properties and the wider Conservation Area. The proposed window to the rear elevation is not encouraged however it is acknowledged this is to the rear of the property. The proposed single storey rear extension accords with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rIt is therefore considered that the harm to the significance of the conservation area would be less than substantial and would not be outweighed by any public benefit.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, and would not accord with Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting and design of the proposed extensions officers do not consider the proposed development would unduly impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of loss of privacy, daylight/sunlight, sense of dominance, enclosure and impact to outlook from the rear windows of the properties at Nos.33 and 35 Browns Road.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and on the wider conservation area. The proposal fails to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Fishponds Conservation Area.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\r",
