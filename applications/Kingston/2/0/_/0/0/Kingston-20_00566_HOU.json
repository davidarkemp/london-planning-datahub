    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows fitted in the side (south) elevation at first floor level or above shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that the Planning Condition 5 (Historic Environment Record) of planning permission 20/02383/LBC is hereby partially discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.\r\rPlease note the archaeological condition will not be fully satisfied until all works are complete, including any post-excavation assessment/analysis leading to publication.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that the Planning Condition 16 (District Heat Network Statement) of planning permission 17/16547/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r32 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side extension would not strictly comply with recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the shared boundary at first floor level, however it would have a modest footprint, would be set down prominently from the ridge of the original roof slope and would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling. As such, officers consider the proposed extension to be a proportionate and appropriate addition to the host property, that would not detract from the character or appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would adhere to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, and as such officers consider it to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, it would have a modest height and roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling, and as such would not appear out of proportion with the host property. It is considered that it would appear in keeping with the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that both neighbouring properties benefit from existing extensions, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rWhile an opening is proposed to the side elevation at first floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it reasonable to impose a condition to ensure that the window is obscure-glazed, and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposal would sever the access to the rear of the garden, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that cycle parking is provided in the event of an approval.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
