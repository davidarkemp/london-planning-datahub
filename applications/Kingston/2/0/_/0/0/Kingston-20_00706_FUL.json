Overall, it is considered that the proposed materials would be acceptable.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst officers note that the proposal would complement the original roof form of the house by having the same pitch roof design, the proposed raised roof height (by approximately 1.8m) would have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape in regards to scale. Neighbouring properties are a maximum of two-storeys in height and it is noted that the application site occupies a highly prominent position in relation to Chantry Road to the north-west and north. Officers consider that the proposed increased roof height and additional storey would appear as an inappropriate and incongruous addition to the host property and the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposal in relation to neighbouring properties, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r3x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\rPlanning History\r\r22/00694/HOU- Erection of single storey rear extension, replacement roof to existing rear extension including the addition of a rooflight and associated landscaping GRANTED 20.04.2022\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on flooding.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Following the approval of the previous application 22/00694/HOU, the applicant has set the proposal away from the shared boundary with no.112 Somerset Avenue.  The proposed ground floor extension would extend 2.615 metres to the rear of the existing dwelling, to allow its rear wall to be flush with that of the existing projection. The height of the proposed flat roof rear extension would be 3.375 metres, to match the height of the existing rear extension at no.112 Somerset Avenue. Overall, it is considered that the proposed extensions would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition and would relate well to the host dwelling. Given the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the host property, or surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: No. 108 and No. 112 Somerset Avenue are the principal properties to be considered in relation to amenity. There is an existing ground floor extension to the rear of No. 112 Somerset Avenue and due to the limited depth of the proposed rear extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of either neighbouring properties at No. 108 (given the realtionship between the properties and the existing rear projections to the application property) or No. 112 Somerset Avenue, by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that the proposed extension would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would not be required as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\rFire Safety Assessment\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Robin Hood Lane. The site is situated within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning History\r\r22/00796/HOU - Conversion of garage into habitable space and erection of single storey front porch and rear extension. Refuse on 06 May 2022. With conditions.\r\rReasons for Refusal: \r\rThe proposed ground floor rear extension, by reason of the excessive height, combined with its siting along the shared boundary, would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 73 Robin Hood Lane, constituting an unneighbourly form of development, in conflict with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window/doors at No. 73 Robin Hood Lane in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property.\rAs such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r17950 - Two storey side extension. Application Granted on 15 Feb 1977. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation was received SUPPORTING the application, however no reasoning was given. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on cycle parking. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of a single storey front extension to facilitate a porch. The proposed front porch area reflects the character of the main house, and appears as part of the original building and not as an obvious addition, which would be clearly subordinate to the original dwellinghouse. Additionally, many of the properties within the vicinity have had similar extensions and as such this porch would not be an uncharacteristic addition to the streetscene. \r\rThe application also proposes changes to the fenestration of the property to accommodate the conversion of a garage into a habitable room. These changes are deemed be appropriate and would relate well to the dwellinghouse, and would therefore have an acceptable impact on the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rFinally the application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure approximately 5 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse. This extension would have a mansard roof measuring approximately 3.5 metres in height. Whilst this proposed extension would exceed the recommended depth and height as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed single storey rear extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, and would not detract from its character, or the character of the wider area. \r\rParagraphs 198 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rOfficers Comments: The Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill SASC constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough. As Officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, it is also considered that the proposed development therefore would not result in any harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application does not propose the installation of any windows facing neighbouring properties, as such the proposal would not result in a loss of privacy.  \r\rFurthermore, as the proposed single storey rear extension is now set in from the boundary with the adjoining property at No. 73 Robin Hood Lane, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an overbearing appearance or a loss of sunlight to this neighbouring property. This application has therefore overcome the reasons for refusal of the previous application (22/00796/HOU). \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would lead to the removal of an existing garage. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site. \r\rFurthermore, it is considered that the remaining hardstanding is of an adequate size to accommodate one off-street car parking spaces. This provision would be in line with the maximum standards set out in the London Plan. The proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on highway safety and congestion.  \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would result in the loss of a garage. Officers therefore consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the application in the event of an approval for the applicant to provide details of secure onsite cycle parking. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
