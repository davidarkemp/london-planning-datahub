    "The proposal would involve the loss of the existing retail and employment uses at the site. No  robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the premises has been actively marketed, and that the existing uses or an alternative employment use is no longer viable. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policies DM17, DM19 and CS11 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling and detached garage.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the demolition of existing garage and erection of part two storey and part single storey side/rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r10 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- The impact of the development on highways.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension to the front, whilst not set back from the front elevation, incorporates a pitched roof to appear as a fully integrated extension.  Officers note that the neighbouring property at No.54 has an extension of a similar footprint and form. This type of development is also evident in a number of properties within the streetscene. With the exception of the projection towards the front elevation, the extension would be of similar depth to the existing garage, and incorporate a flat green sedum roof behind the pitched element.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would accord with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD (officers note this is a revision to refused scheme 21/02838/HOU). External materials would match the host dwelling, and the flat roof would match the proposed single storey extension to the front.\r\rThe proposed 2 storey side/rear extension would be set back sufficiently from the principal elevation with a compatible roof form to appear subordinate and proportionate to the host dwelling. External materials would also match the existing building. Whilst the SPD seeks to retain characteristic gaps between houses to prevent a terracing effect, examples of first floor side extensions are evident with the Selbourne Avenue streetscape and the proposal would therefore be in keeping with the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed single storey extensions to the side and rear are generally modest in terms of scale, depth and detailed design and are in accordance with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rWhilst Officers acknowledge that no windows are proposed to the side elevation of the two storey side/rear extension (the previously refused scheme included windows), it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that this element of the scheme would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon outlook, daylight/sunlight or create an undue sense of enclosure to the first floor side window at No.54 Selbourne Avenue. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be unacceptable.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Despite the demolition of the existing garage, this loss would not constitute a loss in off-street car parking provision on site as it woud not comply with the minimum size parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013. Officers note that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this would be in excess of the maximim standards set out in the London Plan this matter would not warrant grounds for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building, located on the north eastern side of Coombe Hill Chase, and subject to a blanket Tree Preservation Order.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and almost entirely surrounded by the Coombe House Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the partial conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of part two storey and part single storey rear, first floor side extension, including  infill link between garage and main house.\r\rThe application follows a previous scheme that was granted planning permission (20/00153/HOU) for erection of two storey side extension and single storey rear extension; partial conversion of garage into habitable accommodation and associated infill link between garage and dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. One representation was received objecting to the proposal on the following grounds:\rThe proposed extension would not be in keeping with the remaining houses in Coombe House;\rThe house will look out of place when viewed from the street;\rInsufficient parking; and,\rImpact to adjacent Conservation Area.\r\rThe above matters will be addressed later in this report.\r\rThe following matters were also raised in the objections, however, they are considered not to be material in this case and fall under other regimes and legislation:\rImpact to wildlife around the lake;\rDrainage; and,\rShareholders approval required for breach of covenant.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r-The impact of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension element of the proposal would be subordinate and proportionate to the host building, and respect the rear building line of the neighbouring property, No. 10 Coombe House Chase. \r\rHowever, the proposed two storey rear extension in combination with the proposed first floor side extension would have an excessive bulk, scale and mass and incorporate an unsympathetic roof form.\r\rAlthough setback from the principal front elevation, the proposed first floor side and two storey rear extension would be clearly visible from the street, infilling part of the area above the existing garage and enclosing a significant proportion of the existing gap between the host and neighbouring property at No.10 Coombe House Chase. The Residential Design SPD, 2013 seeks to retain characteristic gaps between houses to prevent a terracing effect. \r\rWhilst Officers acknowledge the fact that properties on Coombe House Chase remain very similar in appearance to one another, which affords a pleasing sense of uniformity in the street scene and makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the area, Officers also acknowledge that it would be wholly unreasonable to require that this uniformity be strictly maintained in principle and in perpetuity. However, in this case and in comparison to the previously approved scheme (20/00153/HOU) the proposed first floor side and two storey rear extension elements are considered to be of a poor design, an excessive bulk, scale and mass and would not only result in an incongruous and unsympathetic addition to the host dwelling but would also have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application site neither contains, nor forms part of any designated heritage assets. However, it does fall within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC), which is a non-designated heritage asset. It is also in close proximity to the boundary of the Coombe House Conservation Area, which is a designated heritage asset. \r\rThe significance of the Coombe House Conservation Area can be summarised as relating to the core of the demolished 16th Century Coombe House manorial estate, including walls, outbuildings, and landscape features from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, together with 20th century infill developments. The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill SASC relates to an area of fine houses and lodges set in a landscape of exceptional quality, which began as a series of small estates in the late 18th century.\r\rAs stated above, Officers consider that the proposal would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. It follows that Officers conclude that the proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the significance and setting of the Coombe House Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill SASC which would not be outweighed by any public benefit.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting and scale of the proposed extensions at ground floor level it is considered this part of the proposal would not have any adverse impact on the amenities of the neighbouring property at No.10.\r\rHowever, the proposed first floor side extension and two storey rear extension would encroach upon and enclose the space between the application property and No.10. In this regard it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would comply with BRE Guidance and would not result in in an unnacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook from the nearest habitable room windows of No.10 Coombe House Chase. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be unacceptable.\r\rHighways and Transport\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Despite the partial loss of the existing garage it would remain of an adequate size to accommodate a car in accordance with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. The hardstanding to the front of the property would remain unchanged and also provide off-street car parking. Whilst this level of provision would exceed the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, Officers note that this is reflective of the existing situation and and therefore would not warrant reason for refusal.\r\rA separate side access to the rear garden of the property would be retained and the garden would remain of a sufficient size to accommodate secure and covered bicycle storage in accrordance with the standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
