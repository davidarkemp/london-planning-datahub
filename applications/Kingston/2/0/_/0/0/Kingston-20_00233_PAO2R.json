    "Consultations\r31no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No responses have been received. \r\rHistoric England\rGive authorisation for Local Authority to make assessment and determine. \r\rMaldens and Coombe Conservation Area Advisory Committee: No objections.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises a private residential management training centre and is situated approximately 2km north-east of Kingston upon Thames Town Centre. The wider area is predominantly residential in character. Coombe Wood Golf Club lies immediately north of the site and to the south, on the opposite side of George Road, there are three independent day schools comprising Holy Cross Preparatory School, Rokeby School and Marymount International School. \r\rThe Four Acres Lodge and Gate piers are Grade-II Listed and the building is located within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThis application seeks listed building consent for the installation of security gates to the main entrance at Four Acres following removal of the existing wooden gates. The proposals also seeks listed building consent for minor resurfacing works. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to character and appearance and heritage. \r\rCharacter, Appearance, Heritage \rTogether the NPPF, 2021 and the London Plan, 2021 operate to secure development of a high quality and where applicable replace poor design with better design.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 require that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 201 says that where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of) the significance of a designated heritage asset, permission should be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, or all of the following apply:\r- The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;\r- No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;\r- Conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and\r- The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.\r\rParagraph 202 goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAccording to Paragraph 206, local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas and within the setting of heritage assets in order to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rKingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character\rThe significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough.\r\rCoombe Wood Conservation Area\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th-Century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposal would not affect the ability to appreciate the significance of Coombe Wood Conservation Area and that the overall effect of the proposal on the Conservation Area would be neutral i.e. the proposal would preserve the setting of the Conservation Area.\r\rHistoric England added the former lodge and gatepiers to the National List on 26 October 2001. The Listing description is as follows: \r\r\"Former lodge and gate piers, now accommodation for management training centre. Circa 1929 by George Warren in Vernacular Revival style. Originally it would have housed servants from the main house, Four Acres. Built mainly of brick in stretcher bond but with central timber-framed gable with plastered infill, hipped tiled roof and two brick chimneystacks. One storey and attics: four windows. Casements replaced to original design in late C20. Front elevation has central timber-framed gable with carved bargeboards and band above eaves level. Overhang on wooden brackets to ground floor which has two plank doors. Ground floor has two casement windows. One hipped dormer window to each side and two to rear and four casement windows to ground floor. Adjoining are a pair of circular brick gatepiers with conoid tiled tops that form an ensemble with the lodge.\"\r\rThe overall style of the main house is one of Vernacular Revival, and the gate piers tie in with this style. It is acknowledged that the original use of the lodge as servant's quarters has long since been absent, however, it retains architectural and historic interest as an early 20th Century former lodge.\r\rThe listing of the application site confirms that it serves to make a positive contribution to the significance of the Conservation Area in its origins as an early 20th-century large, detached house within landscape grounds and relationship with the streetscene and the quality of its architecture.  \r\rThe principle of entrance gates within this position is acceptable through historic justification as the gate piers suggest that there was once some form of enclosure at the entrance to the property. \r\rThe brick, conical topped gate piers are of a unique and distinguishable character therefore any additions would need to remain subservient to this element in order for it to retain its special architectural interest. The design of the gates would be unobtrusive with a low profile, therefore it is considered that they would not result in an overbearing impact upon the character or design of the piers. By moving the gates back from the gate piers, their contact with the piers would be minimal and therefore the impact upon the integrity of the gate piers would be further reduced. \r\rThe existing comprises a modern timber gate, and, so, the proposals would not result in the loss of any historic fabric. The proposed gates are to be of the same height as the existing timber gates and are proposed to be black-finished metal which are considered to be in keeping of the style and character of the building. Based on the style and appearance of the host lodge and main building, it is unlikely that the gate was historically timber, and therefore the proposed black finished, metal gates are considered to represent a more appropriate reflection of the significance of the building's entrance serving as the site's principal access. \r\rThe boundary treatments within the area are of a mixed design and materiality. The proposed gates would not appear out of character within this part of the Conservation Area. \r\rThe proposals also seek to replace the existing damaged driveway with porous asphalt. Security measures are additionally proposed in the form of security cameras and security sensor lighting to be positioned discreetly under the eaves of the lodge building. These elements of the application are considered to be minor alterations which would not have a harmful impact upon the heritage designation of the building and are acceptable. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be in keeping with the existing building on site and the immediate surrounding area, with no negative impacts identified to the historic environment through the installation of replacement gates on the Listed gatepiers, thereby complying with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r \rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the area. The proposed gates would enhance the appearance of the Grade-II Listed gate piers through their high-quality design and materiality, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the designated heritage assets as per the requirements of the NPPF 2021.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the single storey rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth (4m v.3-3.5m), given that the proposed development would have an appropriate height, officers consider it would not appear out of proportion to the original dwelling, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While officers note that the adjoining properties do not benefit from existing rear extensions, given the modest height of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Consultations\r31no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  No responses have been received. \r\rRBK Tree and Landscaping Officer: No objections, subject to amendment to the Tree Protection Plan (TPP) to include annotation to state that the excavation for the new post is lined to prevent concrete leachates making contact with root matter (assuming the new posts will be positioned in the same locations as the existing posts). If new positions, then any new excavations will require the same lining treatment and will also need to have the initial 50cm dug by hand under arboricultural supervision. \r\rOfficer Comment: Amended TPP submitted on 05.10.2021 to include the above annotation.\r\rHistoric England\rGive authorisation for Local Authority to make assessment and determine. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises a private residential management training centre and is situated approximately 2km north-east of Kingston upon Thames Town Centre. The wider area is predominantly residential in character. Coombe Wood Golf Club lies immediately north of the site and to the south and on the opposite side of George Road there are three independent day schools comprising Holy Cross Preparatory School, Rokeby School and Marymount International School. \r\rThe Four Acres Lodge and Gate piers are Grade-II Listed and the building is located within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThis application seeks planning permission for the installation of security gates to the main entrance at Four Acres following removal of the existing wooden gates. The proposals also seeks permission for minor resurfacing works. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to character and appearance, impact upon heritage assets and residential amenity.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe principle of the installation of replacement gates is acceptable subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\rCharacter and Appearance\r\rTogether the NPPF, 2021 and the London Plan, 2021 operate to secure development of a high quality and where applicable replace poor design with better design and avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 require that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment and set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration.\r\rThe principle of entrance gates within this position is acceptable through historic justification as the gate piers suggest that there was once some form of enclosure at the entrance to the property. \r\rThe brick, conical topped gate piers are of a unique and distinguishable character, therefore any additions would need to remain subservient to this element in order for it to retain its special architectural interest. The design of the gates is unobtrusive with a low profile, therefore it is considered that there would not be any overbearing impact upon the character or design of the piers. By moving the gates back from the gate piers, their contact with the piers is minimal and, therefore, the impact upon the integrity of the gate piers is further reduced. \r\rThe existing comprises a modern timber gate, and, so, the proposals would not result in the loss of any historic fabric. The proposed gates are to be of the same height as the existing timber gates and are proposed to be black-finished metal which are considered to be in keeping of the style and character of the building. Based on the style and appearance of the host lodge and main building, it is unlikely that the gate was historically timber. The proposed metal gates are considered to represent a more appropriate reflection of the significance of the building's entrance serving as the site's principal access. \r\rThe boundary treatments within the area are of a mixed design and materiality. The proposed gates would not appear out of character within this part of the Conservation Area. \r\rThe proposals also seek to replace the existing damaged driveway with porous asphalt. Security measures are additionally proposed in the form of security cameras and security sensor lighting to be positioned discreetly under the eaves of the lodge building. These elements of the application are considered to be minor alterations which would not have a harmful impact upon the heritage designation of the building and are acceptable. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be in keeping with the existing building on site and the immediate surrounding area, with no negative impacts or harm identified to the historic environment through the installation of replacement gates on the Listed gatepiers. In fact it is considered that the proposed gates would enhance the appearance of the Grade-II listed gate piers through their high-quality design and materiality. Therefore, the proposals are considered to comply with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rResidential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 and Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 seek to ensure that development secures a good standard of amenity for all existing and future users (of land and buildings).\r\rMore specifically, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 seeks to safeguard residential amenity with regards to privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rHowever, it is considered that there would be no significant adverse amenity impact caused to neighbouring properties above and beyond the existing situation.  \r\rAs such, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the area and would not have any significant adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity. The proposed gates would enhance the appearance of the Grade-II Listed gate piers through their high-quality design and materiality. As such, the proposals are considered to comply with the NPPF, 2021, the London Plan, 2021, and the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The application site is located on the east side of South Lane just to the north of the crossroads of Groveland Way and Selwyn Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The site is not in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\r88 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposed telecoms apparatus. 4 representations is support have been received.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of 5G telecoms of H3G Phase 8 18m high street pole c/w wrap-around cabinet and 3 further additional equipment cabinets.\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location  on South Lane opposite and adjacent to a number of residential properties.\r\rThe height of the mast would be 20m which would be in excess of 8 to 10m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits. \r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.",

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development, taking into account the permitted neighbouring extension and after applying the 45 degree guidance, would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
