    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on The Manor Drive. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey extension at the front of the property to accommodate an extended garage and porch. Whilst this would not meet the recommendations and requirements of the Residential Design SPD 2013, it would not be uncharacteristic of the area. The application also proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension with alterations to the roof at the side of the property that would connect to the proposed extensions at the front. However, this would not result in an increse in built form to the side of the property and in closest proximity to neighbouring property, No. 87 Manor Drive North. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Officers do note the installation of an additional window at ground floor level on the side elevation facing No. 87 The Manor Drive and in relation to a downstairs bathroom. In the interest of the amenity of this neighbouring property, and occupiers of the application site, officers consider it appropriate to attach a condition to ensure that this windows is obscure glazed in the event of an approval.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comments: The application proposes the extension to an existing garage to the front. The proposed garage would not meet the recommended internal dimensions for a garage as outlined by the Sustainable Travel SPD 2013, as this garage would be partly used as a utility room. Whilst this garage would not sufficiently support a space for vehicle parking, it would be sufficient for cycle parking. Despite the loss of the existing garage space, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least two off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue would not warrant a reason for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
