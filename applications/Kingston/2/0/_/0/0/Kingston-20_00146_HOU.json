    "The proposed erection of side dormer, partial hip to gable roof extension to front, hip to gable extension to rear would result in an incongruous and jarring appearance from the street due to their design and bulk. These elements would not be proportionate or subordinate and would not relate well to the main dwelling or No. 24 Park Road, thereby conflicting with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document, 2013.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal is for the demolition of existing conservatory and bathroom and erection of part single, two storey rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r4 neighbouring properties were consulted. No comments were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would have a total depth of approximately 8.7m, with the two storey element having a depth of approximately 5.4m and the single storey element having a depth of approximately 3.3m. The maximum height of the two storey extension would be approximately 5.4m with an eaves height of approximately 4.5m. The single storey extension would have a flat roof with an eaves height of approximately 3.0m.\r\rThe two storey element would appear similar to an existing extension at no.84 Cleaveland Road which is the adjoining semi detached pair to the application property. The pitched roof of the two storey element would be in keeping with the pitched roof design of the application property and the single storey element would appear suitably subordinate to the application property. \r\rThe rear extension would step out from the side elevation of the main dwellinghouse by approximately 0.4m to the line of the existing conservatory. The appearance of this is somewhat awkward in relation to the main dwellinghouse and it would be preferable for the extension to be brought back in line with the original building line. However, as the extension will only be visible when looking directly down the side passage from the street owing to its location at the rear of the property, and will not be prominently visible in the street scene, it is not considered that this would cause such material harm to the character and appearance of the application property that it should be refused on these grounds. \r\rThus, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: No.82 Cleaveland Road has a large two story elevation wall and a single storey rear addition, with no windows, running along the boundary with the application property which extends to a similar depth as the proposed two storey rear element. The proposed single storey rear element would have a depth of 3.3m and a height of 3.0m which would be in accordance with the guidance in the Residential Design Guide guidance for single storey rear extensions. This is the depth of the extension which would be experienced on the boundary by number 84. \r\rThe depth of the extension experienced by number 82 would be approximately 1.4m and the extension is also set back from the boundary by 1.0m. A side elevation window is proposed at first floor level and this will need to be conditioned to be obscured glazed and non-opening below 1.7m. Thus, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
