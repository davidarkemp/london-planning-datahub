    "By virtue of its siting, scale and size, the proposed dwelling would be a substantial built form which would erode the gap between the application site and number 73 Hemsby Road, Chessington. The proposal would result in a terracing effect, which would have a harmful impact to the street scene and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 24 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the new crossover would  not prejudice highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Officer's Report - \rThe site is located within primary shopping frontage on the northern side of Clarence Street and on the junction of Fife Road, within Kingston's designated Metropolitan Town Centre. The buildings on site are not listed, or locally listed and the site does not fall within a conservation area. However, the site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). It also falls within an Area of Archaeological Significance and Key Views (not designated heritage assets).\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r-The impact of the development on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the proposed development on Flood Risk; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of siting, scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As stated above the site falls within an Area of Archaeological Significance and Key Views. These are non-designated heritage assets.  As also stated above the proposed development is considered not to result in any harm to the character and appearance of the premises or the immediate surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to non-desigated heritage assets.\r\rParagraph 166 of the NPPF 2021 states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment. This includes all development within Flood Zones 2 and 3.\r\rDevelopment should only be allowed in areas at risk of flooding where, in light of this assessment, it can be demonstrated that:\r\r-Within the site, the most vulnerable development is located in areas of lowest flood risk, unless there are overriding reasons to prefer a different location.\r-The development is appropriately flood resistant and resilient.\rIt incorporates sustainable drainage systems, unless there is clear evidence that this would be inappropriate.\r-Any residual risk can be safely managed.\r-Safe access and escape routes are included where appropriate, as part of an agreed emergency plan.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 echo national policy in these regards.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the nature and siting of the proposed development, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon flood risk as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Officers note that the Council's Environmental Health Team has raised not objection to the proposals subject to conditions regarding noise and the submission of details regarding the proposed extraction system.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021 and the Policies of the Core Strategy (2012).",
