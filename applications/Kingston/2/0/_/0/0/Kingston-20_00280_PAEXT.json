    "This application seeks a non-material amendment to planning permission ref. 17/14632/FUL. The applicant wishes to make some internal changes to the floor layout of the permitted residential units but would not change the quantum or mix of units. In addition some changes to the approved fenestartion and balconies are proposed. \r\rOfficers consider the proposed arrangement to be accceptable and a non material amendment and as such, it is recommended that the application be granted.\r\rIt is noted that one objection has been received. The objection is summarised as follows. \r\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal does not result in a material change to the extant permission 17/14632/FUL. The proposed changes would not change the quantum of units or their mix and would not alter the extant relationship with the neighbouring properties with regards the height and bulk, provision of daylight/sunlight or privacy and would not increase demand for parking.",
