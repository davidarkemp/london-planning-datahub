    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The car parking spaces shown on the approved drawing shall be provided with a hard, bound, dust-free surface, adequately drained before the development is occupied for the purpose hereby permitted. The respective areas shall be kept free from obstruction at all times, and shall not thereafter be used for any other purposes other than those shown on the approved drawing.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking accommodation and to avoid the congestion of surrounding roads by parked vehicles in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Schedule 2, Part 3 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) the proposed development hereby permitted shall solely be used for the parking of motor cars and for no other vehicles. \r\rReason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control of the use of the development in order to safeguard the amenities of the area in accordance with Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions).   \r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, it would have a modest height and roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling, as such there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original building or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development, and that neighbouring properties benefit from existing rear extensions, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would reduce the width of the existing driveway, limiting access to the detached garage to the rear of the dwelling, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would not be wide enough to comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision. As such, the proposed development would not result in any loss or gain of off-street parking on site. In any case, the existing garage would be able to accommodate cycle parking, in line with the policy requirements of the London Plan.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would be a modest addition to the host property and would appear in keeping with host property. As such, officers consider that the proposed extension would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is advised to resubmit with a reduced side extension, this should be set in from the boundary of the site and its ridge height reduced. The rear dormer should be reduced in size, the site occupies a prominent and exposed position, an a redesign to a design more in keeping with the host property would minimise its impact.",
    "Preparation and sale of hot food for purposes of hot food takeaway\r\rThe applicant should be aware that this permission does not allow for the preparation and sale of hot food for hot food take away and consumption of the premises. A planning application would be required for the premises to be used in such a way.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached end of terrace dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing conservatory and erection of single-storey front, side and rear extensions. First floor side extension Rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r5 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rUpon first assessment officers noted that the proposed side extension would not be compliant with Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 as the proposed side extension roof line would not be set down from that of the original roof by a minimum of 500mm.\r\rAfter discussions with the applicant revised plans were submitted on 04.11.2021 to ensure the development would be in general compliance with this guidance.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the  Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that similar extensions have previously been permitted along Keswick Avenue. The proposed roof form in this case would not unbalance the terrace of three houses (an imbalance already exists). Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Officer Comment:  The principal properties for consideration are No. 13 and No. 17 Keswick Avenue. Due to the existing situation in relation to both properties (both extensions and boundary treatments), it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a ground floor flat within a detached property.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side/rear wraparound extension would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013, in terms of separation from the shared boundary, or depth, however, it would have a modest height, with a proposed roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling. In terms of materials the use of timber cladding is considered not to be in keeping with the original building, although Officers acknowledge it is already in use on the existing single storey extension, and given that the proposed extension would be set back from the front elevation, it is considered that it would not be clearly visible and would not appear as an incongruous addition within the streetscene.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a modest eaves height, due to its excessive depth and proximity to the shared boundary with No 108 Gloucester Road, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring amenity in terms of overbearing and an undue sense of enclosure to the nearest ground floor habitable room window. Due to the absence of windows in the south west flank elevation there would be no unaccpetable adverse impact in terms of overlooking or loss of privacy.  With regard to No. 102 Gloucester Road it is considered that there would not be any unacceptable adverse impact due to the siting of the proposed extension.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
