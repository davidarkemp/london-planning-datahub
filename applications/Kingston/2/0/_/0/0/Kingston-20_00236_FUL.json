    "The proposal would involve the loss of an existing office in a location within Kingston Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. No  robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the property has been actively marketed. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policy DM17 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By virtue of the lack of private external amenity space, the proposed development would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation for future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013). \r",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority that the proposal could provide on-site bicycle parking provision in accordance with Policy 6.9 of the London Plan (2016) and the Council's Sustainable Transport Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached single dwelling.\r\rProposal\r\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of the existing single storey rear extension and a replacement extension at a depth of 5.5m. The extension would have a height of 3.9m with a flat roof. \r\rConsultation\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been consulted and no responses have been received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal is considered not to result in an adverse impact on the living conditions of the occupiers of No. 39 Buxton Drive, however, with respect to No. 35 Buxton there is some concern. This property has not been extended and the proposed extension would project 5.5m from the rear building line at a height of 3.9m, hard up against the shared boundary, which would have the effect of being overbearing and unneighbourly. The proposal would fail the '45 degree rule' as discussed in Policy Guidance 17 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013, both in plan and elevation form.  Furthermore, the extension is located to the west of No. 35 which would result in some increased overshadowing to the amenity space for most of the day. It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of daylight and sunlight and increased overshadowing. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 6 objections, 1 neutral representation and 1 comment in support of the application from 3 separate households have been received relating to:\r\r-Inappropriate design/layout\r-Car park issues\r-Effect on trees \r-Noise\r-Privacy\r-Storage of hazardous substances\r-Unacceptable or incompatible use\r-Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r\rOfficers note that concerns relating to boundaries and property rights are a civil matter and are not material planning considerations which can be assessed as part of this application. Officers also note that the proposal is for residential use, which would be acceptable given that the dwelling is situated in a residential area. Concerns relating to sewage and water treatment as well as asbestos removal are subject to a further approval through the relevant bodies. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposal would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD as the two storey side extension would be built up to the shared boundary, and would not be set down from the ridge line of the original roof, resulting in a bulky and incongruent addition to the host property. Given that there are no similar extensions in the immediate vicinity it would result in the deterioration of the characteristic gaps between properties and would appear a dominant feature within the streetscene.\r\rOfficers note that the first floor rear extension would also not be separated from the shared boundary with No. 8 Lawrence Avenue, and while the proposed elevation plan shows an inconsistent height, it would not be set down from the ridge of the original roof. Further, given that the proposed single storey rear extension would also have a height and depth that would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers consider that together the proposed rear extensions would appear dominant features on the host property that would not be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of development within the area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would largely not adhered to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given the separation distance between the proposed development and habitable windows of the neighbouring properties, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevations at first floor level, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposal would include the demolition of the existing detached garage. However, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not comply with the guidelines of the Sustainable Transport SPD, and therefore not be able to safely provide car parking, offices consider that there would be no change to the existing provision of parking on site. Further, the hardstanding to the front would be able to accommodate 1 car parking space, which would comply with the policy requirements of the London Plan.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, particularly due to the loss of the side access to the rear of the property, officers consider that further details could be ensured via condition to ensure compliance if planning permission were to be approved.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection and 1 neutral representation have been received relating to loss of light/sunlight and enhancing biodiversity with the potential to increase swift habitat enhancement.\r\rWhile officers note the importance of incorporating biodiversity enhancement measurements in planning developments, given that this would be a small-scale householder development, officers consider that it would be unreasonable to apply a condition requiring the applicant to incorporate swift habitat enhancement measures into the proposed development, however an informative has been imposed and the applicant is encouraged to follow the guidance. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed two storey side extension would not strictly adhere to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set back at ground level, the proposal would be set in adequately from the shared boundary, would be set down from the ridge line of the original roofslope, and would be adequately set back from the front elevation at first floor level. As such, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear a proportionate and appropriate addition to the host property, that would not detract from the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the eaves and ridge, however it would be set in from the sides of the roof slope and as such would appear a subordinate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the sitting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, and that the windows to the side elevation are proposed to be obscure glazed, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would include the construction of a vehicular crossover, and given that it would conform to the requirements set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would be in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy. The applicant is also advised that the applicant would be required to seek the approval of the Local Highway Authority with regards to the extension of the dropped kerb (as well as obtaining planning permission) in this case.\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
