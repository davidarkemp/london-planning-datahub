    "By virtue of its size, depth and design, the proposed single storey rear extension would fail to appear as a subservient addition. The proposal would therefore harm the character of the host dwelling, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of neighbouring property No. 65 Cambridge Road as it would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of daylight to a principal window, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that the Planning Condition 5 (Construction Management Plan) of planning permission 19/03167/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved. \r\rThe applicant should arrange with Highways for the existing crossover access to be strengthened so as to accommodate the increased weight of construction vehicles.

    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that the Planning Condition 33 (Air Quality Assessment) of planning permission 19/03167/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved. \r",
