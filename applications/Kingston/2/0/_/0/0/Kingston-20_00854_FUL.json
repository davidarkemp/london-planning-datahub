Approved on 17 January 2020. \r\rApplication reference 21/01893/FUL - Extensions and alterations to roof level including removal of chimney stacks and installation of 9no.x roof lights to facilitate loft conversion to create 1no.x self-contained 2-bedroomed flat. Refused planning permission, dated 30 September 2020. This application was refused for four reasons, as follows:\r(1)\tThe proposed residential unit would offer poor outlook for the future occupants and would not be conducive to a good standard of living accommodation, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS8 and DM13 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012.\r(2)\tThe proposed residential unit is not provided with any external amenity space for the proposed residential unit, which is contrary to Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r(3)\tIn the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets. As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy 2012.\r(4)\tThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed flatted accommodation would meet the internal space standards set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents with particular regard to floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the western side of Glenthorne Road, on the corner with Alfred Road.  It comprises of a large, prominent building that was historically built and used as a public house.  The immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and typified by rows of terraced and semi-detached family dwellinghouses.\r\rThe buildings on the site are not listed or locally listed, neither are there any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on the site or in the immediate vicinity.  However, the site does fall within Flood Risk Zone 2 (Moderate Probability), a Council designated Critical Drainage Area and the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character (LASC).  \r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for extensions and alterations to the roof level including the removal of chimney stacks and installation of 9no. roof lights in order to facilitate loft conversion to create 1no.x self-contained 2-bedroom flat.\r\rAssessment\rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the current NPPF and Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rPrinciple of Development:\rThe proposed development seeks to intensify the provision of residential units on the site that is located on existing residential land in a residential area. It is considered that the proposed development would be compatible with and would not change the existing primary residential use of the site. It is considered that subject to the detailed consideration of all other matters the principle of the development would be acceptable.  \r\rPolicy CS10 (Housing Delivery) of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that the Council will take every opportunity to deliver new housing. \r\rParagraph 60 of the NPPF 2021 states [inter alia] that to significantly boost the supply of homes, it is important that a sufficient amount and variety of land can come forward where it is needed and that land with permission is developed without unnecessary delay. \r\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rThis application proposes 1no. net additional residential unit, thereby helping to contribute to these annual housing targets. In addition, the Council are currently unable to demonstrate a 5 year supply of land for the delivery of housing. As such, the 'titled balance' and Paragraph 11(d) of the NPPF 2021 is a material planning consideration. The final section of this report considers the planning balance of the application proposals. \r\rQuality of Proposed Accommodation\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan 2021 sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021.                                           \rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the Borough's Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe proposed accommodation is considered to be of a practical layout, with a total of 9no. rooflights providing daylight/sunlight to the accommodation. The rooflights would be the only form of fenestration. In the assessment of the previous submission, Officers had concerns regarding the resulting limitation to the outlook for future occupiers of the proposed unit. The application proposals now show double conservation-type rooflights to the habitable rooms, extending the amount of glazing and therefore allowing for greater outlook (as demonstrated in proposed section B-B). Officers consider that the internal accommodation is now afforded improved degree of outlook from that as previously proposed, representing a good standard of accommodation in this regard. \r\rThe application seeks to provide a two bedroom, four-person unit laid over a single floor, for which Policy D6 of the London Plan would require a Gross Internal Area (GIA) of 70sqm. The proposed internal floor space for the unit would amount to 86sqm providing floor space in excess of the minimum space standards. In terms of quantum of the floor area, this would be acceptable. Sections have been provided to show that the maximum floor to ceiling height would be 2.6m and demonstrates that the proposal would be in line with the lower requirement of 2.3m for at least 75% of the floor area set out in the Government's technical housing standards. The 2.3m referenced above would conflict with the requirements of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) which requires a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m for at least 75 percent of the GIA of each dwelling. However, the fact that the proposed development is a conversion and would meet the Nationally Described Space Standards, the identified conflict with the London Plan (2021) would be partially tempered.\r\rThe proposals do not include any external amenity space for the proposed residential unit, which is contrary to policy guidance within the Residential Design Guide and Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and officers note that this would be unchanged from the previously refused scheme. Officers acknowledge the inherent constraints of the site and resultant limitations around the ability to add amenity space. Similarly, Officers recognise that the scheme would propose one of a total maximum occupation of two persons and also note the proximity of Althestan Recreation Ground approximately 145m distance from the site, which could provide additional recreation opportunities. \r\rOn balance, Officers consider taking into account the inherent constraints of the building/site and the proximity of recreation space within close proximity of the application site that the absence of private amenity space would in this instance not result in a poor-quality residential environment or negatively harm the amenity of future occupiers to such an extent to warrant refusal on this ground. The second reason for refusal of application ref: 21/01893/FUL has not been addressed in that no private amenity space has been provided, however, for the reasons set out above the lack of private amenity space would only carry moderate weight against the scheme.\r\rFire Safety\rA Fire Strategy has been submitted with this application to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety, in accordance with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rThe proposals would involve the removal of 2no. chimney stacks and the addition of 9no. conservation-type rooflights (that is, 4no. to the north roof slope, 4no. to the southern roof slope and 1no. to the eastern roof slope). \r\rIt is considered that the proposed additions at roof level to the host property would generally be subordinate additions and of a style sympathetic to the host property and the surrounding area. Whilst the loss of the two chimneys would be regrettable, this proposed change would not unduly or harmfully detract from the character and appearance of the area to a significant extent. \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy 2012 seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, daylight /sunlight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. The immediate neighbouring properties include No.414 and No. 418 Kingston Road.\r\rIt is considered that the built form would be proportionate to its plot size, respect neighbouring building lines, height and massing and be in keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding areas. The proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision or privacy of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road networks would be severe.\r\rThe application site is located within an area that has poor access to public transport (PTAL score of 1b). The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (Zone G) in operation between Mon-Fri (excl. bank holidays) 8.30am - 6.30pm. \r\rIn terms of the application proposals, the London Plan Table 10.3 maximum car parking standards states up to 0.75 car parking spaces should be provided for a 2 bedroom unit. There is no additional car parking proposed, which would remain unchanged at 3no. spaces.\r\rGiven that the application site is located within a controlled parking zone and would be policy compliant in terms of off-street car parking to be within maximum parking standards, it is considered that the proposed car-free development could be acceptable. However, this is subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement to prohibit the future owners/occupiers of the proposed flat from obtaining on-street resident parking permits. \r\rThe applicant has agreed to enter into, and signed a, legal agreement to prevent occupiers of, or visitors to, the proposed development from obtaining residents parking or visitors parking permits to mitigate any parking pressures, the proposed development would comply with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe London Plan 2021 Table 10.2 requires 2no. cycle spaces per 2+ bedroom unit. \r\rThere are 7no. cycle spaces serving the property as existing. Council's traffic engineer has reviewed and accepts the proposals, provided that 2no. cycle spaces are added to the rear courtyard area and allocated for the use of the proposed unit's future occupiers. A condition requiring the necessary cycle provision to be in place prior to beneficial occupation of the unit has been attached to this permission.\r\rRefuse & Recycling\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 require integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rRefuse and recycling bin storage has not been shown on the submitted plans. Notwithstanding, Officers note the conversion of the lower floors to residential use and the land within the curtilage of the application property is considered to be of a size to allow for adequate provision. Officers attach a condition requiring details of the capacity and design/materiality of the bin store to be submitted to the local planning authority for approval prior to beneficial occupation of the unit, to ensure satisfactory waste storage and ensure the enclosure is appropriate to the street context in visual appearance terms. \r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 2 with a charge of £130 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rSummary/Planning Balance\rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5 year housing supply. \r\rThe proposed development would provide 1no. net additional market housing unit. Although the proposal would make a positive contribution towards the Borough's housing supply, only one two-bedroom flat would be provided. As such, the proposal's positive contribution to the Borough's housing stock and the associated social benefits it would bring to the community would be somewhat limited. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe proposal would not have an adverse impact on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The size, scale and design of the proposed external alterations would, on the whole, respect the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. This is given neutral weighting in the assessment of the proposals.\r\rThe living accommodation would offer satisfactory outlook for the future occupants, representing a good standard of living accommodation in terms of floor area and ceiling height. This is given significant weighting in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe proposals do not include any private amenity space for the proposed unit. However, Officers are satisfied that given the inherent constraints of the site, the level of occupation resulting from the proposed unit and the proximity to public recreation space, that this would be acceptable and not result in poor quality accommodation. In this instance, Officers assign moderate weight against the scheme in this matter.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a signed legal agreement to prevent the issue of on-street car parking permits and the proposal would not exacerbate pressure for on-street parking and prejudice highway safety. This is afforded moderate weighting in favour of the proposals as it would encourage residents to use more sustainable methods of travel.\r\rThe proposed development has been found to be in conflict with the development plan on one matter relating to private amenity space, however, it is considered that the benefits of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits of the provision of one 2-bedroom flat in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rAccordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted for the development.\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Stable Close. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension, which partly extends into the side. The proposed would measure approximately 3.5 metres in depth, and would have a pitched roof which would measure approximately 3.4 metres in height at its highest point. More than 50% of the rear garden space of the property would be retained as part of the proposal. The proposed single storey rear extension would therefore meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD. Officers do note that whilst the bare faced front elevation of the proposed side extension would not be ideal, it would not have a significantly detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area, due to its siting and minimal scale. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to the separation gaps between the proposed roof extension and neighbouring properties. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/03871/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the siting and design of the proposed piggyback roof extension. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in an incongruous development that would have appeared visually dominant within the streetscene. The proposed roof extension has now been set back by 4m, and would have a height of 1.3m. There would also be no more than 1.9m separation distance between the roof extension and the side elevations of neighbouring properties. The proposal would now accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, thereby addressing the previous reasons for refusal.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. While openings are proposed to the side elevations at roof level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition in the event of an approval, to ensure that the openings are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels. \r\rThe appeal highlighted in the submitted representations is noted, however, this dates from before the adoption of the Core Strategy and the Residential Design SPD. Moreover, there are material differences between the properties in terms of the plots on which they sit. As such, whilst material, carries limited weight. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Sufficient evidence showing that the development has achieved at least a 19% improvement in CO2 emissions versus Part L of the Building Regulations and internal water usage rates of no greater than 105L per person per day has been submitted.\r\rSubject to the development being occupied in accordance with the calculations the condition is hereby discharged \r\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments to planning permission reference: 16/10482/FUL:\r- Alterations to the design of the bus shelters and signage to comply with TfL standards\r\rThe proposed change results in a replacement TfL 'standardised' bus shelter and facility. The replacement shelter will not include any advertisement space in order to ensure that the shelter is not visually cluttered. The proposed design includes the introduction of 4no. cycle stands to provide cycle parking for those who wish to cycle to use the bus stop. The introduction of tree grilles to protect the trees around the bus shelter is also proposed. The landscaping and hardstanding surrounding the shelter will correspond with the Phase 1 landscape approach as approved. The proposed change has transpired from a TfL review and reassessment of the original design against the bus service and routing proposed, with it identified by TfL that the bus shelter as approved is too large when considered against the number of bus movements the route will accommodate. This has been assessed against current movements and anticipated future movements. These movements include anticipated additional service capacity associated with the anticipated Tolworth Station Masterplan proposals and other surrounding developments.\r\rThe proposed alterations are recognised by Officers as arising from detailed design with TfL. The proposed changes to the built scheme from that approved would not result in unacceptable harm upon the character and appearance of the area and the development's external appearance would not be significantly dissimilar to that approved. The further details are considered to be acceptable and appropriate. Overall, the proposals are not considered to have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the development or the surrounding area. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendment is considered to be non-material and it is recommended that the application be granted.\r",
    "Officer Advice\r\rThe applicant is advised to resubmit with an extension that is wholly perpendicular to the host property instead of following the boundary lines. \r\rThis is likely to address concerns of loss of light and the overbearing impact.\r\rThis is Officer Level advice and is not binding on the authority in any submission of any future planning application",
