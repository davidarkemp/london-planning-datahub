    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion and alterations to ground floor side fenestration fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A and B of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of a new porch, single storey side and rear extension and first floor side extension with associated changes to fenestration. Rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r8x surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. One representation has been received in support of the application and highlighting the following concerns:-\r\r\"In terms of privacy and noise, there needs to be soundproofing at the level of the second floor, especially, as the wall is less dense there than throughout the rest of the building. In terms of access, parking and noise, the construction team should be respectful that this is a residential neighbourhood and show courtesy to neighbours, many of whom are working from home\".\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension and rear dormer elements are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would have no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rThe proposed first floor side extension would not be set back from the front elevation, it would propose a roof form that is consistent with the existing roof slope. However, the first floor side extension would only be set in from the shared boundary by 0.69 metres, which would not conform to the relevant guideline of one metre within the Residential Design SPD. Given that the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in Lancaster Gardens are largely retained at first floor level. Particular reference is made to the visual relationship between planning permission 18/12903/HOU, granted recently at no.26 Lancaster Gardens and planning permission 18/12075/HOU, granted recently at no. 24 Lancaster Gardens. The proposed development would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling by eroding gaps between neighbouring properties and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene and surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor extension would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD as mentioned above, given the separation from the proposed development and flank wall of the neighbouring property, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevation, it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rGiven the height and depth of the proposed single storey rear extension and there being existing ground floor extensions to the rear of both neighouring properties, each side, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy to an unacceptable degree.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would convert the existing garage into habitable space. Officers note that the existing garage would not conform to modern day internal standards as set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, and as such officers consider that the proposed development would not result in the loss of on-site car parking provision.\r\rThe hardstanding to the front of the property would continue to accommodate 1 off-street car parking space which would accord with London Plan standards.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking and while it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated due to the loss of the garage space and the storage space provided therein, officers consider that the provision of cycle parking could be secured via condition in the event of an approval.\r\rGiven the above and subject to the satisfaction of a cycle parking condition the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r \rIn conclusion, by reason of its proximity to the shared boundary with No.27 Lancaster Gardens, the proposed first floor side extension would appear as a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, erode the characteristic gaps between the semi-detached properties in Lancaster Gardens and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
