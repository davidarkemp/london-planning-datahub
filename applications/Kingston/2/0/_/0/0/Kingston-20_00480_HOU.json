    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Prior to the commencement of any development above ground level, a sample of the facing materials to be utilised in the development to which this permission relates shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The development shall then be carried out in strict accordance with the approved samples.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), the outbuilding to which this permission relates shall only be used for purposes incidental to the enjoyment of 21 Malvern Road as a single family dwellinghouse and for no other purposes whatsoever (including any other purposes falling within Class C of the Schedule to the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (or any provision equivalent to that class in any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification)).\r\rReason: The acceptability of the development is highly dependent upon the exact nature of the use of the site and other uses, whether within the same use class or permitted by the General Permitted Development Order, are unlikely to be acceptable in planning terms.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the north or south elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the north or south elevations of the outbuilding to which this permission relates unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Condition 12 (District Heating) - Officers have reviewed the information submitted and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that  Condition 12 (District Heating) of planning permission 20/02213/CREG3 is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Site\rThe application site is a detached bungalow located on Ellingham Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development.\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey side and rear extension. Officers note that the proposed extension would not be set lower than the ridgeline of the original dwellinghouse, and the rear extension woud extend 5 metres in depth, which is more than the 3-3.5m recommendation set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013. Whilst these recommendations have not been met, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rPlease show the position of external machines to be installed in the proposed block plan.",
    "The submitted existing and proposed plans, elevations of Detail1,2,3 do not have a scale bar.",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rThe submitted elevations do not have a scale bar and do not show the complete building."
