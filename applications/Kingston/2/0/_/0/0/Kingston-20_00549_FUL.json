    "By virtue of their colour, texture, and appearance,  the replacement roof tiles are unsympathetic and out of keeping with the original characteristics of the host property. As a consequence, the development fails to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The site comprises a large detached building to the north of Southborough Road, Surbiton. It is understood that the building comprises 2 self-contained flats.\r\rThe site is within the Southborough Conservation Area. \r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and no representations were received.\r\rPlanning History\r20/00313/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension, partial removal and alterations to roof of existing garage (following demolition of existing rear extension). Granted 09.04.2020.\r21/01840/HOU - Erection of single storey side/rear extension and side dormer roof extension. Granted - 30.07.2021.\r5848/S - Conversion of house into 3 self-contained flats. Granted 21.10.1963.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign and impact on heritage assets \rImpact on neighbour amenity\r\rDesign and impact on heritage assets \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficers Comment: \rThe proposed rear / side extension extends approximately 4.9m from the main rear elevation (but only approximately 1.4m beyond the existing rear extension which is being demolished) and approximately 1.2m to the side of the host property, extending to a height of 3.7m (parapet height of 4.3m). The extension extends beyond the guidance set out in Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD, which requires rear extensions to generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth and 3m in height. However, in this case, the proposed extension extends only 1.4m beyond the existing extension, proportionate to this substantial building and is set down from the first floor windows. It is also considered high quality in design and a significant improvement on the existing extension.\r\rThe proposed garage, in place of the existing, is considered to be of a far high quality of design and more in keeping with the architectural detail of the host building. This will make a positive contribution to the Conservation Area given its prominence. \rMinor alterations to fenestration are proposed to the side and rear at the ground floor level. These are considered modest changes which are not detrimental to the host building or character and appearance of the Conservation Area. \rAn outbuilding is proposed which is modest in scale, set away from the boundaries and appropriate in design and materials with regard to its historic context. \r\rIn summary, the proposed side and rear extension, garage, outbuilding and fenestration changes to the building are considered acceptable by reason of their design, siting scale, height and materials and would make an overall positive contribution towards the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area. It is therefore in accordance with Paragraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: The proposed side/rear extension extends further towards the side of the neighbouring property and is significant in height. It also has flank windows. However, it is set well in from the boundary (approximately 1m) and extends only marginally beyond the neighbouring extension to No. 13 Southborough Road. It is also noted that there is a substantial hedge /planting on this boundary. It is therefore not considered overbearing or likely to result in undue loss of privacy, daylight or sunlight to this neighbour. It is also not considered to affect the amenity of occupiers of the upper floor flats either given its siting. \rThe proposed garage is smaller in footprint but extends to a greater height with a pitched roof. There is a window on the flank of the neighbouring No. 13 Southborough Road but, given the design and as any outlook would already be significantly curtailed by the main building, this is not likely to be overbearing for this neighbour (even if it is a habitable room).\r\rThe other changes to fenestration are modest, at the ground floor level and will not affect the amenity of neighbours.\r\rIn summary, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions. The proposal is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r",
