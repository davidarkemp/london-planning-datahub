    "That the applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that the conditions, as noted above, are fully discharged.",
    "The site comprises a semi detached dwellinghouse.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The loss of the garage.\r\r7x neighbouring properties were sent letters of consultation and no representations have been received by the Council.\r\rThe host property has no recent planning history. However, two extant planning permissions have been granted recently at the neighbouring property at no.10 Northcote Avenue:-\r21/00059/HOU- Granted in March 2021 for the demolition of an existing conservatory, leant to, garage and porch and the erection of a two storey side extension and single storey front and rear extensions;\r21/02195/HOU- Granted in September 2021, for the erection of a two storey side extension, single storey rear extension and front porch extension (following demolition of the existing side, rear and front porch extension).\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Both of the schemes granted planning permission earlier in 2021 at no.10 would incorporate hipped roofs above a two storey side extension. The ridge of the roof above the proposed two storey side extension at no.12, would be dropped slightly in relation to the ridge of the original dwellinghouse and would be hipped. The front wall of the proposed two storey side extension at no.12, would be stepped in and this extension would adjoin the parapet party wall shared with no.10. The proposed development at no.12, is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rOfficer Comment: There is an existing ground floor extension to the rear of no.14 Northcote Avenue rear extensions proposed with both planning permissions granted at no.10 Northcote Avenue in 2021. It is considered therefore, that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS6 and DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 seek to secure future cycle parking in order to promote sustainable travel/transport modes.\rOfficer Comment: The proposal involves the loss of an existing garage, which would be converted to a store. This proposed store, could provide a secure and covered area for cycle parking. The deposited plans do not show any provision for future secure and covered cycle parking and as such a condition is recommended to secure future cycle parking in order to promote sustainable travel/transport modes.\r\rOther matters: The proposal relates to teh extension of an exitsing residential dwellinghouse in Flood zone2/3. It is not considered that the proposal would exacerbate/contribute to existing flood risk in the area.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r",
