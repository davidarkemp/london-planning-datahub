    "Description\rErection of a single storey rear extension to ground floor maisonette (No. 17) and new decking, fence and side gate.\r\rConsultations\r5no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\rNone.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the north-eastern side of Vale Crescent and comprises of a 2-storey semi-detached dwelling which has been divided into 2no. flats. The planning application pertains to the ground floor flat, No. 17. \r\rThe surrounding properties are of a similar design and appearance.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; and\r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the street, contained to the rear. In relation to the existing building, the proposed extension is considered to be of an appropriate bulk and scale extending to be flush with the rear most elevation of the building so as to read as a subservient extension to the property. The matching brick walls to the rear extension are considered acceptable, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. Fencing and gate is proposed to match that which currently exists to No. 13 adjacent.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe upper level flat (No. 19) is not considered to be materially impacted by the proposals. \r\rNo. 13 Vale Crescent is the adjoining ground floor flat to the south-east of the application property. The proposed extension would essentially infill an existing recessed element of the rear elevation of No.17 which would be sited immediately abutting the recessed element of No. 13. The proposed rear extension would measure to a depth of 4.5m along the boundary with this neighbour to a height of 3.3m.\r\rIt is noted that a separate planning application has been submitted for No. 13 for the same proposals as those under consideration in this application to No. 17 (that is, under application reference: 21/02694/FUL). As such, the neighbouring extension of identical proportions is considered to adequately mitigate the potential harm which would otherwise be caused to the adjoining neighbour.\r\rA condition would be applied to ensure that the rear extension under app ref: 21/02694/FUL is built out simultaneously as that approved here, in order to ensure that there would indeed be no loss of residential amenity to the current/future residents of No. 13 Vale Crescent. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure, subject to compliance with the attached condition relating to the application proposals submitted for the neighbouring property at No. 13.\r\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",

    "Description\rErection of single storey rear extension and alterations to ground floor fenestration on ground floor maisonette (Flat 13).\r\rConsultations\r15no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rPlanning History\rApplication reference: 12/14423/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension. Refused on 6th August 2012.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single-storey rear extension and alterations to ground floor fenestration on ground floor maisonette.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the north-eastern side of Vale Crescent and comprises of a 2-storey semi-detached dwelling which has been divided into 2no. flats. The planning application pertains to the ground floor flat, No. 13. \r\rThe surrounding properties are of a similar design and appearance.\r\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; and\r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the street, contained to the rear. In relation to the existing building, the proposed extension is considered to be of an appropriate bulk and scale extending to be flush with the rear most elevation of the building so as to read as a subservient extension to the property. The matching brick walls to the rear extension are considered acceptable, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. \r\rThe proposals also include the removal of the existing side door and attached glazing and replacement with one window. The scale and design of the proposed window would complement those two side-facing window which already exist to the ground floor, and is therefore considered acceptable. \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe upper level flat (No. 15) is not considered to be materially impacted by the proposals. \r\rNo. 17 Vale Crescent is the adjoining ground floor flat to the south-east of the application property. The proposed extension would essentially infill an existing recessed element of the rear elevation of No.13 which would be sited immediately abutting the recessed element of No. 17. The proposed rear extension would measure to a depth of 4.5m along the boundary with this neighbour to a height of 3.3m.\r\rOfficers note that the planning history of the site includes an application for similar proposals for a rear extension which was refused on the grounds of impact upon neighbouring residential amenity, specifically the impact upon No. 17, the adjacent ground floor flat.\r\rIt is noted that a separate planning application has been submitted for No. 17 for the same proposals as those under consideration in this application to No. 13 (under application reference: 21/02695/FUL). As such, the previous concerns regarding the result visually overbearing, oppressive effect of the proposed rear extension and impact on outlook would no longer apply if the proposals were approved and built out to the neighbouring property. \r\rA condition would be applied to ensure that the rear extension under app ref: 21/02695/FUL is built out simultaneously as that approved here, in order to ensure that there would indeed be no loss of residential amenity to the current/future residents of No. 17 Vale Crescent. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure, subject to compliance with the attached condition relating to the application proposals submitted for the neighbouring property at No. 17.\r\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",
    "The site comprises a commercial unit within the southern part of the Barwell Business Park which is designated as a Strategic Industrial Location (SIL).\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site is located within the southern part of the Barwell Business Park which is designated as a Strategic Industrial Location (SIL). The proposal seeks to replace the existing roof following extensive fire damage to the adjoining unit, and would replace it at a increased height. While the units within Barwell Business Park are notably uniform in appearance, officers consider that the raised height of the unit in this case would not be clearly noticeable as the increased height would be marginal and the design of the proposed roof would be very similar to existing. Further, given that the roof would be replaced in materials to match existing officers consider the proposed development to be acceptable.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rTo this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The nearest residential properties are located approximately 169 metres away, to the north and north-west of the application site and as such subject to compliance with the Demolition Plan, the proposal would have no adverse impact on the residential amenity of these neighbouring properties, in terms of light pollution, loss of outlook, sunlight/daylight, loss of privacy, or increase in noise and disturbance\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
