    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the north-western elevation of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "A1 - Loading",
    "The proposed rooflight to the roof of the rear dormer, as demonstrated on plan AMA0360/A3/0.006 - Proposed Side elevation & section AA, would be higher than the original ridge height of the existing roof contrary to Class B.1 (b) which states; Development is not permitted by Class B if any part of the dwellinghouse would, as a result of the works, exceed the height of the highest part of the existing roof.",
    "The site comprises a detached residential dwelling located to the rear of Southborough Nursing Home and is accessed via a private driveway. The site lies within Southborough Conservation Area (a designated heritage asset) and has a tree to the rear of the site which is protected via a Tree Preservation Order (TPO).\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC) - No objection.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the proposed development on character and appearance and trees;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- The impact of the development on designated heritage assets.\r\rCharacter and Design and Trees\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed two storey side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of set back from the front elevation at first floor level, or set down from the ridge line, officers note that it would be set in from the shared boundary, and the proposed roof form and materials would relate well to the character of the original dwelling. In addition, due to its subordinate and proportionate nature and private site context, officers consider that the proposed extension would not detract from the character or appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed front porch extension would have a height that is not strictly in keeping with the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013, however, it would appear as a subordinate addition in relation to the host property. Officers consider that it would not detract from the character or appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAs stated above, there is a tree protected by a TPO situated to the rear of the site. In addition and given the site's location within a Conservation Area all trees within the Conservation Area boundary are afforded protection. Due to the on-site TPO tree's proximity to the proposed extension, it is considered that there would be no harm to it's health, however, Officers note that to implement the proposal access and egress of construction traffic would be required along the private driveway. This private driveway is in close proximity to trees and therefore to ensure their health and longevity a Tree Protection Plan would be required by condition (ompleted by a suitably qualified professional) in the event of an approval.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, and that no openings are proposed to the side elevations above first floor level, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would result in the loss of the existing garage, officers note that the dwelling benefits from a hardstanding which could accommodate adequate on-site car parking. As such, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: Southborough Conservation Area originally formed part of the grounds of Southborough Estate, which centred on Southborough House. Thomas and Sarah Langley commissioned the famous Regency architect, John Nash, to build Southborough House on the former Kingston Common in 1808. The main house (14 Ashcombe Avenue), the garden building to the west, and Southborough Lodge (16 Ashcombe Avenue) are Grade II listed buildings and the oldest buildings within the area. The Ordnance Survey dated 1868 shows Southborough House and Southborough Farm (now demolished) as the only properties within the boundaries of Brighton Road, Ditton Road, and the Portsmouth to London Railway line.\r\rAs noted above, officers conclude that the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the area or result in any harm. It follows that Officers consider that there would be no harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
