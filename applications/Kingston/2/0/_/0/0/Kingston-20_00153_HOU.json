    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in strict accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in strict accordance with \"Development Tree Report\" authored by MSW (Tree) Consultancy Ltd and dated 19 August 2020. The approved measures shall be implemented prior to commencement of any work on site and maintained to the reasonable satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority until the completion of the development.\r\rReason: To safeguard trees worthy of retention and in the interests of the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.21 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character.\r \rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for the erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension and increasing roof ridge height with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rThe proposal relates to the refused planning application ref. no. 22/02238/HOU for erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension and increasing roof ridge height with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultations\r19 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would not be set back from the roof ridge by a recommended 500mm. However, considering its modest scale, the proposed design and its siting, it is considered that it would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed increase in roof height is considered to be acceptable as it would appear to be  in line with the heights of the roof of the adjoining properties and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is noted that the proposed hip to gable roof extensions and installation of rooflights would be in-keeping with the existing street scene that shows similar developments.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in harm to the significance of the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Method Statement dated 8.7.2022, which is considered to be sufficient.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Condition 8 - Refuse and recycling facilities - of planning permission 22/00665/FUL\rDetails of the waste and recycling facilities have been submitted and deemed acceptable. As such, this condition can be discharged. \r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been received relating to: \r\rReplacement of boundary treatment/Party Wall Agreement\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rLoss of light/Sunlight\rPrivacy\r\rConcerns relating to boundaries and property rights are a civil matter and are not material planning considerations which can be assessed as part of this application. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposal is an amendment of previously approved application ref: 21/02339/HOU. The proposed single storey side and rear extension sits approximately 70cm further in depth than what was approved, with the addition of a glass lantern rooflight. While the proposed extension would be in excess of recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, it is noted that the height would still be modest and that the rooflight would be a modest addition, and given that the side extension would be stepped back to 4m, it would not appear an incongruous addition to the host property. Officers consider that it would appear an appropriate addition to the character or appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the separation distance between 37 Albemarle and that this neighbouring property benefits from a rear extension, and as such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rOfficers note that 33 Albemarle also benefits from a rear extension of similar depth to the proposed extension but would be substantially separated from the shared boundary. However, it is noted that the height would remain modest on the shared boundary with No.33 reaching an eaves height of 3m. As such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
