    "Consultations\r34no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. 3no. representations have been received, all of which were objections.  The material planning concerns raised are summarised below:\r\r-access;\r-noise and disruption implications from the construction process;\r-overlooking and loss of privacy to neighbouring properties;\r-effect on tree roots;\r-flooding concerns; and,\r-overdevelopment of site.\r\rOfficer's comments: Duly noted. The Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Councils Environmental Health Department. An informative would be added to any decision to grant planning permission to detail the hours of construction to be contained between 8am - 6pm Monday-Friday, 8am - 1pm Saturday and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays. The comment raised relating to impacts on views is not material planning in the assessment of planning applications. All other concerns raised in the representations are discussed in further detail in the body of this report. \r\rRelevant Planning History\rNone.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a two- storey dwellinghouse (following demolition / refurbishment of existing garage) with associated amenity space.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r\r- The Principle of Development;\r- The Proposed Standard of Accommodation;\r- The Impact upon Residential Amenity;\r- The Impact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area; \r- The Impact upon Highway Safety;\r- Refuse and Recycling Storage;\r- The Impact upon Trees;\r- Sustainability; \r- Flood Risk; and\r- The provision of Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThe proposed development seeks to redevelop the rear of the site for residential use. \r\rThe principle of creating a new residential unit within an established residential area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies. The scheme would utilise brownfield, or previously-developed land, and so represent a sustainable form of development. Therefore, the principle of development is considered to be acceptable subject to complaince with development plan policies. \r\rStandard of Accommodation \rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan, 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                                           \rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per new house (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe application seeks to provide a two bedroom unit laid over two floors (one of which would be partially sunken), for which Policy D6 of the London Plan would require a Gross Internal Area (GIA) of 79sqm. The proposed internal floor space amounts to 80sqm thereby exceeding minimum floor space standards. \r\rPolicy D6 also requires compliance with minimum standards in terms of built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for storage is 2sqm. The proposed dwelling is not shown to have any built-in storage space provided and in this way would not comply with policy requirements. \r\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London. Higher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m throughout the ground floor and 2.7m across the majority of the first floor. This would be in compliance with standards set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe supporting text of Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed layout is largely influenced by the constraints of the site and, as a result of its cramped nature, proposes a limited number of openings that would be largely single aspect and orientated eastwards. This would result in poor outlook for the occupants. This planning application does not include a technical Daylight/Sunlight Report and, so, it has not been demonstrated that the internal floorspace, particularly the proposed sunken level which would accommodate the principal habitable rooms (i.e. living rooms and kitchen), would receive adequate levels of light in compliance with BRE targets. The windows shown to the southern elevation would be very small and set at a high level and would have no effect in terms of outlook to the accommodation. Overall, the proposal is considered to represent a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of the proposed dwelling.\r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have 50m2 of private outdoor space (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third).\r\rThe proposed dwelling would benefit from approximately 40sqm of private outdoor amenity space. When assessed against criteria for new houses, the quantum of amenity space provision would fall below guidance. \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe private amenity space of the proposed dwelling would be unduly overlooked by the upper windows of the existing property at No. 12 Ditton Road with a separation distance of approximately 9.5m. Additionally, officers note that the proposed garden area for the new dwelling would result in a reduction of the rear communal amenity space afforded to the residents of the 8no. flats of No's 12 and 14 Ditton Road. This space is already quite small in area and the resultant loss of a further 40sqm is considered to be materially harmful to the residential amenity of those occupiers of No's 12 and 14 Ditton Road.\r\rThe submitted plans show opening doors to the eastern gable end of the proposed dwelling. The doors are shown to open outwards, although no full depth balcony is shown. The Council would not accept a full balcony as this would give rise to an unacceptable degree of overlooking to neighbouring gardens. \r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document relating to privacy separation distances, specifies for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use) that the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distances will be, but in general minimum separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained using the following standards: \r\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms; \r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property; \r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r\rOfficers acknowledge that there is a separation distance of approximately 19m between the rear of No. 23 and the proposed dwelling. This remains unchanged from the current relationship between the existing garage and the back of No.23. The separation distance between the proposed rooflights to the northern roof slope of the new dwelling and the boundary between neighbouring properties is within 1m which is below the above-stated guidance.\r\rThe proposed ridge line of the proposed dwelling would be set at a maximum height of 5.1m, with 2no. rooflights to the northern roof slope. One of these rooflights would serve a bathroom and would be required to be fitted with obscure-glazing; the other rooflight to the northern roof slope would be one of two rooflights serving a bedroom. \r\rIn terms of impact to the residential amenity of those properties fronting St Matthew's Avenue, the one rooflight to the bedroom is considered to represent minimal opportunity for overlooking to the garden areas of those properties to the north and would be largely commensurate to the views obtained by those windows of the existing properties along the north side of Ditton Road.  Therefore, on balance, officers find that the proposals would not result in any unacceptable loss of privacy and the application proposal is considered to accord with Policy DM10. \r\rGiven the presence of an existing built structure on the site of a similar height and scale, albeit used in ancillary capacity as garages and with no windows to habitable accommodation, the overall scale, massing and maximum height of the proposed dwelling would not result in materially different or harmful impact on the outlook from No's 12-14 Ditton Road, nor from those properties to the north fronting St Matthew's Avenue. \r\rImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rThe application site is positioned to the rear of No's 12 and 14 Ditton Road, two 3-storey semi-detached properties which have been converted into a total of 8no. residential flats. The rear is accessed via a driveway on the west side leading to a paved courtyard, to the end of which is a brick triple garage building with a pitched roof and a centrally-set decorative pitched gable. The existing building reads as a typical ancillary structure to the rear garden area. The structure can be seen from a relatively small vantage point between the houses along Ditton Road.\r\rThe new house would be set against the rear wall of No.14 Ditton Road, utilising a very similar built footprint to the existing garages. The proposed dwelling would be partially sunken to a depth of 1.7m below the ground level, in an attempt to reduce its visual impact to neighbouring properties. \r\rThe new dwelling would be constructed of brick, with a hipped roof and would visually present as very similar to the existing garages. \r\rThe proposed development by virtue of its plot subdivision and lack of private ground around the dwelling, particularly to its front, would present as an uncharacteristically over dense pocket in the area, with a cramped appearance of overdevelopment.\r\rWhilst Officers recognise that there is currently a structure on the site where the development is proposed, the existing building is garaging which, when viewed from the Ditton Road, visually presents as an ancillary structure within the grounds of the main imposing buildings of No's 12 and 14 Ditton Road and not as a self-contained residential plot.\r\rWhilst the scale and massing of the scheme is considered modest and generally subordinate to the surrounding buildings, it is considered that the proposed design would not enhance the site, nor would it be of a sufficiently high design standard appropriate as a residential dwelling, in terms of its lack of architectural detailing and limited fenestration particularly to its southern (front) elevation. \r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 3 (good). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum car parking provision in Outer London areas with a PTAL 2-3 of up to 0.75 spaces per dwelling for 1-2 bedroom units.\r\rNo car parking spaces are proposed and Officers note that the site is not located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ). As no off-street parking would be provided and no parking beat survey has been submitted to support the application, it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety, on-street car parking provision in surrounding streets and traffic congestion in surrounding streets.\r\rTable 10.2 of the London Plan (2021) sets a minimum cycle parking provision of two spaces for a dwelling of this size.\rNo cycle storage provision has been indicated on the proposed plans. Officers are unable to determine whether this would be provided, or where any such storage would be positioned relative to the proposed dwellinghouse. As such, Officers cannot provide assessment of the adequacy of any arrangements in terms of siting and capacity. \r\rRefuse and Recycling Storage\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be set at a distance of approximately 35m from the public highway. \r\rThe submitted plans do not give details on the proposed refuse and recycling storage for the new dwelling. On this basis, there is inadequate information for Officers to assess the acceptability of waste arrangements to serve the proposed dwelling, in terms of capacity or siting for its collection by Council operatives. \r\rImpact upon Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficers note that there is a large tree in proximity to the application site, within the rear garden of No.22 St Matthew's Avenue. There are concerns that the excavation and construction works necessary for the proposed development could impact upon the root system of this tree. There has been no supporting information submitted as part of this planning application in the form of an Arboricultural Impact Assessment or Tree Protection Plan. As such, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the health and longevity of trees.\r\rSustainability\rPolicy DM3 of the Council's Core Strategy states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency and C02 reductions.\r\rFlood Risk\rParagraph 166 of the NPPF 2021 states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment. This includes all development within Flood Zones 2 and 3.\r\rDevelopment should only be allowed in areas at risk of flooding where, in light of this assessment, it can be demonstrated that:\r- Within the site, the most vulnerable development is located in areas of lowest flood risk, unless there are overriding reasons to prefer a different location.\r- The development is appropriately flood resistant and resilient.\r- It incorporates sustainable drainage systems, unless there is clear evidence that this would be inappropriate.\r- Any residual risk can be safely managed.\r- Safe access and escape routes are included where appropriate, as part of an agreed emergency plan.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 echo national policy in these regards.\r\rThe site falls within Flood Zone 2, at medium / high risk of surface water flooding. \r\rA supporting flood risk assessment has been submitted as part of the proposals. Given the inclusion of a lower ground floor level to the proposed dwelling, a number of mitigation measures are proposed which include no vents or service openings to the lower ground floor, the use of flood resilient materials up to a level of 23.87m AOD and no sleeping accommodation to the lower ground floor. A route of safe escape (i.e. an internal staircase from lower ground to ground / exit) is provided.\r\rGiven the above, the proposal is considered to be acceptable and compliant with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012. \r\rContribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 2 with a charge of £130 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rConclusion / Planning Balance\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rSignificant weight is given in the assessment of the proposals providing for one net additional residential dwellinghouse. \r\rHowever, Officers find that the proposed development would provide for poor living accommodation for future occupiers of the property, in terms of presenting as a single-aspect, east facing dwelling with restricted outlook and natural daylight/sunlight ingress. In addition, the proposed private outdoor amenity space is undersized at 40sqm in relation to criteria set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD, and given proximity to the rear of Nos. 12 and 14, the outdoor space would be overlooked to a harmful extent.\r\rThe subdivision of the plot to create a residential dwelling, as shown, would result in the loss of an area of the rear communal outdoor amenity space provided for the residents of No's 12 and 14 Ditton Road, which is noted to already be relatively constrained in size and it is considered that a further reduction by 40sqm would materially harm the outdoor amenity space enjoyed by residents of these properties. \r\rThe proposed development by virtue of its plot subdivision and lack of ground would present as an uncharacteristically over dense pocket in the area, with a cramped appearance of overdevelopment.\r\rThe proposed design is not considered to be high-quality with limited detailing and fenestration given to its front elevation and with virtually no space to its frontage which would be private to the proposed dwelling.\r\rThere has been insufficient information submitted regarding refuse/recycling storage and cycle parking storage and, so, it is unclear where the stores would be positioned and how these would be accessed for future residents. \r\rThere has also been insufficient information submitted in relation to the impact of the proposed development on the health and longevity to the nearby large treet situated within the rear garden of No.22 St Matthews Avenue. \r\rThe proposed development would be car-free. However, there is no supporting information submitted to sufficiently demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in adverse impact on highway safety in terms of parking stress on nearby roads and traffic congestion to the local highway network.\r\rIn conclusion and on balance, the delivery of one additional residential dwelling is considered not to demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits associated with standards of living accommodation, design, character and appearance, neighbouring residential amenity, highways and transportation, cycle parking, refuse, trees and waste.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. While it would be visible from the streetscene, given that it would be in materials to match the existing dwelling and would be partially screened by the boundary treatment, it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
