    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed works would not result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the longevity, health and appearance of the surrounding trees. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to comply with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site comprises of a two storey, detached dwellinghouse located on the northern side of Corkran Road. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character comprising of mainly two storey detached dwellings with relatively deep setback from the highway, screened behind mature landscaping.\r\rThe site is located within Southborough Conservation Area. The site does not comprise of a Listed Building and is located in Flood Zone 1.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey structure with glass canopy to the rear of the property. \r\rConsultation\r15no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations received.\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No comment on the proposals - neutral.\rTrees and Landscape: No response received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- The impact upon trees\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals would provide for an open-sided structure with a glass canopy atop supported by 3no. aluminium pillars. The proposed structure would be maximum 3m in height. The proposed development is considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rWith regards to heritage, Paragraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF, 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. \r\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe application site is located within Southborough Conservation Area, a non-designated heritage asset, which is an area characterised by, and derives its special architectural and historic interest from, the large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash.\r\rThe proposed structure would be sited wholly to the rear of the application property and would comprise of a generally open structure set within the existing patio / terrace area of the property, accessed from two sets of French doors. The structure would not project any further in depth from the furthest-most rear wall of the extension to the host dwelling.\r\rIt is not considered that the proposal would result in any harm to the non-designated heritage asset, that is, to the character and appearance of Southborough Conservation Area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed structure is of a scale and distance from the boundary such that it would not appear overbearing. In respect of privacy, it is noted that the terrace/patio is already in place and it is considered that the erection of a canopy above would not result in any views beyond those which are already possible. As such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or overlooking/loss of privacy. \r\rImpact upon Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rThere are a number of trees to the front of the application property which are protected by TPOs. There is also one large tree to the rear garden which is protected by a TPO, set at a distance of approximately 8m from the existing rear extension on the application property. A tree protection plan has been submitted with the application to demonstrate that protective fencing would be erected during construction.\r\rThe proposals would not be within any proximity to the on-site protected trees and, therefore, the proposals would not result in harm to the health and longevity of these trees in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and on the wider conservation area. The proposals are not considered to result in materially harmful loss of light or create opportunity for overlooking and similarly the proposed structure is not considered to be overbearing in terms of its scale and design.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\r",
