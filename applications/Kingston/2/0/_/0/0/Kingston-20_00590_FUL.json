The proposal does not propose any change to the current provision of parking and as such this concern cannot be assessed as part of this application. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side/rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of separation from the shared boundary, officers consider that it would have an appropriate depth and height, and as such would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. Given the modest scale, and that it would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties, and the modest eaves height and depth, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. As the proposal would seek to provide an extension of existing residential accommodation officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance to occupiers of neighbouring properties \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "\rSite\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Wyndham Road.

This area is characterized by Victorian Era dwellinghouses, with distinctive, well-balanced building forms, roofscapes and front gardens including boundaries, characteristic clear gaps between houses, building lines and detailing. This area was also considered for inclusion within the Canbury Conservation Area. \r\rThe application proposes the replacement of the existing timber sliding sash windows with white PVCu sliding sash windows across the dwellinghouse. The application also proposes the replacement of doors with doors to match the existing. Whilst it would be an unfortunate loss of wooden sash windows, the proposed PVCu sliding sash range which mimic historic designs would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, nor the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Local Area of Special Character. The proposed replacement of doors would have little impact on character and appearance. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

The site is within Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character. \r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage; and, \r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side/rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013, in terms of separation from the shared boundary, officers consider that it would have an appropriate depth and height, and as such would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. Given the siting and modest scale, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would not contribute to a loss of light/sunlight, sense of overbearing or contribute to a loss of privacy for No. 19 Victoria Road. Given the constraints of the site, and siting of the proposed development in relation to the closest ground floor habitable window at No. 15 Victoria Road, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of light/sunlight and sense of overbearing for neighbouring property No. 15 Victoria Road. Due to the fact that the proposed development does not propose any windows to the side elevations, there would be no loss of privacy for No. 15 Victoria Road\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would be a modest addition to the host property and would appear in keeping with host property. As such, officers consider that the proposed extension would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it. \r\rIn conclusion, given the adverse impact of proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring property No. 15 Victoria Road, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a terrace of maisonettes situated above a corner parade of shops at ground floor level. The main entrance door to each maisonette, is at first floor level to the rear of the parade of shops. There is a small car parking area and yard area to the rear of the parade of shops.\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\r18 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No representations have been received by the Council.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed dormer windows would be installed to the rear of the corner parade of shops and would not be visible from Robin Hood Way and therefore would not result in any impact on the existing Robin Hood Way street scene. The proposed design of the roof and roof dormers is considered to be proportionate and in-keeping with the host property. \rGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the siting of the dormer, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an overbearing effect. The proposed dormer would result in a slight increase in overlooking and loss of privacy to a small car parking area and yard area to the rear of the parade of shops. However, this area is already overlooked by the existing maisonettes and any increase in overlooking and loss of privacy, would not be significant enough to warrant refusal.\r\rIt is noted, that the proposal includes the conversion of loft space, into habitable room space, which would increase the internal spaciousness of an existing maisonette. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
