    "The proposed extension together with the existing enlargement  would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (ja) and  (j) (iii).",
    "This application seeks a minor material amendment to planning permission ref. 18/16584/FUL. The applicant wishes to make changes to the single storey rear extension by changing the angle of pitch and increasing its depth by 1 metre. Officers consider the proposed arrangement to be accceptable in terms of character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity and that the proposed changes would constitute a minor material amendment. As such, it is recommended that the application be granted.",
    "Please provide existing roof plan at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work."
