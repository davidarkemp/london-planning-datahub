    "The application relates to the ground floor shop front only. The ground floor unit is in use as an A1 retail unit. The site is located in a predominantly retail sector of the designated Kingston Town Centre. The site is not located in a conservation area.\r\rProposal\rAlteration to shopfront to replace aluminium facade with glass.\r\rConsultation\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No representations have been received.  \r\rRBK neighbourhood Engineer - No objection\r\rHistoric England Archaeology - On the basis of the information provided, we do not consider that it is necessary for this application to be notified to Historic England's Greater London Archaeological Advisory Service under their consultation criteria.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on Flood Risk\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe principle of altering a shopfront within a town centre location is acceptable subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rDesign \rParagraph 125 of the NPPF 2021 states that the creation of high quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe Council's Shopfront and Shopsign Design Guide SPD, 2005 states that \"Any alterations or new shopfronts should be considered in the context of the wider streetscene. Elements should relate to one another in terms of scale and location. The relationship between individual properties can contribute to an overall character, which creates an environment attractive to shoppers.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alterations comprise the replacement of aluminium framing to glazing to modernise the shop front and reflect the design and appearance of other shopfronts in the locality. \r\rOverall, the design and materials are considered to be visually unobtrusive and are considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene, thereby complying with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the replacement shop front would be of a similar siting and appearance to the existing situation, the proposal is considered not to have a detrimental visual impact upon the occupants of any nearby residential properties.  \r\rHighways and Transportation\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion, on street car parking pressure, or compromise pedestrian or highway safety.   \r\rOfficers consider that the proposals would not be significantly different from the existing situation and would therefore have no adverse impact upon highways and transportation, thereby complying with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed shopfront would not increase the amount of impermeable surface existing on site, and as such, the proposed development would have no impact on the vulnerability of the site or neighbouring sites with regards to flooding.\r\rConclusion \rThe proposed shop front alterations would be of a design that would preserve the character and appearance of the street scene and would not have a detrimental impact upon residential amenity or highways and transportation.  As such, the proposal is considered to comply with policy D3 of the London Plan, 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.  \r\r\r",
