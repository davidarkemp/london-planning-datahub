    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The flat roof elements of the proposals hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in strict accordance with the construction management plan received by email on Wednesday 22 July at 14:55 unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interests of the safety and operation of the highway network, in accordance with policy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS7 and DM9 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been received relating to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Fumes\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Privacy\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 22/00501/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the design of the proposed first floor rear extension, and in particular the flat roof. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in an extension that would have appeared visually inappropriate and out of keeping with the character of the host property and surrounding area.  Officers note that the current proposal would retain the flat roof on the proposed first floor rear extension, and instead has reduced the width of the proposed extension, given that the flat roof would remain, officers consider that the reason for refusal has not been addressed. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be appropriately set up from the eaves or sides of the roof slope in line with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, however officers note that there are a number of similar extensions viewed in the surrounding area, and as such officers consider it would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property and surrounding area.\r\rThe single storey rear extension would not strictly adhere with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given the depth (5m v. 4m), however it would have an appropriate height, and such would not appear out of proportion with the existing dwelling. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance of the proposed extensions in relation to neighbouring properties, the proposed extensions would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. \r\rWhile openings are proposed on the side elevations at first floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, in the event of an approval, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure the windows are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r22/00545/HOU - Demolition of existing rear conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension. Removal of chimney breast - Refused on 20.04.2022.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers note that application ref: 22/00545/HOU was refused for the following reasons:\r\r- Due to its scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design the proposed development would be an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area, thereby having an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of character and appearance. The proposal would conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\r- The applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room of No. 25 Parbury Rise, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant seeks to mitigate the harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and amenity of neighbouring properties by reducing the proposed depth to 5 metres from the intially proposed 6 metres.\r\rAlthough the proposed erection of single storey rear extension would be slightly visible to the streetscene, it would not significantly detract from the host dwelling or surrounding area and would generally adhere to the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD. Therefore, it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.
