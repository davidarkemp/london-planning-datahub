    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Prior to commencement of the A5 use details shall be submitted to the Local Planning Authority showing how refuse and recycling is to be stored on site and provide detail of the means by which it will be taken from the site. The use thereafter shall be carried out in accordance with the details submitted and no refuse or recycling material shall be stored or placed for collection on the public highway or pavement, except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of refuse facilities to the satisfaction of the Council in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The A5 use hereby permitted shall operate only between the hours of 10:00 to 22:00\rMonday to Sunday, with all staff to leave the premises by 22:30 hours.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "A1 - Loading",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the dwelling. The original layout of the dwelling has a rear projection and as a result the proposed extension would extend beyond an original side wall and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The development therefore conflicts with Schedule 2, Part A, paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\rThe proposal would require planning permission.\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed rear dormer roof extension would have a slightly unusual form, given that it would be set in from eaves, ridge and sides of the roofslope officers consider it would appear a subordinate addition to the host property and would not detract from the character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed side dormer roof extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale and siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rWhile there is an opening proposed to the side elevation of the dwelling at second floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure the windows is obscure-glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels, as such the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would be a modest addition to the host property and would appear in keeping with host property. As such, officers consider that the proposed extension would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Therefore, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, but rather preserve it. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
