    "Site\r\rThe application relates to a first floor flat situated within a two-storey semi-detached property located on Lingfield Avenue. The site is within a Controlled Parking Zone as well as the Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning History\r\rNo relevant planning history. \r\rConsultations\r\r17 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations were received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds of:\rLoss of sunlight \rLoss of privacy\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rInappropriate design/layout\r\rThe points raised in relation to the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area, as well as on the amenity of neighbouring properties are material planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension to the rear/side roofslope. Whilst the proposed dormer extension would not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, and would arguably not relate well to the existing roof form of the application site, Officers note that the proposed dormer extension would not dominate the rear roof slope. Furthermore, as it would be sited to the rear roofslope, it would not be visible from the streetscene. As such, Officers consider that the proposed dormer extension would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rThe application also proposes the installation of one window on the front elevation of the property, 2 no. rooflights to the front roofslope and 1 no. rooflight to the rear roofslope. These additions are considered appropriate to the dwellinghouse, and would not detract from its character. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 24, the ground floor flat at No. 26 Lingfield Avenue and No. 28 Lingfield Avenue. \r\rIn relation to both No. 24 and No. 28 Lingfield Avenue, due to the siting of the proposed extension, its scale and that no windows are proposed facing these neighbouring properties, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in a unacceptable impact on amenity through loss of sunlight, privacy or an overbearing appearance. \r\rIn relation to the ground floor flat at No. 26 Lingfield Avenue, due to the scale and siting of the proposed development in relation to this neighbouring property in conjunction with the positioning of the application site in relation to the path of the sun, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a significant loss of sunlight. Furthermore, due to the scale and siting of the proposed development, the development would not result in an overbearing appearance. \r\rMoreover, whilst the application proposes to install a new window facing the garden of this neighbouring property, as the view from this window would not be too dissimilar from the view of the existing windows at first floor level, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a significantly unacceptable loss of privacy to this neighbouring property. \r\rTo the rear of the site are the properties Nos. 31-35 Cranes Park Avenue. Whilst the proposal would introduce a new window at second floor level facing these neighbouring properties, as the proposed development would be situated over 40 metres away from these neighbouring properties, Officers are satisfied that the proposed development would not result in a significant loss of privacy through overlooking. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. As it is considered that the proposed development would result in an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, Officers consider that the proposed development would also not harm the cultural significance of the non-designated heritage asset, the Cranes Park Local Area of Special Character.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details have been assessed by relevant consultees and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details, in relation to Condition 7 (Landscaping) of planning permission 21/01891/FUL, which states:\r\rPrior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, a hard and soft landscaping scheme shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following substantial completion of the development. The tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. \r\rAny trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced during the following planting season, and the areas shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

Application Granted on 15 Jan 2010.\r\r513/MC/2 - Bathroom and WC. Application Granted on 08 Mar 1949\r\r513/MC/1 - Bathroom and WC. Application Granted on 08 Mar 1949\r\rConsultations\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation was received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds of:\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rLoss of light/Sunlight\rEncroaching on neighbouring land\rParty wall issues\rOverbearing impact\r\rThe points raised in relation to the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse/area, as well as the impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties are material planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rIn relation to the issues raised in relation to the party wall, this is a civil matter related to the Party Wall Act and not a planning concern and as such will not be discussed within the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rFinally, in relation to the points raised regarding the encroachment onto neighbouring land, this application has been amended and the proposed extension would now set back from the shared boundary with the neighbouring property at No. 8 and as such will no longer encroach on this land. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the proposed single storey side/rear extension would not strictly adhere to the guidance of the Residential Design SPD, extending approximately 5.7 metres beyond the rear wall of the existing dwellinghouse, given the existing extensions to the dwellinghouse and similar extensions at neighbouring properties, Officers consider that the proposed would not be an uncharacteristic form of development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposals to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  The principal properties to consider in relation to Amenity are No. 6 and No. 10 George Road.\r\rIn relation to No. 6 George Road, this neighbouring property benefits from a single storey rear extension, and an overhanging roof. Whilst the proposed development would extend further than this neighbouring extensions, due to the scale of the proposed development in conjunction with the existing neighbouring extension, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in a significantly unacceptable loss of light or an overbearing appearance to this neighbouring property. Furthermore, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, the application would not result in a loss of privacy to No. 6 George Road.  \r\rIn relation to No. 10 George Road, the application has been amended to be set back from the boundary of this neighbouring property by approximately 150mm, and the height of the eaves of the extension on the boundary of this neighbouring property has been reduced to approximately 2.7 metres. As such, when taking into consideration the reduced height and set back from the boundary, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an overbearing appearance to No. 10 George Road.   \r\rIn relation to the impact on sunlight, No. 10 George Road benefits from a window on the rear elevation of the property in close proximity to the proposed development. When taking a 45 degree line from the centre of this window on the floor plans provided, this line would intersect the proposed development. However, when taking a 45 degree line from the centre of this window on the elevations drawings provided, it would not intersect the proposed development. As such, whilst the proposed development may result in some loss of sunlight to this neighbouring habitable room window, Officers consider it would not be to an unacceptable level. Furthermore, the provided Solar Analysis supports this conclusion due to the positioning of windows on this neighbouring property, in relation to the proposed development and positioning of the sun throughout the day.  \r\rFinally, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, the proposal would not result in a loss of privacy. The proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rThe representations that have been received have been carefully consdiered, however, on balance, Officers concluded that the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Ellerton Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r15/16156/HOU - Erection of a single storey side rear infill extension. Application Granted on 21 Apr 2015. With conditions. (Does not appear to have been implemented).\r\rConsultations\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension which would measure approximately 6 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse. The extension would have a dual-pitched roof and would measure a maximum of 4 metres in height. Whilst the proposed extension would far exceed the recommended depth as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, in relation to the dwellinghouse in conjunction with existing extensions, Officers would still consider that the proposed extension would appear proportionate and subordinate. There would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
