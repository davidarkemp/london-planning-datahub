    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r26 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings;\r- Inappropriate design/layout;\r- Loss of light/sunlight;\r- Noise; and,\r- Privacy.\r\rOfficers note that the proposal would be for residential use, and as such it is considered that there would be no material increase in noise on site. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/02627/HOU. The principal issue with the refused application was the scale of the proposed first floor side extension and proximity on the shared boundary. The refused application would have resulted in a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, which would have eroded an existing gap between two properties on Manorgate Road. Whilst the proposed first floor side extension would not achieve total compliance with the Council's guidance, it would now be set in from the shared boundary by 1m and as such would ensure that the proposal appears visually subordinate to the host property, thereby addressing this issue.\r\rThe proposal would raise the ridge of the existing roof slope, however, given the roof ridge is substantially lower than neighbouring properties, officers consider that the increase would not appear incongruous within the immediate vicinity.\r\rWhile the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013, given that it would not be set down appropriately from the ridge line, it would be appropriately set in from the sides of the roof slope and in from the eaves, and as such would appear as a proportionate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed front extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, and that the proposal would meet the 45-degree test in relation to the closest habitable windows of neighbouring properties in plan view, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rWhile new openings are proposed to the side elevations at first and second floors of the proposed development, to mitigate against any potential loss of privacy/overlooking, in the event of an approval officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that the openings are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street parking. The hard standing to the front of the property would accommodate 2 car parking spaces. Despite this level of provision exceeding the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, 2021, as this would reflect the existing situation, this matter would not warrant grounds for refusal.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage, the proposal would include a cycle store on site which is acceptable.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Site Description\rThe site comprises a linked residential dwelling located on the southern side of Lingfield Avenue.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultation\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rProposal\rThe proposal relates to the replacement of the flat roof of the existing side extension with a pitched roof.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed alteration to the roof would be clearly visible within the streetscene. Whilst its relationship with the hip to gable roof extension achieved under application 21/02977/CEU would not be ideal, the form of the proposed roof in this case would be similar to alterations made to the neighbouring property, No. 50 Lingfield Avenue and would be finished in in-keeping materials and therefore would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the streetscene or the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. Therefore, overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

Once approved, any measures necessary to meet the targets shall be maintained throughout the lifetime of the development.\r\rReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation, in accordance with policies CS1, DM3 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r\rThe applicant has provided a statement arguing that:\r\r-\tCO2 emissions are not relevant to a conversion which is subject to Part L 1B of the Building regulations, not Part L1A for new build development. The SAP software for Part L1B compliance has no facility to calculate CO2 emissions. Further, Part L1B of the Building Regulations contains no CO2 emissions reduction target or requirements.\r\r-\tThe reduction in water consumption is taken from Part G of the Building Regulations and again is only intended for new building dwellings. To reduce existing dwellings to a water consumption of 105 lp/d is going to require renewing existing fittings and is now what Part G was introduced for.\r\rIt is accepted that this is a retrospective application for the conversion of an existing building, with only minor additional extensions, and that the CO2 reductions requirements set out in Condition 6 (and DM1 of the Core Strategy) do not apply to such developments. However, the water efficiency requirements remain valid and the applicant has agreed to retain the condition, removing only those parts that relate to CO2 reductions.\r\rConclusion\rOverall, the variation of condition 6 of planning permission 20/03084/FUL is accepted and the proposal is not in conflict with Policy DM1 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\r",

Granted advert consent, 6 August 2019.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the erection of two storey rear extension to first and second floors to create 2no. two-bedroom self-contained flats with associated amenity space, refuse/recycling facilities and cycle storage. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe site is located on the southern side of Ewell Road. It comprises of a three-storey building which forms part of a terrace, near to the junction of Ewell Road with Douglas Road. The first and second floor are in residential use.\r\rThe site forms part of the Ewell Road South Local Centre and the surrounding area is mixed in character comprising commercial and residential uses.\r\rThe site is not located within a Conservation Area or a Local Area of Special Character and the building is not listed. The site is not located within a Flood Risk Zone.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- The Principle of the Development;\r- Housing Mix;\r- The Standard of Accommodation;\r- The Character and Appearance of the Area;\r- The Amenities of Neighbouring Occupiers;\r- Transportation;\r- Refuse and Recycling; \r- Sustainability\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF. Therefore, the 'tilted balance' as set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF is engaged. Please refer to the last section of this report for the planning balance assessment.\r\rThe site is in an established residential area and its use for residential purposes is well established. The principle of creating 2no. new residential units within an established residential area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rHousing Mix\rPolicy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy states that housing developments should incorporate a mix of unit sizes and provide a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3 or more bedroom units, unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable.\r\rThe proposal submitted in this application remains unchanged from that as previously refused, in that two 2-bed units are proposed. The proposed unit mix would be contrary to Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rSupporting justification has been provided to demonstrate that it is not possible to accommodate a 3-bed unit in the accommodation mix and that to meet the required minimum floorspace standards, this would require further extensions which would be harmful to the external rear elevation and negatively impact upon neighbouring amenity. Officers give this moderate weighting against the proposals.\r\rAs the Council is in 'tilted balance', the conflict with Policy DM13 would need to be balanced by the overall economic, environmental and social benefits of the development. The final section of this report covers the planning balance assessment.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the following unit sizes and floor areas:\r-\tUnit 1: 2-bed, 3-person flat. Proposed 63.7sqm GIA.\r-\tUnit 2: 2-bed, 3-person flat. Proposed 61.0sqm GIA.\r\rAccording to the standards, dwellings of these sizes should have the following minimum floor area:\r-\t2-bed, 3-person flat. Minimum GIA of 61sqm.\r\rBoth of the proposed dwellings would either meet or exceed the minimum space standards.\r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standards for storage are set at 2.0sqm. The proposed dwellings would meet these requirements.\r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rThe proposed bedrooms would be compliant with these space standards. \r\rCeiling Heights\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would have a floor to ceiling heights of 2.5m or more throughout the first, second floors. This would be in compliance with standards set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rAll of the proposed units will be dual aspect with a good level of natural light provision, outlook and ventilation. \r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 (PG13) of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013) sets out that 10sqm of private amenity space should be provided per flat. \r\rThe proposed flats at first and second floor level will have their own private amenity space to the rear of the building in the form of terraces of approximately 10sqm and 9sqm in area respectively, orientated in a south-westerly direction.\r\rThe communal amenity terrace area at first floor level would extend to approximately 20sqm (of usable space, excluding the through passageway) which not be to the required quantum as set out in Policy Guidance 14 of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rOfficers note that this would be unchanged from the previously refused scheme. The applicant has stated in the submission that it would not be possible to increase the size of the communal amenity space without adding further bulk to the rear of the building, negatively impacting upon neighbouring amenity. Officers acknowledge the inherent constraints of the site and resultant limitations around the ability to increase communal amenity provision. Similarly, Officers recognise that the scheme would propose two units of a total maximum occupation of six persons and also note the proximity of two local parks (i.e. Fishponds Park and Alexandra Park) approximately 300m distance from the site, which could provide additional recreation opportunities. \r\rOn balance, Officers consider taking into account the inherent constraints of the building/site, the proposed provision of private amenity space and the proximity of recreation space within close proximity of the application site that the shortfall in the communal amenity space would in this instance not result in a poor-quality residential environment or negatively harm the amenity of future occupiers to such an extent to warrant refusal on these grounds. \r\rFire Safety\rA Fire Strategy has been submitted with this application to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety, in accordance with Policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rOverall\rThe proposed dwellings would both meet the requirements of the nationally described space standards in terms of internal living accommodation and, this combined with the proposed layout of the accommodation, is considered to represent good-quality, functional internal floor space with good provision of natural light, outlook, ventilation and storage space. \r\rThe applicant has demonstrated through the submission of an independent fire strategy that the proposed development would be afforded adequate levels of fire safety.\r\rBoth of the proposed units would be provided with private amenity space in accordance with the Council's standards set out for the size of amenity space and the proposed communal amenity space whilst below standards has been demonstrated by the applicant to be the maximum quantum which is feasible on the site without creating harmful additional bulk to the rear of the building.\r\rOfficers conclude that the proposed dwellings would offer good quality standard of accommodation for future occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThis application proposes the erection of a rear extension to the first and second floors of 312 Ewell Road. \r\rThe existing character and appearance of this part of Ewell Road is mixed. On the northern side, the typology is typically detached or semi-detached housing, with accommodation set within the roofscape. On the southern side, larger three-storey houses, apartment blocks and mixed buildings comprising of commercial and residential uses exist. \r\rThe application site, i.e. No. 312, form part of a short terrace of seven properties with retail or commercial uses at ground floor and residential at first and second floor. No's 296-304 to the west of the application site along Ewell Road form a three-storey terraced row with a consistent flat roof form. Similarly, the row which this application building forms part of (i.e. No's 310-320 Ewell Road) appears from street level as a three-storey terrace with a consistent roof form. No. 308 the adjacent property to the west positioned to the corner with Douglas Road is a relatively modest two-storey building with a hipped roof. \r\rThe proposed rear extension would be stepped in appearance over first and second floors with flat roof finishes and rear roof terraces. The proposed rear extension would generally correspond in design, scale and appearance terms to that which has been granted at the nearby site (i.e. No's 318-320) under planning permission reference: 19/02482/FUL.\r\rOverall, officers consider that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe proposed rear extension to No.312, at first floor level, would project beyond the original rear building line by approximately 3.1m.  The remainder of the flat roof of the existing ground floor extension would be utilised as part private terrace and part communal amenity space with 1.8m high privacy screens to either side, adding to the bulk of the building. \r\rThis would reduce the outlook to both neighbouring properties at No. 310 and 314, however at first floor level the proposals are not considered to be so harmful as to give rise to concerns regarding loss of outlook or sense of overbearing given that the built form of the extension is limited to 3.1m in depth.\r\rAt second floor, the proposed rear extension to No. 312 would project to a depth of approximately 4.4m from the rear building line. This is noted as not to be in breach of the 45-degree line for either neighbouring window and so would not result in material loss of light to either neighbouring habitable rooms. \r\rIn respect of privacy, the proposed flats would benefit from views similar to those which exist from the existing windows in the rear elevation of the parade. Privacy screens would be erected to the side of the proposed terraces to prevent any views to the side. Those dwellinghouses which have been granted planning permission to the east of the site (under permission reference 19/02482/FUL) would have their front windows fitted with privacy louvres to give oblique views to the side. However, the railings at the rear have not been shown to include any privacy screening but instead open railings and so there would be the opportunity for increased overlooking towards the rear gardens of those properties fronting Douglas Road. However, this could be dealt with via condition to ensure the terraces had 1.8m high privacy screens around their perimeter. \r\rThe proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision or privacy of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rPolicy DM09 and DM10 aims to ensure new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not compromise highway safety or contribute to traffic congestion. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 2, which represents a poor level of accessibility by means of public transport. Policy 6.1 within Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021 requires the proposed development to have a maximum of 2.25 car parking spaces. \r\rNo parking provision is proposed. The application site is not located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ), but is located within close proximity (approx. 300m) to a CPZ. \r\rGiven that the application site is located in proximity of a controlled parking zone, it is considered that the proposed car-free development could be acceptable. However, this is subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement to prohibit the future owners/occupiers of the proposed flats from obtaining on-street resident parking permits. \r\rThe applicant has agreed and signed a legal agreement to prevent occupiers or visitors to the proposed development from obtaining residents parking or visitors parking permits to mitigate any parking pressures, the proposed development would comply with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.  \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards. Development proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for a minimum of 4no. cycle parking spaces. It is proposed that a cycle store would be sited to the rear yard area, underneath the external rear staircase. The plans show that the cycle store would be a secure structure with a capacity of 4no. cycles. Both the design and quantum is considered appropriate and is in line with minimum cycle standards set out in policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rThe plans show that the waste and recycling bins will be stored within the rear yard to the application site. It is noted that the siting of the bin store to serve this proposed development would be adjacent to the location of the bin store approved under application reference: 19/02482/FUL. This store is within approximately 10m of the highway to Douglas Road and would, as such, be within the specified dragging distance for Council operatives to collect the bins. A condition is recommended to ensure that these bins are contained within a suitably high-quality, ventilated enclosure.\r\rSustainability \rPolicy 5.1 of the London Plan states that there is an aim to achieve an overall reduction in London's carbon dioxide emissions of 60 percent (below 1990 levels) by 2025. Furthermore, Policy 5.2 states that development proposals should make the fullest contribution to minimising carbon dioxide emissions in accordance with the following points; use less energy, supply energy efficiently, use renewable energy. Policy 5.3 states that the highest standards of sustainable design and construction should be achieved in London to improve the environmental performance of new developments and to adapt to the effects of climate change over their lifetime. \r\rPolicy CS1, CS2 and DM1 to DM3 of the Core Strategy seeks to ensure that all development is designed and built to make the most efficient use of resources and contribute to climate change mitigation and adaptation by: reducing CO2 emissions during construction and throughout the lifetime of the development; building to the highest sustainable design and construction standards; and minimising water consumption. \r\rA condition is added agreeing Co2 reductions (ENE1) and internal water storage (WAT1) standards equivalent to Codes for Sustainable Homes Level 4.  \r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 4, for which the charge is £50 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5-year housing supply. The proposed development would provide 2no. additional market housing units. The proposal would therefore make a small yet positive, contribution towards boosting housing delivery within the Borough. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. These matters are both afforded significant weighting in favour of the proposals.\r\rHowever, the development would not comply with policies regarding housing mix, with an absence of three bedrooms or more as part of the proposed scheme. The applicant has in this instance satisfactorily demonstrated that the required 3-bed+ provision is not possible. In this instance, Officers assign neutral weighting to this matter.\r\rThe communal amenity space would also be undersized according to local standards. Officers are satisfied that the proposed communal amenity space is the maximum possible to be provided on this site. In this instance, Officers assign neutral weighting to this matter.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a signed legal agreement to prevent the issue of on-street car parking permits and the proposal would not exacerbate pressure for on-street parking and prejudice highway safety. The proposed development would be provided with the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces and therefore adequately promotes sustainable modes of travel to future occupants of the development. This is afforded moderate weighting in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe proposed development has been found to be in conflict with the development plan on two matters relating to housing mix and communal amenity space, however Officers are now satisfied that these both do not warrant refusal and it is considered that the benefits of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits of the provision of two 2-bedroom flats in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rAccordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted for the development.\r",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to loss of privacy. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would replace an existing outbuilding that is considerably larger in scale, and while the proposed outbuilding would still have a large footprint, it would have a modest height and would appear proportionate in relation to the existing dwelling and application site. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rThe closest neighbouring property would be located 18m away from the proposed development. While it is acknowledged that small openings are proposed to the side elevations, with glass doors to the front and rear of the outbuilding, it is considered that these features would not result in a material loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, given that it would offer similar views to what is existing. Overall, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk information states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set 100mm higher than the existing floor level of the outbuilding, and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate. Officers also note that the proposed outbuilding would be of a significantly smaller footprint than the existing and therefore there would be less impermeable surface area on site. Given the small scale of the proposed development, it is considered that the introduction of a green roof and SuDS would not be appropriate in this case. Overall, the proposal is considered to be in compliance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Condition 5 (Part C) Drainage -The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that Condition 5 (Part C) of planning permission of NMA Permission 21/00927/NMA on Planning Permission 19/01228/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Consultation Responses\rFlood Risk & Drainage Officer: No comments received\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comments received.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises a four storey building known as Hanover House, situated on the west side of the High Street, New Malden. The building appears to be commercial at the ground floor level with residential accommodation above.\rThe application site is located within New Malden District Centre. The site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 4 (good).\r\rProposal\rThe proposals include: first floor rear extensions to create 2x studio flats and to extend an existing 1x bedroom first floor flat to convert it to a 2x bedroom flat.\r\rRelevant History\rA number of recent planning permission and advertisement consents have been granted in relation to the ground floor commercial unit. Regarding the residential accommodation above, the following planning permissions are most relevant:\r\r98/4176/FUL - Conversion of existing third floor flat to 2 self contained studio flats with elevational alterations - Granted 10/11/1998\r\r98/4071/FUL - Conversion of offices on first and second floors 2 one bedroom and 2 two bedroom flats, alterations to third floor to form 2 bedroom flat and elevational alterations - Granted 01/12/1998\r\rAssessment\rPrinciple of Development\r\rPolicy CS10 of the Core Strategy seeks to increase housing delivery within the borough. The proposal provides for 2 x studio flats and the conversion of an existing 1 bedroom flat into a 2 bedroom flat. The provision of additional housing is considered to be acceptable in principle. \r\rIt should be noted that currently the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. As such, paragraph 11 of the NPPF stipulates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impact, as  required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF. The planning balance assessment will form the last section of this report.\r\rAgent of Change\rPolicy D13 (Agent of Change) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that development should be designed to ensure that established noise and other nuisance-generating uses remain viable and can continue or grow without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them. Development proposals should manage noise and other potential nuisances by: \rensuring good design mitigates and minimises existing and potential nuisances generated by existing uses and activities located in the area exploring mitigation measures early in the design stage, with necessary and appropriate provisions including ongoing and future management of mitigation measures secured through planning obligations \rseparating new noise-sensitive development where possible from existing noise-generating businesses and uses through distance, screening, internal layout, sound-proofing, insulation and other acoustic design measures\r\rPolicy D13 sets out that: 'Boroughs should not normally permit development proposals that have not clearly demonstrated how noise and other nuisances will be mitigated and managed.'\r\rIt is noted that the ground floor of the site is in commercial use, along with adjoining Dawson House and neighbouring buildings also. There also appears to be a number of air conditioning units, plant and other equipment in close proximity to the boundary of the application site. The existing servicing area for the ground floor commercial unit would be retained and would be directly beneath the proposed balconies.\r\rNo Noise Assessment or other evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed flats would not prejudice the ongoing operation of neighbouring businesses without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them. The proposal therefore fails in this regard.\r\rCharacter & Design\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) setes out that: \"Development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design.\r\rAlong the southern shared boundary, the first floor rear extension would be approximately 13.6m in depth, have a maximum height of 7.3m (when measured from ground floor level) or approximately 3.2m from the first floor level to the roof. The proposed extensions would span the width of the property at the rear elevation (approximately 10.9m) with a flat roof form. The proposals include an enclosed terrace of approximately 17.5sqm in size which would abut the northern site boundary. The terrace would serve as a lightwell to the surrounding flats but would be accessible to the extended 2x bedroom flat only.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extensions would be situated to the rear of Hanover House and would not be visible from High Street. The proposed development would have a bulky and blocky appearance when viewed from Sussex Place to the rear, however, it would be of a similar appearance to adjoining Dawson House and would therefore not have any significant adverse impact on the character of the area.\r\rWhile the proposal would not enhance the character and appearance of the area, it is noted that development off Sussex Place is piecemeal and comprises a mixture of residential and commercial uses. Within this context, it is considered that the proposal development would be of an acceptable appearance. \r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).\rFirstly, it is noted that no Daylight & Sunlight Assessment has been submitted. It has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed dwellings and the extended flat would receive acceptable levels of daylight and sunlight. Given that habitable room outlook to the extended flat would be onto the proposed development/the site boundary, Officers have significant concerns about the daylight, sunlight and levels of outlook.\r\rThe proposed Studio flats would function with a single aspect once first floor windows on the side elevation and private terrace elevation are obscurely glazed and fixed shut so as to preserve neighbouring amenity. With deep floor plates and a western aspect it is unclear whether the proposed studio flats would receive adequate levels of daylight or sunlight. The proximity of neighbouring flats and car parking would not be conducive to good levels of privacy or outlook.  \rAs is noted in the 'Agent of Change' section above, no Noise Assessment or other evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that noise levels for the proposed flats would be acceptable, given the close proximity of commercial uses below and adjoining the site.\r\rThe proposed studio flats would not provide the minimum 10sqm private amenity space and no communal amenity space would be provided, contrary to Policies DM10 and DM11 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design SPD (2012). It is unclear whether the proposed courtyard for the extended flat would provide a good standard of amenity given its position within the built form.\r\rOverall, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed flats and extended flat would receive adequate levels of daylight, sunlight and would not be subject to unacceptable levels of noise from neighbouring businesses. Furthermore, the flats in question would function with a single aspect, would have poor levels of outlook and the proposed studio flats would have insufficient private amenity space. Officers are unable to conclude that the proposed development would provide a good standard of accommodation for occupants.\r\rUnit Mix\rPolicy DM13 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 states that the Council will ensure that the housing delivered is of high quality and the most appropriate type.  The Policy also states that new residential development is expected to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types.  The Policy requires that 30% of the proposed units should be 3 or more bedrooms (which are capable of family occupation) unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable. \r\rThe site is considered to be suitable for 3 or more bedroom units, as has been supported by the Planning Inspectorate elsewhere within the Borough (APP/Z5630/W/19/3223667). \r\rThe proposal would provide 2x studio flats and would extend an existing 1 bedroom flat to convert it to a 2 bedroom flat. The proposal as a whole would fail to provide a minimum of 30% 3 or more bedroom units on site, contrary to Policy DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rImpact on Neighbouring Residential Amenity\rThere appears to be residential accommodation at the first and second floor levels at Nos. 121 and 123 High Street to the north of the application site. However, any loss of daylight/sunlight and undue sense of enclosure would primarily affect what appear to be larger roof terraces at the rear. It is therefore unlikely that any adverse impact would be significant. \rWhile there would appear to be residential accommodation at the adjoining property Dawson House, there do not appear to be any habitable room windows which would be directly affected by the proposals. While there would be some loss of privacy to flats to the west at Charnwood Close, this impact would be minor as it would be largely onto communal areas/accessways.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposal would not have any significant adverse impact on the amenities of neighbours.\r\rHighways & Parking \rThe proposed flats would not have any on-site car parking and the site is not located within a CPZ. The site is located within a PTAL 4 with good accessibility to public transport links. Subject to the proposed development being secured by legal agreement as 'car-free', that is precluding residents of the proposed flats applying for on-street car parking permits, in the event that a CPZ is brought into effect, it is considered that the proposal would be acceptable in terms of car parking provision. \r\rIt is stated in the Design and Access Statement that a bike store for the studio flats would be located behind the stair enclosure, however, details of this are not included on the drawings and it is unclear whether there is space for a secure bike store given that this area of the site is used for servicing the commercial unit.\r\rRefuse & Recycling \rIt is stated that a timber clad bin store would be located under the balcony and would be for the use of the 2 studio flats only. While a bin store is shown on the proposed rear elevation, it is unclear whether there is sufficient space for the proposed store given the commercial use of this part of the site.\r\rPlanning Balance/Conclusion\rThe proposal would provide a net increase of 2 studio flats on site and would increase an existing 1 bedroom flat into a 2 bedroom flat; this would make a positive, albeit modest, contribution toward meeting the Council's housing targets.\rHowever the proposed studios and extended flat would fail to provide a good standard of accommodation, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed flats would not prejudice the ongoing development of neighbouring businesses, the proposed unit mix would not contribute towards meeting the identified need for 3 or more bedroom units, it has not been demonstrated that on-site secure cycle parking and waste storage could be accommodated for the proposed studios.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the adverse impacts identified above would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the scheme. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.\r",

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Henley Drive. The site is subject to a blanket Tree Protection Order, as well as situated within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rConsultations\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rTrees and Woodland - No comments. \r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer - The proposed gates/railing would not impair existing visibility splays. The replacement gates are indicated as opening inwards so as not to obstruct the public highway and no changes are proposed to the existing vehicle crossover.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on TPO trees. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the erection of a 2 metre high fence and gate to the front boundary of the property. Whilst uncommon along Henley Drive, some properties do already benefit from a high walls and gated entrances on the front boundary. As such the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficers Comments: The Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill SASC constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough. Officers consider that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. Subsequently officers consider that the proposed development would not harm the cultural significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: Consideration has been given to ensure the proposed gates and railing would not impair existing visibility splays. Additionally the proposed gates would open inwards so as not to obstruct the public highway. As such, Officers consider that the proposed development would not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. \r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application site is subject to a blanket TPO area. However, Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect trees on site. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\rLoss of light\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rPrivacy \r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application would propose a single storey rear extension of similar dimensions to previously refused app 21/01540/HOU. Given that the proposed rear extension would extend to meet the existing rear outbuilding, the depth of the proposed extension would not meet the requirements set out in the Residential Design SPD. However, given that the height of the proposed extension has been reduced and that the roof form would appear more in keeping with the original dwelling, officers consider that the proposed extension would appear a more proportionate addition to the host property and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would sit on a raised platform, the proposed development would pass the 45-degree plan test in relation to the closest habitable windows of the neighbouring properties. As such, the proposed development is considered not to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rOfficers note that a raised patio forms part of the proposals which would abut the shared boundary with No. 91 Brockenhurst Avenue. This could result in loss of privacy and overlooking, however, it is considered that this issue could be resolved by appropriate boundary fencing and enforced via condition in the event of an approval.  Subject to the satisfaction of a boundary condition, the proposed development is considered not to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to excessive height or bulk of buildings, inappropriate design/layout, and loss of light/sunlight. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would not conform to the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth and height, and as such would appear a bulky an incongruous addition to the host property, officers consider that it would not uphold the character and appearance of surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would have an appropriate depth and would be set down from the ridge of the original roofslope, however it would have a flat roof which would not conform to the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such would not appear in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling.\r\rThe proposed rear roof extension would not be set in from the eaves or sides of the roof slope or down from the ridge of the roof slope and as such would appear a dominant and bulky addition at roof level which would appear an incongruous addition within the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would pass the 45-degree elevation test in relation to the closest habitable windows of neighbouring properties No. 114 and 118 Elmbridge Avenue, given that the substantial depth of the proposed ground floor extension and close proximity of the rear extension in relation to No. 118 Elmbridge Avenue officers consider the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of No. 118 Elmbridge Avenue by reason of overbearing appearance. \r\rWhile openings are proposed at first floor level on the south elevation of the proposed development, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition in the event of an approval to ensure that the openings are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
