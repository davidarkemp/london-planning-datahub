    "The applicant is reminded of the need to ensure that all necessary highways licenses/permits are in place.\r\rThe applicant should also arrange with RBK Highways for a highway condition survey to be completed before commencing work.\r\rIf the temporary construction vehicular access is not utilising an existing crossover (which may in any case need to be strengthened) then the applicant must also arrange with RBK Highways for a new temporary crossover to be installed. The construction vehicles must not mount the kerb and the contractor is not permitted to work on the highway by constructing a temporary crossover themselves without a s278 Highways agreement being in place.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed roof plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged.\r\rThe submitted roof plans do not have a North point."
