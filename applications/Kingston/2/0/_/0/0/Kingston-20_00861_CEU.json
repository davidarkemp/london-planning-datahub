    "The proposed  alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 7, Class A of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located on the nnorth eastern side of The Ridge.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and garden shed (play room)\r\rConsultation\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one objection has been received raising the following summarised concerns:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings;\r- Inappropriate design/layout; and,\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use.\r\rOfficer comment: The objector has raised concerns that the proposed outbuilding could be used as a separate unit of accommodation. Should the application be approved, a condition restricting use to one ancillary to the main house would be applied.\r\rThe other matters will be assessed below.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies;\r- Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth.\r- Extensions with a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height.\r- If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the 4m depth of the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly conform with the requirements of the SPD, but consider that the proposed extension would be subordinate and proportionate and relate well to the existing dwelling. It would not be clearly visible from the street. Furthermore, Officers note that neighbouring properties such as No.18 The Ridge appear to have a single storey rear extensions that exceeds 3.5m in depth. \r\rSimilarly, whilst the size of the proposed shed would be large, it is considered in keeping with the character and appearance of the existing dwelling, of an appropriate scale in relation to the site, plot and prevailing pattern of development and would not be visible from the street.\r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 22 and No. 26 The Ridge. Due to the generous plot sizes on The Ridge, the relationship between the neighbouring properties and the application site and the seperation distances between them, it is considered that neither the proposed single storey rear extension or the shed would ot adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy to an unacceptable degree.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
