    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012;\r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012; and,\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on the northern side of Bodley Road.\r\rThe buildings on site are not listed, or locally listed and the site does not fall within a conservation area.  There are no trees on site which are proptectred by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO).\r\rProposal\rThe proposal involves the erection of a rear dormer roof extension, juliet balcony and the installation of three rooflights to the front roofslope.\r\rConsultation\r8 neighbouring properties were consulted. 1 representation was received (outside of the formal consultation period) which raised the following summarised concern:\r-Noise arising from construction work\r\rOfficer comment:  The objection mentioned above did not specify what construction works were occurring on site or what they related to. It should be noted that there will inevitably be some disturbance during building work, however, and notwithstanding,  the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Councils Environmental Health Department. The objector is advised to contact the Environmental Health Department as appropriate.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed works would not result in an unreasonable level of noise or disturbance.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the property has already secured planning permission under ref. 20/02598/HOU for works including side and rear extensions at ground and first floor level. The proposed dormer roof extension subject of this application would occupy a relatively small area of the roof and is considered to relate well to the application property. The materials would match the existing building and this would be secured by condition. The proposed front rooflights would be of a size and positioning that would mean they would not cause any harm to the character and appearance of the application property or the street scene.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: No side elevation windows are proposed in the dormer window and it is considered that neither the juliet balcony, or rooflights would result in loss of privacy/overlooking over and above the existing situation. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
