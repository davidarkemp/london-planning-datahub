    "The proposed replacement windows would constitute development as defined by the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) and that development does not benefit from permitted development. The property is not a dwelling house as defined in the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order (England) 2015, it is a flat. Permitted development rights do not extended to flats. \r\r\r",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Bridge Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development;\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Side extensions should be subordinate to the host dwelling and should not compromise the amenity of the neighbouring properties. As such, it is essential that careful consideration be given to the size, positioning, design and materials of any extension. The proposed extension has not been set in from the boundary by at least 250mm to ensure guttering does not overhang adjoining land, nor has it been set back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm. Officers also note the excessive height of the proposed extension. Whilst the proposed development would not meet the recommendations outlined in Policy Guidance 35 (Single Storey Side Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD, the proposed development is not un-characteristic within the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal involves the removal of an existing garage. Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least one off-street car parking space. The proposed parking provision retained would therefore comply with the maximum standards set out in the London Plan and be unlikely to contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage and storage therein and the loss of access to the rear garden, as well as the fact that no details have been given to indicate that there would be secure onsite cycle storage, Officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition for the applicant to provide details of secure cycle storage prior to the occupation of the proposed extension. \r\rIn conclusion and subject to conditions the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
