    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the building shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The roof of the rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that Condition 3 (Materials) of planning application 17/15107/FUL is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved. \r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree. \r\rThe application seeks to amend the colour of the windows, doors and roof tiles on the front elevation of the dwellinghouse. Given that the dwellinghouse sits within the Kingston Hill Conservation Area, in this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance of the area, and impact/harm to designated heritage assets. As such, the proposed changes are considered not to be non-material.",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependant on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. The local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to impact to daylight/sunlight and increase in overbearing appearance. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would not strictly accord with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013, in terms of set in from the shared boundary, it would simply infill the existing undercroft and would not project beyond the side elevation of the existing first floor side extension. As such, officers consider that the proposed development would create a more coherent appearance that would not only enhance the character and appearance of the original building,but the surrounding area also.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would sit up hard against the shared boundary, given that it would not project beyond the side elevation of the existing first floor side extension and would not include any windows in the side elevation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy over and above the existing situation.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that despite the infill of the undercroft as part of the proposals, there would be no change to off-street car parking provision on site. \r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, particularly due to the loss of the side access to the rear of the property, officers consider that further details could be ensured via condition to ensure compliance.\r\rOverall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
