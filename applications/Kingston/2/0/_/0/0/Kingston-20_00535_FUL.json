    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located to the south of The Mount, New Malden.\rThe existing building is not locally or statutorily listed and is not within a Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side and rear extension\r\rConsultations \r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and no representations were received.\r\rPlanning History\r21/02745/CEU - Erection of a rear dormer roof extension, installation of two windows and 1no. rear rooflight  to facilitate loft conversion. Granted 20.10.2021.\r21/01407/HOU - Erection of single storey rear/side extension and rear dormer roof extension - Refused 23.08.2021\rReasons for Refusal:\r1.\tThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would be of an excessive size and would represent poor design that would be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 (Character, Design and Heritage) and DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions)) of the Core Strategy (April 2012) and Policy Guidance 39 (Dormer Windows) of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The previous application (21/01407/HOU) was refused on the basis that the rear dormer roof extension was considered to be unacceptable in terms of design, scale, form and bulk. A lawful development certificate (21/02745/CEU) has since been approved for the rear dormer which is shown on the plans.\r\rNo concerns were raised in relation to the side and rear extension. The depth of the rear extension has increased from 4m to 4.3m through this proposal but the height remains the same. The proposed side extension does not fully comply with the guidance set out in Policy 35 of the Residential Design SPD (in terms of width and set back from the front elevation) but this is considered acceptable on the basis of the existing situation/garage and as it will not give a different appearance from the street. The extension steps up in height as extends to the rear but this is sufficiently set back. \r\rOverall, the proposed side and rear extension is considered subordinate in scale to the main dwelling, appropriate in design and is not unreasonable in height (flat roof of 3.3m), broadly matching the height of neighbouring extensions. For these reasons, the proposal would not have an adverse impacts on the character and appearance of the area and is considered in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 (Character, Design and Heritage) and DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions)) of the Core Strategy (April 2012) and Policy Guidance 33 and 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  No concerns were raised through the previous application in relation to the side and rear extension. With regard to No. 9 The Mount, this property has an existing extension and the proposed rear extension extends only marginally beyond this and so the proposal is not considered to result in an undue impact on the amenity of this neighbour in terms of visual intrusion, loss of daylight, sunlight or privacy.\r\rWith regard to No. 5 The Mount, the proposed extension extends to the neighbour boundary and approximately 3.4m beyond the rear extension of this neighbour. This, combined with the height of the extension (3.65 to the parapet) which is not considered unreasonable, is not considered to result in an undue impact to the amenities of this neighbour in terms of visual intrusion, loss of daylight, sunlight or privacy. The larger rear extension to the neighbouring dwelling has a window directly facing the proposed extension but this is a secondary window and no concerns are raised in terms of amenity.\rIn summary, the proposal is considered in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rOverall, the proposed side and rear extension is considered acceptable by reason of its design, siting, scale, height and depth and  would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area, existing building or the amenities of neighbours. The proposal is therefore in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 33 and 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Alexandra Drive. The site is partly located within Flood Zone 2. \r\rConsultations\r\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on drainage. \rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal involves the removal of an existing garage. Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least one off-street car parking spaces. The proposed parking provision retained would therefore be unlikely to contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
