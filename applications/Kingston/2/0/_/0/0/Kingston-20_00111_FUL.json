    "In the absence of a Sequential Test Assessment, it is considered that no compelling justification has been submitted to demonstrate that the change of use from a workshop to a more vulnerable residential use would be acceptable in this Flood Risk Zone 2 location, and that the proposal would not expose the resulting dwellinghouse to unacceptable flood risk, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Planning Practice Guidance, Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM 4 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The assessment of this application is based on the original layout of the dwelling that shows an outrigger. Therefore the proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the original side elevation of the dwelling and would be contrary to  Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii).",
    "The fee required for your planning application is Â£174.00.  Payment can be made via either our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002, or online via the Kingston council website."
