    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "A Travel Plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to first occupation of the development hereby approved. The details submitted shall be designed to manage the transport needs of the employees, in order to demonstrate a car restraint policy for the site, minimise car usage and promote alternative modes of transport. This must include details on the number of employees at site. The approved scheme shall be implemented at the time of first occupation of the development and shall be retained for the life of the development.\r\rReason: To ensure that sustainable transport methods are encouraged and implemented in accordance with Policies CS5 (Reducing the Need to Travel) and CS6 (Sustainable Travel) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, the cycle parking facilities as shown on the approved drawings shall be made available for use and shall thereafter be retained for use at all times. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be used for purposes falling within B1(b) (research and development)/B1(c) (light industrial use)/B2 (general industry) and B8 (storage and distribution) Use Classes only, and for no any other purpose as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instruction revoking and re-enacting that Order (with or without modification), without written consent from the Local Planning Authority first being obtained. \r\rReason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control of the type of use within the category in order to safeguard the amenities of the area in accordance with Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions)  and DM17 (Protecting Existing Employment Land and Premises) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Condition 1 (Car Club Membership Scheme) - Officers have reviewed the information provided and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 1 (Car Club Membership Scheme) of planning permission 19/02492/PNO is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to install a new window to replace garage door/high level window and installation of a new rooflight on rear facing roof. In this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposed changes are considered not to be non-material.",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependant on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. \r\rThe local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.",
    "The fee required for your planning application is £116.00, payment can be made via our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002 or by cheque made payeble to Royal Borough of Kingston.  Please ensure to quote your application number when making payment.",
    "Please confirm the description ''Change of use from bank (Use Class A2) to restaurant (Use Class A3), fenestration alteration. Repositioning of external air conditioning condensers and installation of kitchen ventilation system.''",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rThe submitted proposed block plan does not show the position of air condition and ventilation system."
