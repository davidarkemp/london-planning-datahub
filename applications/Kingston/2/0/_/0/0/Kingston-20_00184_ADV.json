The site is not located in a conversation area.\r\rThe application seeks to display 1no.x internally illuminated Fascia sign, 1no.x non illuminated Fascia sign and 1no. internally illuminated projecting sign.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the proposal on highway safety; and,\r\rAmenity \rThe proposed installation of replacement internally lit double sided advertisement sign by virtue of its sitting in a prominent position in the public highway and tall appearance would lead to an incongruous addition to the streetscene. This would be visually intrusive creating visual street clutter, detracting from the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPublic safety\rThe proposed advertisement display would be static. It would not obstruct any highway signs and would not impede the free flow of vehicle or pedestrian movement. The advertisement would not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety.\r\r\rIn conclusion the proposal would not accord with section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012."
