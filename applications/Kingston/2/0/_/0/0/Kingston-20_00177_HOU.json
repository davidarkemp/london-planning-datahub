    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a single storey side extension, a first floor side extension, a single storey rear extension and a front porch.\r\rThe application is a revision of refused application 21/00830/HOU.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- Car parking.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the proposed front porch, single storey side extension and single storey rear extension would appear as subordinate and proportionate additions to the dwelling. Their design would be in keeping with that of the existing building and they would not significantly disrupt the sense of symmetry with the adjoining semi-detached property. Officers consider that they would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe previous proposal for the site was refused because it would have resulted in the loss of the existing cat-slide roof and would have disrupted the symmetry with the adjoining semi-detached neighbour. In this revised application, the first floor side extension has been set back by approximately 750mm, such that the appearance of the cat-slide roof would be preserved. The proposed extension would not replicate the existing extension at the adjoining semi-detached neighbour, but because it would now be set back, the symmetry of the original facade would be maintained. Officers therefore consider that the proposed development would not have any material adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the scale and siting of the proposed extensions would be such that they would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light. The proposed windows at first floor level in the southern flank elevation may give rise to unacceptable views over neighbouring properties but this could be effectively mitigated by a condition requiring obscure glazing. The remaining windows would offer similar views to the existing.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe proposed development would result in the loss of one off-street car parking space (within the existing garage). This is considered to be an improvement on the existing situation, since the property currently benefits from four car parking spaces, which is above the maximum level of one space set by policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would reduce the number of off-street car parking spaces on the site, which would, in turn, help to promote sustainable modes of transport. This is a benefit which carries significant weight in favour of the proposal.\r\rThe impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area and on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable. This is a neutral matter.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rElevations need to be correctly titled as existing or proposed, if already built, this need to be titled as proposed and the pre-existing elevations titled as existing."
