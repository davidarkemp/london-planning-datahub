No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for  the demolition of a single storey rear extension and erection of a single storey rear extension. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r24/01749/CPU - Demolition of single storey rear extension and erection of single storey rear extension and hip to gable and rear dormer extension with 2nos  front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Refused 09.09.24\r5194/K - Conversion into flats. Refused 18.09.59\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the demolition of a single storey rear extensions  and erection of single storey rear extension.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension  would project a depth of  2.98and a width of 5.009mm. The proposed rear building line will be in alignment with the existing rear building line of neighbouring no 3 Osborne Road.   It would have a dual pitch aspect roof with  an eaves height of 2.64m and pitch height 4.023m. The rear elevation would present  bi folding doors and no fenestration is proposed on the side elevation. \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Application Site: \r\rThe application relates to an existing retail unit currently occupied by 'Pret A Manger' within the Kingston Railway Station building located to the north of Wood Street.  \r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Town Centre and is identified for significant improvements and redevelopment in the long-term (Proposal Site P10) under Policy K16 of the Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan K+20. \r\rThe site is not within a conservation area. The nearest listed buildings are the Bentall Shopping Centre located approximately 161m to the west of the site and the Regal Cinema located 60m north of the site. \r\rProposal: \r\rThe proposal is for the installation of proposed plant equipment at roof level and shopfront alterations for a new Sainsbury Supermarket within the retail unit. \r\rRelevant History: \r\r24/02810/ADV: Display of 2nos internally illuminated fascia signs and 2nos internally illuminated projection signs. Decision pending. \r\r17/12221/FUL: Alterations to shop front to facilitate the occupation of Pre A Manger. Granted 08.05.2017. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA total of 5 neighbours were consulted and no response was received. A site notice was displayed on site on 05.12.24. \r\rConsultees: \r\rThe Council's Environmental Health Officer has raised no objection. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Character and Design \r- Noise\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Design: \r\rParagraph 131 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2024) (NPPF) states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. London Plan 2021 (LP) Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Core Strategy 2012 (CS) Policy CS8 and DM10 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed shopfront alterations include a new automatic inward double door to replace the existing fixed glazing. The alterations are modest in scale and respectful of the character and appearance of the existing shopfront. The advertisement for the new tenant is subject to separate permission. The proposed plant equipment on the roof above the retail unit would be in a similar position to existing plant structures. The gas coolers would be located closest to the roof edge but would be screened by the parapet to protect the visual amenity of the public realm. Officers support the proposal on urban design grounds.  \r\rNoise: \r\rPara 198 of the NPPF confirms new development must mitigate and reduce impacts resulting from noise that may result in adverse impacts on health and the quality of life. This is echoed in LP Policy D14 and CS Policy DM10. \r\rA Noise Impact Assessment was submitted with the application. The nearest residential property is located opposite the site on the southern side of Wood Street, approximately 25m away. The report confirms the plant noise emissions would be compliant with the relevant British Standards. The Council's Environmental Health Officer has reviewed the report and is satisfied with its methodology and conclusions, subject to a condition being secured to restrict plant noise to be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level. \r\rFire Safety:\r\rLP Policy D12 requires all developments to achieve the highest standards of fire safety. A Fire Safety Statement and Fire Strategy Plan has been submitted. These documents demonstrate that fire safety measures would be acceptable and suitable means of escape and evacuation would be provided, in accordance with LP Policy D12. Officers find this to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion:\r\rThis application has been considered in the light of policies set out in the development plan and other material considerations. The proposed design of the development is considered acceptable and would not impact on the appearance of the street scene or the amenity of neighbouring occupants. In conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. Officers recommend planning permission be granted.",

All concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below. \r\r- Heritage & Conservation Officer: The new windows to the front and northern side elevation at ground floor do not align with the existing windows in terms of positioning, proportion and scale. Is it agreed there is more flexibility to the design of the fenestration to the rear, within a new elevation; however, the number of windows at ground floor mean that it is nearly all void, which diverges from the fenestration design of the existing house. The variety of window types also give it a messy appearance.\r\r- Tree and Landscape Officer: No Objection\r\r- Malden And Coombe CAAC: Fairlight, a notable building locally listed on Kingston Hill, has received well-thought-out and articulated proposals that are expected to improve both the building and the Conservation Area. The proposed new extension at the rear is sufficiently distanced to not affect the views from Richmond Park situated directly behind, warranting positive support. However 1) the front elevation new window should be lowered to match the cill height of the other windows; 2) the rear infill and the introduction of arched fenestration/door elements mismatch the remainder which are rectangular. Though they may not be visible generally we do consider this detracts from the unity and harmony of the rear elevation and the building's sensitive proposed alteration which is the overriding consideration.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing single-storey rear extension, erection of a two-storey rear, infill side porch extension. Two storey rear infill extension with balcony. Fenestration alterations. Works to the roof.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon the character, appearance and heritage assets;\r- The impact upon the residential amenity of neighbouring residents;\r- The Impact on trees.\r- The impact on biodiversity.\r- Fire Safety Assessment;\r\rCharacter, Design and Heritage.\rParagraph 131 of the NPPF (2023) sets out that: The creation of high quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) states development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\rParagraph 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The dwelling on site is a locally listed building within the Kingston Hill, Area of Archaeological Significance, the Kingston Hill Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. Along the rear boundary of the site sits the brick wall enclosing Richmond Park which Historic England designates as a Grade II listed building.\r\rThe special architectural and historic interest of Kingston Hill Conservation Area can be summarised as: A group of early Victorian through to early 20th century large houses in a woodland setting. Forming a wealthy suburb along the dramatic and well-landscaped historic strategic route of Kingston Hill, enjoying a close interrelationship with Richmond Park and strategic importance in longer views.\r\rThe applicant seeks advice on the erection of a two-storey rear extension, an infilling of the existing porch, works to the existing roof, alterations to the rear and side fenestration, the replacement of the coach house and a potential pool building within the rear garden.\r\rTwo-Storey Rear Extension\rThe proposed two-storey rear extension would be located toward the northern side of the dwelling and have a width of approximately 7.3m. Whilst officers acknowledge that the addition of this rear extension would involve the removal of the existing 3 pitched-roof dormers, the applicant proposes to construct a 3 dormer feature on the two-storey extension which would resemble the existing one, preserving the features of this locally listed building. Addtionally the two-storey extension would not be visible in the streetscene. \r\rSingle-storey Infill and Balcony\rThe proposed single-storey infill to the rear would be small in scale and would not extend past the two outriggers along both sides, it would also include glazing that would match the rest of the dwelling. On top of the infill extension is the proposed balcony feature, which would maintain reasonable obscurity from the view of neighbouring sites due to the dwelling's U-shaped layout and the proposed glazing would be a diminutive feature of the host dwelling. Like the proposed two-storey extension, the infill and balcony would also not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rFenestration\rThe applicant proposes to change the fenestration to the rear and a front window towards the northwestern end of the dwelling. Whilst officers acknowledge that the first-floor rear windows would not retain the existing, they would still appear elegant and respect the locally listed building. Reasonable Concerns were raised by the councils' Heritage Officer and Malden And Coombe CAAC regarding changes to the front fenestration, as a result, the applicant has amended the windows, to ensure that the window designs and reveals would match the existing windows. Additionally, the applicant has omitted the arched door/window feature to the rear and replaced it with a feature that closely resembles the rest of the ground-floor windows/doors.\r\rOther Concerns Raised\rOverdevelopment: Whilst officers acknowledge the concerns raised about the overdevelopment of the site, the site's layout and size give room for a two-storey rear extension as the site is large and as mentioned above the majority of the development would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rErosion of Gap: the proposed development would involve the demolition of a single-storey side extension which is closer to the northwestern boundary than the proposed two-storey rear extension. Whilst officers note that extension would be a bigger mass, it would still preserve that gap between neighbouring properties. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill Conservation Area.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies the same footprint as the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development does not occupy a significantly larger footprint than the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\rWhislt officers note the privacy concern, the proposed development would not cause any additional harm compared to the existing windows and doors on site. \r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees and Landscape\rParagraph 174 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by, among other things, recognising the benefits of trees and woodlands.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees there should be adequate replacement based on the existing value of the benefits of the trees removed, determined by, for example, i-tree or CAVAT or another appropriate valuation system. The planting of additional trees should generally be included in new developments - particularly large-canopied species which provide a wider range of benefits because of the larger surface area of their canopy.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected. Where trees are to be lost through development, the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: The site falls within Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character which, amongst other things, is notable for its high-quality public realm as a result of its mature and varied landscaping. It also falls within the Kingston Hill Conservation Area, borders Richmond Park Site of Special Scientific Interest and has Tree Preservation Orders associated with the site. \r\rThe Council's Tree & Landscape Officer has reviewed the Arboricultural Report and the supporting documents and raise no objection to the proposed development, as the tree removals consist mainly of category 'C' trees and will be replaced with more suitable species. \r\rBiodiversity\rSection 40 of the Natural Environment and Rural Communities Act 2006 places a duty on all public authorities in England and Wales to have regard, in the exercise of their functions, to the purpose of conserving biodiversity.\r\rPolicy G6 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process.\r\rPolicy DM6 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity as part of sustainable design, through the inclusion of sustainable drainage, tree planting, soft landscaping, habitat enhancement and/or improvement, green roofs and new or improved semi-natural habitats, where appropriate.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submittted details in regard to biodiversity enhancements and mitigation, in the event of an approval, this would be required along with the provision of at least 2 swift bricks. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement which does not sufficiently set out which policy criteria is not relevant to the development and why. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rRBK Trees and Landscape Officer -   Even though it is a small 3m extension, there are trees within the rear of the garden and particularly a very mature purple beech tree which could be affected by the proposal. Trees are shown on the proposed block plan, however no Arboricultural information  has been submitted and as such  unable to assess if any trees are to be affected.\r\rSurbiton CAAC - no objection. No adverse impact on the Conservation Area.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension. \r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises detached dwelling. \r\rThe application site is within a  Southborough Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building.  \r\rPlanning History\rThe site has been the subject of multiple planning and TPO decisions. The relevant planning history is set out below.\r\rDC/15/16586/HOU - Erection of side and rear single storey extension. Granted 15.09.15\rDC/014/16919/HOU - Erection of single storey side and rear extension. Granted 04.02.15\rDC 05/16168/FUL - Demolition of existing garage.Erection of single storey garage and pool house. Granted 19.05.05\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Impact on Trees\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension  would project a depth of 1.68m  and a width of 3.76m.  It would have a parapet flat roof with a height of 3.16m which would match in height with the existing  orangery.   The new rear elevation would present timber muntins to match original windows in the adjacent bay of the existing orangery. In respect of the proposed side elevation,  the proposed windows would comprise the existing casement windows. The proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\r\r\r\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 200 to 214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 205 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be), irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area.  The proposal would result in a small  increase in the footprint of the dwelling at  the rear. It is considered that there would be a small impact on the character of the plot layout. It is considered that the proposal would have a neutral impact on the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. \r\rImpact on Trees\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) states that the Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of  the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan (2021) states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained (Category A, B and lesser category trees where these are considered by the local planning authority to be of importance to amenity and biodiversity, as defined by BS 5837:2012).\r\rSouthborough Conservation Area originally formed part of the ground of Southborough Conservation Area originally formed part of the grounds of the Southborough Estate. Part of the special interest which contributes to the significance of the Conservation Area is the mature gardens, mature trees and extensive tree cover and greenery. \r\rThe Tree & Landscape Officer has reviewed the submitted application material. Within the rear garden,  the proposed block plan identifies a number of existing trees and RBK record identify a number to have TPOs including a particularly a very mature beech tree (Order:RBK.04.70 Ref: T7 Copper Beech (Fagus sylvatica 'Purpurea')  positioned to the rear of the garden. No arboricultural information has been submitted in support of the  application and therefore the Tree Officer is unable to fully assess the impact of the proposal on the trees within its vicinity. Should the Planning Officer be minded to approve the planning application, the Tree Officer  recommended a pre commencement  planning condition be included on the planning permission  requiring Tree Protection details  and if necessary a Arboricultural Method Statement  to be submitted and approved by the Local Planning Authority. However, in this instance, the applicant has not agreed to the pre commencement condition within the agreed timeframe. It therefore has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not cause any harm to health and longevity of the protected beech tree which is considered to be of amenity value.\r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a  Reasonable Exception Statement.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

    "The site comprises a ground-floor maisonette \r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r- 24/00983/FUL. Erection of a single storey rear extension,  relocation of entrance and associated internal works. Refused on 23.07.2024 for the following reason:\r\r1. By reason of height, depth and siting along the shared boundary, the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 10 Woodcote Close as it would lead to a significant loss of daylight to the closest ground floor window and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2023, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed single-storey rear extension would fall outside the guideline of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Desing SPD, as it would have a total depth of approximately 4m from the rear wall. However, the proposal would have a reasonable parapet roof height of approximately 3.2m, in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, the proposed extension would not be visible from the streetscene and would appear subordinate to the host dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rIt is noted that the construction of this rear extension would corner a section of the garden amenity which overall would appear odd, however as mentioned above the location of this proposal would be towards the rear therefore away from the view of the street scene. The applicant would also benefit from the remaining garden towards the rear.\r\rTherefore, on balance, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling which is joined to the neighbouring properties by the garages either side to the front of the properties. \r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing garage/store room and erection of part single storey side extension\r\rConsultation\r6 Neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Car/Cycle Parking; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed replacement side extension would be set in from the existing boundary resulting in a semi detached apperance. the new roof form would create a more cohesive appearance. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. The proposed development would result in the loss of possible storage for cycles within the existing garage and  access to the rear garden from the front of the property is not available. It has not been demonstrated how secure cycle parking could now be accommodated on site. However, it is considered that further information regarding this could be secured by condition.\r\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

This would be set back from the front elevation so would not be readily viewable within the streetscene. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the existing windows at ground floor level on the side elevation of No. 163 Elm road which serve a lounge/diner and is open plan so also avails of light from the rear window and door. The proposed side extension would be built to the boundary and have a pitched roof with eaves height of 2.4m. Due to the limited height and separation distance from the existing flank elevation of No. 163 Elm road, officers are satisfied the proposed development would not appear overbearing or result in detrimental loss of light. It would also not hamper any future extension from being built at No. 163 Elm Road. Overall, on balance, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.

However, the proposed outbuilding would be small in scale, would not be visible within the streetscene and would not be incongruous with the wider area, as neighbouring properties benefit from similar outbuildings.\r\rThe applicant has informed that the outbuilding would be used for purpose that is ancillary/incidental to the existing dwelling (summerhouse). In any case, a planning condition would secure this in the event of approval.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "Officer Report\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a first floor flat in a detached building located within the Wolverton Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal \rErection of rear piggyback roof extension.\r\rConsultations\r11 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the Heritage Assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed 'piggyback' roof extension would be set back approximately 4.9m from the front elevation and the proposed increase in ridge height would be approximately 1.28m, in accordance with Policy Guidance 40.\r\rDue to the narrow separation distances and the proposed design, the proposal is considered to appear as a subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rGiven the varied height of the adjoining properties, the proposal would appear in-keeping with the existing street scene. \r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 202 to 206 of the NPPF 2024 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 216 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Wolverton Avenue Local Area of Special Character  which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the conservation area area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Wolverton Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The adjoining property to the east of the application site, Wolverton House comprises a block of flats. As per available planning history for this site (application ref 23/01269/FUL) the windows in west elevation are non-habitable openings. As such, it is considered that the proposal due to its scale and siting would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property or appear as an overbearing when viewed from Wolverton House. \r\rWith regards to No 27 Coombe Road (converted into flats), the existing window in the second floor, east elevation due to its siting is considered to be non-habitable. As such, the proposal is considered not to result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to this property.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted drawings: F-01, F0-2 and F0-3 Fire Strategy which are considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
