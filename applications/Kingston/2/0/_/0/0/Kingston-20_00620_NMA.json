    "The applicant is informed that there are no accompanying drawings to indicate means of access for construction vehicles, suitability of the access in terms of width and location of material storage. These must be shown on a scale drawing with swept path (tracking) included if necessary. As it stands the submitted document lacks sufficient detail and simply references drawings submitted at the time of the substantive application which are not suitable for assessing construction access. The applicant should additionally provide details as to the type and frequency of vehicles accessing the site.\r\rThe applicant is advised to submit drawing(s) covering the aspects outlined above. Meanwhile Highways would object to Condition 8 of planning approval 19/02940/FUL being discharged.",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rThe submitted block plan does not have a scale bar.\r\r"
