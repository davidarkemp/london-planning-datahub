    "The site comprises a two-storey terraced dwelling with converted loft space that is located on the western side of George Road. A timber fence, approximately 1.8m in height, provides the boundary treatment between the application site and neighbouring property, No.39 George Road.  No.39 has a ground floor dining room window within close proximity of the boundary, which faces just to the south of due west. There is also a window and a door within the side elevation of the neighbouring property at ground floor level, which faces the boundary between the two dwellings. The application property is not listed, nor is it within a conservation area, and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity of the site.\r\r4x consultation letters were sent to neighbouring properties and no representations were received by the Council.\r  \rThe planning history relevant to this application is:\r16/14255/LDP- Erection of rear dormer roof extensions to main roof and rear roof and installation of 2 x front rooflights - GRANTED May 2016.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal involves the erection of a single storey infill extension to the rear of the property. It would infill a gap between a part single, part two-storey outrigger and the side boundary with no. 39 George Road. Due to the built up nature of the area, the extension would not be visible from any public viewpoint, and its scale and appearance would be in keeping with the original property.  Therefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal would increase the footprint of the property, thereby reducing the amount of outdoor amenity space at the property. However, it is considered that there would be ample space remaining for residents to enjoy and undertake their day-to-day activities. \r\rThe eaves height to the side of the proposed extension would be 2.2 metres at the boundary with No.39 and the depth would be approximately 4.8 metres. It is noted that there are windows to the rear/side of No.39 within close proximity of the boundary with No.41, however, it is considered that the proposed development would not have unacceptable adverse impacts upon neighbouring amenity. In addition, Officers note that the rear/side of No.39 is already somewhat restricted in terms of outlook and light as a result of the existing part single, part two-storey outrigger to the rear/side of no. 41 George Road. Therefore, the proposed extension, would cause no loss of daylight, loss of outlook, or increase in the sense of enclosure, to the rear/side of No. 39 George Road to an unacceptable degree and would be in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to have an acceptable impact upon the amenity of No. 39 George Road. The proposal would therefore be in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development was nonetheless established by the granting of 20/02037/HOU and Section 73(2) of the Act explicitly states that \"on such an application, the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which permission should be granted\". It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rOfficers are mindful of any changes in planning policy circumstances since the granting of the original permission, including the publication of the London Plan 2021. Officers have not identified any material changes in site circumstances over the same period.\r\rPrevious Relevant History:\rApplication reference 19/00700/HOU- Demolition of existing single storey rear extension and erection of single storey rear extension. Granted on 16th August 2019.\r\rApplication reference 20/02037/HOU - Erection of part single storey, part two storey rear extensions with associated changes to east elevation fenestration. Rear dormer roof extension with installation of 1no rooflight. Granted on 20th August 2020.\r\rApplication reference 21/00264/HOU - Erection of a single storey garden outbuilding for use as a play room/gym/home office. Refused on 28th January 2021.\r\rApplication reference 21/00553/NMA - Non-Material Amendment to Planning Permission ref: 20/02037/HOU (Erection of part single storey, part two storey rear extensions with associated changes to east elevation fenestration. Rear dormer roof extension with installation of 1no rooflight). Amendment to include alterations to side boundary fence and wall, timber decking with access to hot tub area. Refused on 22nd February 2021.\r\rApplication reference 21/00774/CLC - Details required for Condition 6 (Landscaping Scheme) of planning permission 20/02037/HOU (Erection of part single storey, part two storey rear extensions with associated changes to east elevation fenestration. Rear dormer roof extension with installation of 1no rooflight). Approved on 15th March 2021.\r\rConsultations:\r3no. representations from separate addresses have been submitted which raise the following summarised material considerations:\r - Inadequate landscaping and means of enclosure;\r - Inaccuracies in the Noise Report;\r - Siting of the heat pumps;\r - Loss of light to neighbouring window; and,\r - Impact upon privacy.\r\rStatutory, Non-Statutory and Internal Consultations: \rRBK Pollution Control Team: No objections, subject to the imposition of a condition relating to noise emittance to be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any time of operation, and a condition/informative to restrict hours of construction. \r\rSite and Surroundings:\rThe application relates to a two storey, detached dwelling on the southern side of Neville Avenue, New Malden. The land on the site falls from north-east to south-west.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and contains a Weeping Willow tree which is subject to a Tree Preservation Order (TPO). The site does not fall within a conservation area, although it is located opposite the boundary of Coombe House Conservation Area. None of the buildings on the site or within the immediate vicinity are statutory listed, or locally listed.\r\rProposal:\rPermission is sought to vary condition 1 (Approved Drawings) of planning permission reference 20/02037/HOU (Erection of part single storey, part two storey rear extensions with associated changes to east elevation fenestration. Rear dormer roof extension with installation of 1no rooflight) for changes to materials to boundary fence, installation of 3no. heat pumps and chimney flue.\r\rAssessment:\rThe variations to the approved plans include:\r - Alterations to the materials along the shared boundary fence with No.15 Neville Avenue, so that these consist of close-boarded fence panels rather than additional brickwork; \r - The addition of 3no. externally located heat pump units and acoustic enclosures; and,\r - The inclusion of a small chimney flue (for a gas fireplace) which has been added to the flat roof adjacent to the 1st floor extension. \r\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the resulting impact on character and appearance (including heritage assets) and residential amenity.\r\rImpact on Character and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset. \rThe proposed change to the boundary treatment along the section of shared boundary with No. 15 Neville Avenue to part brick wall / part close-boarded fencing is considered acceptable in design and appearance terms. The area of boundary treatment proposed to be impacted would be limited to between the built form of the application property and No. 15 and would have a very limited visual impact when viewed from the public realm.\r\rThe 3no. proposed heat pump units would be located to the rear elevation, two of which would be sited at ground level, adjacent to the terrace and one would be at roof level. All would be within acoustic enclosures. The design, size and siting of the heat pump units are considered to be appropriate for a domestic property. \r\rThe proposed chimney flue above the flat roof of the single-storey rear extension would abut the first floor rear extension and would be small in scale. \r\rIn terms of both general design terms in relation to the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and in terms of impact upon the non-designated heritage asset, the proposals are not considered to result in harm and are considered acceptable. \r\rResidential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed chimney flue is considered to be a minor addition of no material harm in terms of neighbouring amenity.\r\rThe proposed change to the boundary fencing on the shared boundary with No. 15 to now constitute part brick wall and the uppermost level to be close-boarded fencing is considered not to result in a materially adverse impact to No. 15 in terms of loss of privacy or loss of amenity, given that the height of this boundary as originally approved would be maintained. \r\rThe proposed 3no. heat pump units are supported by an independent acoustic report which has assessed the units in terms of the noise generation and potential impact to neighbouring amenity. Officers consider that the report has been carried out by a suitably qualified professional. The contents of the report have been assessed by Council's Environmental Health Officers who are satisfied with the methodology and recommendations of the acoustic report. Notwithstanding, a condition is recommended by Council's Environmental Health Officers regarding to the control/restriction of noise emissions to at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. This is considered reasonable to ensure that neighbouring amenity to both No. 15 and No.11 is protected. \r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed amendments to Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission reference 20/02037/HOU are considered not to have any adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity over and above that which was originally assessed and would be acceptable in character, design and appearance terms. There would be no harm to heritage assets. Therefore, the proposal is considered to comply with Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.\r",
