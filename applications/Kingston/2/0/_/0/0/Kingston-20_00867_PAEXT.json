    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed two storey side extension would in some aspects adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers consider that the hipped roof form of the proposed extension would not relate well to the existing gable end roof form of the host property. As such, it is considered that the proposed extension by reason of design and form would sit incongruously on the host property, and would detract from the appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proximity of the proposed development in relation to No. 90 and 92 Mount Pleasant Road, and that the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposal would not adversely impact the amenities of these neighbouring properties, officers consider that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light. \r\rHowever, given that no windows are proposed to the side elevation, officers consider that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. However, given that the existing hardstanding could accommodate 1 space for on-site parking, this would adhere to the policy requirements of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
