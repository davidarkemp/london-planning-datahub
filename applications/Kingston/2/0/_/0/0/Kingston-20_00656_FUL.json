    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate by the submission of sound evidence and rigorous marketing that a net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) on the site is justified and therefore the proposed development would not accord with Policy 4.4 of the London Plan 2016, Policy E4 of the Intended to Publish London Plan 2019 and Policy DM17 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide a robust justification to demonstrate that the level of affordable housing proposed is the maximum reasonable amount. As such, the development would not be in accordance with Policies 3.11, 3.12 and 3.13 of the London Plan 2016, Policy H4 of the Intended to Publish London Plan 2019 and DM15 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The applicants have only provided a preliminary specification for the development in relation to the level of carbon reduction that could be achieved, as such the applicant has not fully demonstrated that the development cannot reduce carbon / greenhouse gas emissions further. The development proposed would therefore not comply with policy 5.2 of the London Plan 2016 and SI 2 of the Intended to Publish London Plan 2019.",
    "The proposed development by virtue of it general massing, siting, layout and design would create an incongruous addition to the area that would fail to achieve a high quality of design and would cause harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would not accord with policies 7.4, 7.5 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016, D4, D5 and D6 of the Intended to Publish London Plan 2019, and CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy April 2012.",

In the absence of robust evidence demonstrating that the site / development is unsuited to the delivery of 30% of the proposed units as 3 bedrooms or more, or that it would not be viable to secure the delivery of 30% of the units as 3 bedrooms or more, the development would not accord with policy DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a 2 storey semi detached dwelling. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a first floor side roof extension, with side dormer and rear juliet balcony, the installation of 1x no front cabrio balcony roof window and 2 nos roof lights on top flat roof to facilitate a loft conversion.\r\rPlanning History\r22/01933/HOU- Erection of single-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration- REFUSED on 10.08.2022 for the following reason:-\rBy reason of its scale and depth, the proposed single storey rear extension, would adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring property at no. 248 Malden Way, by reason of an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no. 248 Malden Way. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r22/02922/HOU- Erection of single storey rear extension and relocation of shed- GRANTED 28.10.2022.\r\rConsultation\r6x properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side dormer roof extension has not been designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area, contrary to the recommendations set out in Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD. The scale, siting and design, of the proposed side dormer extension would not relate well to the character and appearance of the host property, streetscene and wider area and would appear as an incongruous addition. Thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the nature of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light The proposed side dormer would not cause increased overlooking or loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, significant enough to warrant refusal. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through condition.\r\rConclusion\rBy reason scale, siting and design, the proposed side dormer extension would not relate well to the character and appearance of the host property, streetscene and wider area and would appear as an incongruous addition. Thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The applicant is informed that Planning Condition 4 (Construction Management Plan) of planning permission 22/01547/FU )is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house which Historic Maps from 1953 and Historic Aerial Photography from 1946 and 1949 show the two-storey outrigger to be original, but no single storey rear extension is evident. It is also noted that there are Building Control records dating to 1989 and 1999 for single storey rear extensions. On the balance of probability, and in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, Officers consider the proposed extension would therefore extend beyond a rear wall of the original dwellinghouse by more than 6 metres, extend beyond an original side elevation of the original dwellinghouse and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse and the enlarged part together with any existing enlargement of the original dwellinghouse to which it will be joined would exceed the limits set out in sub-paragraphs (e) to (j) in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (g) (i), (j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey ground floor rear extension\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would exceed the recommended depths for single storey rear extensions as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD, officers do not consider that the proposal would be visually disproportionate given existing surrounding development and that it would be situated to the rear. The proposed development is therefore considered visually acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design. It is not considered that there would be any unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal would fail the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest habitable room window at No. 3 Queen's Road. However, officers acknowledge that this window is already deprived of light by the presence of extensions to either side of it at the ground and first floo levels. \r\rNevertheless, the proposed extension would be particularly tall and deep (approximately 6.2m), and it would be sited hard up against the shared boundary. On this basis, it is considered that the proposed development would be unneighbourly and would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No. 3 by reason of overbearing impact, a sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: No Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
