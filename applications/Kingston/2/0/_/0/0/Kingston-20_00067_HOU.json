    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development shall be completed in accordance with the following details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, prior to above ground works and thereafter permanently retained\r\r(a)\tmaterials for all external finishes of the single storey rear extension (including their manufacturer(s) specification, colour and texture). \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the north-east or south-west elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the north-east or south-west elevation of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "If you have evidence to contradict the local planning authority's assessment of the application, you are encouraged to apply for the development again and include that evidence in support of the application.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that planning permission for similar extensions was granted as part of application 19/02109/HOU.\r\rThe proposal in this case would effectively create an additional storey to the original dwelling, remodelling its design. While the proposed extension is considered substantial, officers note that the dwellings on Moresby Avenue are predominantly two storey dwellings, and as such the proposed development would not appear out of character within the area. Similarly, the front facade, proposed roof form, and proposed materials would architecturally be in keeping with the surrounding buildings, as well as the original features of the host property. As such it is considered that the proposed development would respect the character and appearance of the original building as well as the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would include the conversion of the existing attached garage into habitable space, and while the proposed height would exceed the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD for single storey side extensions, officers note that the roof form would be in keeping with the original dwelling and the proposed changes to the front elevation would be minimal. As such, officers consider that the proposed development would not detract from the original building or the character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, but would have a modest height and as such would appear a subordinate addition to the dwelling. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact to the character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest eaves height, and proximity of the proposed single storey rear extension in relation to neighbouring properties, officers consider that the proposed development would not impact the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rOfficers note that while the proposed development at ground floor level would not extend closer to the shared boundary with No. 57 Moresby Avenue, the proposal would result in an additional storey at first floor level. The proposed first floor extension would have the same eaves height as the existing side dormer roof extensions and would extend approx 0.24m closer to the shared boundary. Given the above, officers consider that the first floor extensions would not materially impact on light, or be overbearing in relation to the ground floor window at No. 57 Moresby Avenue. \r\rFurther, given the separation distance of the extensions at first floor level with No. 59 Moresby Avenue, and the fact that the extensions at first floor level would respect the footprint of the original dwelling at ground floor level, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 59 Moresby Avenues of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe proposal would include windows at first floor level on both the north-eastern and south western elevations, which could result in loss of privacy and overlooking. However, it is considered that this issue could be resolved by an appropriate condition to ensure that these windows are obscure-glazed condition and non-openable at 1.7m above first floor level, in the event of an approval. Subject to compliance with this condition, the proposed development is considered not to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal seeks to convert the existing garage into habitable space officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of existing on-site parking provision as the internal measurements of the existing garage do not conform with the parameters set by the Sustainable Transport SPD. Despite the fact that the proposed development would not result in any loss or gain of off-street parking on site, the existing on-site provision (1 space) would accord with London Plan standards.\r\rOfficers note that the application site would retain side access to the rear garden of the property and this would facilitate the accommodation of on-site, secure cycle parking in accordance with the standards set out in Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
