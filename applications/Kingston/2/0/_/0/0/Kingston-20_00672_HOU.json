    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Introduction\rThe site comprises a detached single storey bungalow situated to the rear of No. 414 and No. 416 Leatherhead Road, with access gained between these two properties.\r\rNeighbour Consultation\r3 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposals and 2 representations have been received, highlighting the following summarised material concerns:-\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use;\r- Excessive height and bulk of buildings;\r- The proposed extension is on greenbelt land and the granting of planning permission for this extension would damage the environment;\r- Building on this land diminishes the \"refuge for wildlife\" diminishes;\r- Further planning permission would mean \"further upset for the inhabitants of the lush surroundings.\";\r- Malden Rushett is built on a flood plain, any further building would \"exacerbate this problem.\"; and,\r- Further development would be unsustainable.\r\rOfficer comment:-  The site is located within the Green Belt.  The proposed development would be located on exisiting residential garden land. The site is not within a conservation area and the host building is not listed, or locally listed. There are no protected trees on site, or adjacent to the site and no specific wildlife or nature designations apply to the site. According to the Government's Flood Map for Planning, the application site is in Flood Zone 1 (low probability of flooding). Other issues highlighted in the neighbouring representations are discussed in the \"Design of the Proposal and the Impact on the Green Belt\" section below.\r\rPlanning History\r14/10388/OUT- Outline application to erect 2 x semi-detached chalet bungalows on land to the rear of 414 Leatherhead Road. Refused January 2015, for the following reasons:-\r\r1. The proposed development is located in the Green Belt outside any identified settlement area and represents inappropriate development which is by definition harmful to the Green Belt and would have a detrimental impact on the openness of the Green Belt. The proposal would fail to accord with the fundamental aim of Green Belt policy to preserve the openness of the Green Belt and would conflict with the purposes of including land in Green Belt. Therefore the proposal is deemed to be contrary to the Policies CS3 and DM5 of the LDF Core Strategy and guidance contained in the National Planning Policy Framework.\r\r2. The proposal would not conform with the pattern or character of residential development in the area contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy, Adopted in April 2012 and Policy Guidance 24 of the Residential Design Guidance Supplementary Planning Document, Adopted July 2013.\r\r15/10106/OUT- Outline application to erect a detached bungalow on land to rear to consider Access and Layout. Granted July 2015.\r\r18/10257/REM- Reserved Matters Application seeking approval for matters relating to appearance, landscaping and scale of the proposed development approved under Outline Planning Permission 15/10106/OUT. Granted September 2018.\r\r18/00139/COND- Details required by Condition 2 (Means of Enclosure) of planning permission 18/10257/REM (Reserved Matters Application seeking approval for matters relating to appearance, landscaping and scale of the proposed development approved under Outline Planning Permission 15/10106/OUT). Granted October 2019.\r\rOfficer Comment:- Following the discharge of Condition 2 (Means of Enclosure) of planning permission 18/10257/REM with approval of details application18/00139/COND, all conditions attached to outline planning permission 15/10106/OUT and Reserved Matters permission 18/10257/REM, that need to be discharged by the Council, have been discharged.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on Green Belt land; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rThe Design of the Proposal and the Impact on the Green Belt National Planning Policy Framework 2021\rInappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances. It is stated in paragraph 148 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2021, that when considering any planning application, local planning authorities should ensure that substantial weight is given to any harm to the Green Belt. 'Very special circumstances' will not exist unless the potential harm to the Green Belt by reason of inappropriateness, and any other harm resulting from the proposal, is clearly outweighed by other considerations\". Section 149 of the NPPF 2021, goes on to state that a local planning authority should regard the construction of new buildings as inappropriate in the Green Belt. Included in the exceptions to this is are:\ra) buildings for agriculture and forestry;\rb) the provision of appropriate facilities (in connection with the existing use of land or a change of use) for outdoor sport, outdoor recreation, cemeteries and burial grounds and allotments; as long as the facilities preserve the openness of the Green Belt and do not conflict with the purposes of including land within it;\rc) the extension or alteration of a building provided that it does not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building;\rd) the replacement of a building, provided the new building is in the same use and not materially larger than the one it replaces;\re) limited infilling in villages;\rf) limited affordable housing for local community needs under policies set out in the development plan (including policies for rural exception sites);\rg) limited infilling or the partial or complete redevelopment of previously developed land, wheter redundant or in continuing use (excluding temporary buildings), which would; not have a greater impact on the openness of the Green Belt than the existing development; or not cause substantial harm to the openness of the Green Belt, where the development would re-use previously developed land and contribute to meeting an identified affordable housing need within the area of the local planning authority.\r\rLondon Plan (2021)\rPolicy G2 London's Green Belt states:\rThe Green Belt should be protected from inappropriate development: development proposals that would harm the Green Belt should be refused except where very special circumstances exist.\r\rKingston-upon-Thames Core Strategy (2012)\rPolicy CS 3 \"The Natural and Green Environment\": The Council will protect and improve Kingston's valued natural and green environment by protecting Kingston's open space network from inappropriate development through its open spaces designations; Green Belt.\r\rPolicy DM 5 \"Green Belt, Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and Open Space Needs\" states that the Council will ensure that development proposals do not harm open spaces which:\ri. contribute to the character, appearance and heritage value of the Borough's open space network\rii. create focal points and valuable amenity space within the built up area\riii. form part of an area of value for wildlife, sport or recreation.\r\rPolicy DM 10 \"Design Requirements for New Developments (including House Extensions)\"\rDevelopment proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following:\ra. prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\rb. prevailing density of the surrounding area\rc. scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms), massing\rd. landscape setting and features\re. plot width and format which includes spaces between buildings\rf. building line build up, set back and front boundary\rg. typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges etc.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed extension would only project 4.0 metres beyond the furthest-most rear building line of the existing dwelling and its height (3.5 metres) would not exceed the height of the existing property. The design, materials and roof form would be in keeping. In terms of additional floorspace it would be modest and constitute less than a 30% increase. Furthermore, the proposed extension would be located to the rear of the dwelling, on exisiting garden land, on a site which is set well back from the neighbouring properties on Leatherhead Road and would be screened by mature trees to the south. It would not be clearly visible from the highway. Taking these considerations into account, it is considered that the proposed extension would not result in a disproportionate addition, over and above the size of the original building and there would be no significant adverse impacts on the openness of the Green Belt, or the character or appearance of the area, as a result of the proposed development. Therefore, the proposal is considered to be an exception under part C, of paragraph 149 of the NPPF 2021 and would comply with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe Impact of the Development on the Neighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the siting and scale of the proposed extension and the mature trees forming the shared boundary the south the proposed extension would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of No.416 Leatherhead Road, or any other neighbouring properties, by reason of a loss of privacy, increased overlooking, or overbearing appearance, or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
