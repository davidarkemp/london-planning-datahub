    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side and front porch wraparound extension would not strictly accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, it would have a modest height and have a roof form that is in keeping with the host property, as such the proposed single storey side and front wraparound would appear an appropriate addition to the host property. Similarly, officers note that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate surrounding area, and as such the proposed development would not appear out of keeping with the character and appearance of the area. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would also not strictly accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, but given the modest eaves height, it would appear a subordinate addition to the host property.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would come closer to the shared boundaries, given the modest eaves height of the proposed development, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevations, there would be no adverse impact to the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light/sunlight or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
