    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the ground floor side (south) window serving the room labelled as 'Family' and the first floor rear window serving the room labelled as 'Bathroom' on the approved drawings shall be: \ri) obscure-glazed to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale; and \rii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.\r\rAny film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The flat roof on the ground floor extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The proposed rear extension would include an area of raised decking which would not comply with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (k) (i) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) it will consist of or include (i) the construction or provision of a verandah, balcony or raised platform.",
    "Paragraph A.4 - (7) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) states that \"Where any owner or occupier of any adjoining premises objects to the proposed development, the prior approval of the local planning authority is required as to the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of any adjoining premises\".\r\r1 letter of objection has been received from an adjoining neighbour raising concerns regarding impact on amenity. Therefore the Council is permitted to assess the proposals as per Paragraph A.4 - (7) of Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe proposed development, due to the existing situation, would not result in an unacceptable loss of light to either neighbouring property as it complies with BRE guidance in relation to the 45 degree rule regarding loss of daylight/sunlight.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to achieve an acceptable relationship with the original property in terms of bulk, scale and mass and would not be clearly visible from the street scene. However, the use of dark brick is considered completely inappropriate and would be out of keeping with not only the original property, but neighbouring properties in the immediate surrounding area also which all have white render. Although the proposed materials would not warrant a reason for refusal in and of themselves, further details would be requested via condition (in the event of an approval) to ensure that the walls were finished in materials to match the existing. Therefore, overall and subject to the satisfaction of a materials condition, it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to be considered in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 38 & No. 42 George Road. The proposed extension would be particularly deep in relation to the original rear elevation of the application property (ranging between approximately 3m and 5.79m), and it would be sited hard up against the shared boundary with both No. 38 and No. 42 George Road, conlficting with the recommended depths set out in Policy 33 of the Residential Design SPD. It has not been demonstrated that the proposed devlopment would comply with BRE guidelines in terms of daylight/sunlight. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would be unneighbourly and would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No. 42 Northcote Road, as it would create an undue sense of enclosure to the window of the nearest ground floor habitable room and unacceptably limit its outlook. As such the proposed development would conflict with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth (4m v. 3-3.5m), officers note that it would have a modest height and as such would not appear a disproportionate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest height, and separation distance between the proposed development and habitable windows of neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
