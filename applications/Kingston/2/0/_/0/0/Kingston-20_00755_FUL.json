    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of a first floor front and side extensions including ground floor front lobby extension with canopy and associated changes to the fenestration.\r\r34x properties were notified of the proposal. One objection has been received, which highlights the following concerns:-\r\"The proposed first floor extension (and associated new roof) that builds over the existing garage and kitchen right to the boundary line between the two properties will decrease the light and sunlight that flows into the garden and through the ground floor window at no.19. It will reduce the privacy of no.19 - both of the garden and the home. It is building right to the boundary line that brings no.17 significantly closer to no.19 and blocks a great deal of light that currently flows through to no.19.\rSpecific areas Loss of light/sunlight - effect on no.19 Manorgate Road\r\rThe proposed first floor extension will block the light and sunlight that flows into the garden of no.19. This is especially true for the garden area that runs down the side of no.19 and between the two houses. This is used as a play area for children.\rThe first floor extension will reduce the light and sunlight that flows through the ground floor window on the side of no.19 (facing the side of no. 17). This window lights up the ground floor dining and kitchen area in no.19. Privacy - reduced privacy to no.19 Manorgate Road.\r\rThe proposed first floor extension will greatly impact the privacy of the garden at no.19. Building right to the boundary line brings the first floor of no.17 significantly closer to no.19. A proposed new first floor bathroom (to be built above the existing kitchen) will overlook the garden of no. 19 from an elevated position, reducing privacy.\r\rA further proposed first floor bathroom will have a window to the side of no.17 that will overlook the garden of no.19. Even if frosted, whenever it is open this window will have a line of sight into the garden of no.19. This is especially true for the garden area that runs down the side of no.19 and between the two houses. This is used as a play area for children. The proposed first floor extension will greatly impact the privacy of the ground floor dining and kitchen area in no.19. Building right to the boundary line brings no.17 significantly closer to no.19. Even if frosted, whenever it is open the proposed first floor bathroom window to the side of no.17 will have a line of sight into the ground floor window on the side of no.19. This window lights up the ground floor dining and kitchen area in no.19.\"\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor front and side extension, would not be set behind the existing gable ended projection to the front of the main house and the roof height of the proposed first floor front and side extension, would be higher than that of the existing host property. The proposal includes an irregular roof profile running along the side boundary shared with No. 19, which goes beyond the natural hip of the roof. No details of rainwater goods within the site boundary are given. The proposed first floor side extension would not be set in from the shared side boundary between no. 19 and no.17 Manorgate Road, which would not conform to the relevant guideline of one metre within the Residential Design SPD. The proposed development would not appear subordinate to the main dwellinghouse and it would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling by eroding gaps between neighbouring properties. The proposed development, as a result of the height, overall design, bulk, massing and proximity to the neighbouring property at no. 19 Manorgate Road, would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene and surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor extension would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD as mentioned above, the applicant has agreed to obscure glaze and fix shut a first floor side bathroom window, which would face no.19.The introduction of a rear roof dormer,  along with the first floor side bathroom window, would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties, by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rThe height and proximity, of the proposed first floor side extension would not cause an  increase in the sense of enclosure and overbearing impact to the side  of no. 19 Manorgate Road and this loss of amenities to this  neighbouring property, have been taken into account iwhen refusing this application.\r\rThe applicant has failed to provide a photograph of the  side facing, kitchen/dining room window at no. 19 Manorgate Road, taken from the host property. However, officers have been able to assess from the drawings and photographs provided, that the  proposed development would cause a loss of daylight to a side facing, kitchen/dining room window at no. 19 Manorgate Road and the rear garden area to this neighbouring property. However, this flank window at ground floor level, is positioned towards the rear of this neighbouring property, faces West and sunlight is already partly blocked by the existing host property from the rear garden area and the flank window at ground floor level. In addition, the submitted plans at first floor level have been amended by the applicant to set back the rear wall of the proposed side extension to be in line with adjoining building rear wall of the dwellinghouse at no.19. It is considered therefore, that the loss of daylight caused to no. 19 Manorgate Road, by the proposed development, would not be significant enough to warrant refusal.\r\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. The proposal would convert the existing garage into storage space. Officers consider that a condition could be added to a future planning permission, if it were granted, for cycle space provision, in this area.\r\rThe hardstanding to the front of the property would continue to accommodate 2, or more, off-street car parking space which would accord with London Plan standards.\r\rIn conclusion, by reason of its height, overall design, bulk, massing and proximity to the shared boundary with no. 19 Manorgate Road, the proposed first floor side extension would appear as a dominant and incongruous addition to the original dwelling, which would erode an existing gap between two properties in Manorgate Road and would be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate streetscene. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the Kingston Council Residential Design SPD1.\r",
