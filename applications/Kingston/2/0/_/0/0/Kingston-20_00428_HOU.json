    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the south-eastern or north-western elevations of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the south-eastern elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections from 2 separate households have been received relating to:  \r\r-Concerns the dwelling would be used as a HMO;\r-Car parking issues;\r-Inappropriate design/layout; and,\r-Excessive height or bulk of buildings.\r\rConcerns relating to a possible use of the extended dwelling as a HMO is not relevant to the assessment of this application. Any change to a small HMO would fall within the parameters of permitted development. Any change to a large HMO would require planning permission. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of proximity to the boundary line, officers note that the site occupies a corner plot postition and it would have a modest footprint and height. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original building or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed first floor side extension would also not strictly comply with requirements of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the shared boundary or set down from the ridge of the original roofslope. However, it would have an appropriate roof form and as stated above, given the corner plot location it would appear an appropriate addition to the host property. Furthermore, as similar extensions are viewed on the Raleigh Drive streetscene, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed front porch extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of proximity to the front bay window. However, it would have an appropriate depth and height, and as such it is considered appropriate and that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original building or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed rear dormer extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given proximity of the proposed extensions in relation to the adjoining property, and that there is no immediate neighbouring property to the south of the dwelling, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. The hardstanding to the front of the property would accommodate 2 car parking spaces.  Whilst this would be in excess of the standards set out in the London Plan, this would not warrant grounds for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rLondon Plan Policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage and there is no external access the rear of the property, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that cycle parking is provided in the event of an approval.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the Act) allows a non-material amendment to be made to an existing planning permission via a simple application procedure with a quick decision time. \r\rSection 96A of the Act states that \"A local planning authority in England may make a change to any planning permission relating to land in their area if they are satisfied that the change is not material.\"\r\rIn deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe power conferred by Section 96A would allow the Council:\r\r(a)\tto impose new conditions; \r(b)\tto remove or alter existing conditions.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance  provides guidance on non-material amendments.\r\rThe NPPG directs \"There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another.\" \r\rThe focus of the assessment of an application for a non-material amendment is whether the proposed amendment, taken individually or cumulatively with any other previously approved non-material amendment, and in the context or the previously approved development, is non-material or not.\r\rAs identified in the NPPG the assessment of whether a proposed amendment is non-material will in part be dependent on the context of the overall scheme and the location in which the development is situated. Indeed, an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another.\r\rThe proposed amendment in the form of an extra enclosure measuring 650 x 1600 x 1500) is considered to be non-material subject to the additional planning conditions.\r\r\r\r\r\r",
