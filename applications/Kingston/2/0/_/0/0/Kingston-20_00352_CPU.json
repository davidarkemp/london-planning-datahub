    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and the installation of 2 no. rooflights to the front roof slope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey end of terrace dwellinghouse located on Archdale Place. \r\rConsultations\rThree neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Note: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Note: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that to manage car use to ensure sustainability, road safety and reduce congestion the Council will implement traffic management measures to ensure highway safety, improve residential amenity and smooth traffic flow. In addition the Council will manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenity. In addition, Policy DM9 of the Core Strategy states that new development must comply with local car parking standards to ensure that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. Furthermore paragraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal involves the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable room.  Officers note that properties on Archdale Place benefit from either an integral garage, or a designated parking space. The proposed development in this case would involve the removal of the only parking space designated for the application site, i.e. it does not benefit from any alternative off-site parking bay. The highway in front of the application site is used to access allocated parking spaces for other residential units on Archdale Place and therefore parking on the road outside the application property would not be supported. Furthermore,  there is limited on street parking availability in the immediate vicinity. The applicant has not put forward any details as to how car parking provision for the application site would be accommodated. Therefore, the proposed conversion of a garage in this case is considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact on congestion and highway safety, through the loss of designated off-street parking. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), and Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) due to the unacceptable impact the proposed conversion of a garage would have on congestion and highway safety.",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rWe received two sets of proposed elevations, one set of proposed elevation does not show any part of the main house. Another sets of proposed elevations show changes in first floor, loft conversion with dormer. If this proposal does not include any alteration to first floor or loft or any other part the main house, please do not show any changes in the main house in proposed elevations. Please show those alteration in proposed elevation which is relevant to this application only. \rWe require the existing and proposed elevations of whole building including main house, spa gym and swimming pool. The description in the submitted application form is ''Erection of single-storey rear/side extension to spa and gym. Renovation of existing swimming pool and associated changes to fenestration.'' \rAlternatively please amend the description and documents to clarify the loft conversion and first floor alteration.\r"
