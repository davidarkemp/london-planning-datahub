    "The proposed extension and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015",
    "Site\rThe application site is an end of terrace dwellinghouse located on Poplar Grove. The site is located within the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character (LASC)-a non-designated heritage asset. \r\rConsultations\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation was received OBJECTING to the application on the following summarised grounds:\r- Inappropriate design/layout; and,\r- Loss of light/sunlight.\r\rThese are material uplanning considerations and will be assessed below:\rConsideration\r-The key areas of assessment are: \r-The impact of the development on character and appearance;\r-The impact of the development on heritage assets; \r-The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r-The impact of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey side extension. Officers consider this to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure approximately 5.8 metres in depth from the rear wall of the existing dwellinghouse. This extension would have a parapet-flat roof and would measure a maximum of 3.2 metres in height. Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth, however, if the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased. Furthermore, extensions with a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height. Both neighbouring properties have been extended to the rear at ground floor level, and as such the proposed single storey rear extension in this case would be in general accordance with the Residential Design SPD 2013 and would be in keeping with the existing dwelling house and the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate surrounding area.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficers Comments: As stated above the Lime Grove LASC constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. Amongst other aspects, it is characterised by richly detailed terrace houses with typical Edwardian detailing including red brick, roughcast render and Tudor detailed gables. As also stated above the proposed extensions are considered to be in-keeping with the existing dwelling house and the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate surrounding area. Therefore, it follows that Officers consider that the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of the Lime Grove LASC.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider are Nos. 39A (ground floor flat) and 43 Poplar Grove. \r\rThe neighbouring property at No. 39A Poplar Grove has an existing single storey projection, which extends further in depth than the proposed single storey rear extension. As such any windows on the rear elevation of this extension would not adversely impact this neighbour in terms of overlooking or loss of privacy. Officers do note the existence of three ground floor windows within an indented area in close proximity to the proposed side extension. Two of these three windows relate to a bathroom and kitchen, both of which are not habitable rooms. The third is understood to relate to a bedroom. Whilst Officers accept that the proposed development would result in some loss of light to these rooms, it is considered that this would not be materially greater than the existing situation and would not warrant grounds for refusal. \r\rTo the rear of No. 43 Poplar Grove is a single storey rear extension which facilitates a bathroom. As this is not a habitable room, any loss of light would not warrant a refusal. \r\rAs no windows are proposed on the flank walls of the extension officers consider that the proposed development would not lead to any loss of privac to the neighbouring properties. \r\rOverall, it is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy to an unaccetpable degree.\r\rHighways and transportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the application site does not benefit from any off-street car parking provision and there are no changes proposed in this regard. Due to the loss of the side access to the rear of the property and easy access to the rear garden, as well as an absence of secure cycle parking details within the submitted plans, the applicant has failed to demonstrate compliance with the cycle parking standards set out in the London Plan. Notwithstanding and in the event of an approval, it is considered that these details could be secured via condition. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please be advised we are only in receipt of the proposed floor plan and roof plan. Existing and Proposed plans are required, showing elevations also."
