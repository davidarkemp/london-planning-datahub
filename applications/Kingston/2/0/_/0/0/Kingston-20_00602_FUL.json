    "The proposal would constitute inappropriate development on Metropolitan Open Land which, by definition, is harmful. Sufficient 'very special circumstances' do not exist in this case to clearly outweigh the actual and defined harm to the Metropolitan Open Land. The proposal is therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 7.17 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM 5 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By virtue of its size, scale and design, the proposed development would cause harm to character and appearance of the  surrounding area, failing to integrate with the host building and resulting in an adverse impact on the setting of the Golf Clubhouse which is a locally listed building. The proposal is  therefore contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS 8, DM 10 and DM 12 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.",
    "Where reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.",
    "Please confirm description of works as the application form description does not correspond with the proposed works in the plans and/or supporting documents.  Confirmation can be in writing or by amending the plans to reflect the proposals.\r\rNote: Any documentation with the incorrect proposals will need to be resubmitted, this includes the description of works section on the application form."
