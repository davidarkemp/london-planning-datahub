With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r30 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rPollution Cntrol Team - 24.02.2022\r\rCondition - Construction Hours \r\rThe site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenity of the neighbours by minimising impacts of the development that would otherwise give rise to nuisance.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee 12.04.2022\r\rNo objection. \rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe principle of development\rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \r\rPolicy DM17 states that the Council will protect, manage and enhance all employment land and premises in local centres so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods, services and employment. \r\rPolicy DM18 states that the Council will consider applications for new employment development (of an appropriate scale) in designated employment locations favourably. \r\rOfficer comment: The proposal would replace an existing ground floor unit of 114 Ewell Road. Officers note that the premises at 114-116 was granted permission for a part gymnasium (Class D2), part restaurant (Class A3). Both of these approved uses would now currently fall under Class E, however it is unclear whether this permission was ever implemented. \r\rNo. 114 Ewell has been vacant for a number of years, with evidence of its last implemented use being a restaurant (Class E) in 2009. Since it has not been demonstrated that another use has operated continuously for a period of more than 10 years, officers consider it likely that the application site does fall under an E Use Class. \r\rOfficers note that the proposal would provide a nail and beauty salon, which would fall under Class Sui Generis Use. Whilst there appear to be a few similar uses within Ewell Road Local Centre, officers note that it would not lead to a predominance of Sui Generis Use Classes within Ewell Road, and given that there are a number of vacant premises within the immediate vicinity, officers consider that the proposed use would be an appropriate use within the designated local centre. Further, by bringing a vacant unit back into use it would enhance the vitality and viability of Ewell Road, providing employment floorspace and employment opportunities.\r\rOfficers note that the proposal does not seek any changes to the shopfront. Any changes in this regard may require a separate planning permission and advertisement consent.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposals would not involve any external alterations to the shopfront, and as such there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the property, or the immediate surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The applicant has specified the opening times of the proposed nail salon. Due to its commercial nature, officers consider it appropriate to limit the opening hours to 0900 - 1900 Mon - Sat and 1100 - 1800 on Sundays and Bank Holidays. Given that the proposed use would not likely generate additional noise than a retail shop, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of increased noise and disturbance.\r\rFurther, given that the floorspace of the building would remain the same, with no changes to the shopfront, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within the Controlled Parking Zone, and the site is located within a PTAL Zone 4. \r\rOfficers note that no car parking for staff or customers is proposed, however given that the site is located within PTAL Zone 4 officers consider the lack of car parking provision to be acceptable.\r\rThe London Plan would require a commercial space of this nature to provide 1 long stay cycle parking space and 1 short stay cycle parking space, and while the applicant has not provided details of the proposed cycle storage, officers consider that this could be secured via an appropriate condition in the event of an approval to ensure policy compliance.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. \r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Oakhill Conservation Area is a designated heritage asset. The special architectural and historic interest of the Oakhill Conservation Area area can be summarised as: A Regency and early Victorian linear housing development made up of two separate areas Oakhill Conservation Area (A) which runs along the old turnpike road of Ewell Road and Oakhill Conservation Area (B) which is made up of five large properties in Langley Road. The area around Ewell Road was later converted to a commercial centre, together with an area of substantial Victorian houses and The Wood open space to the west.\r\rAs the proposed development would not alter the frontage of the structure, and would not result in a loss of historic fabric internally, whilst also bringing a currently vacant unit into use, Officers consider that the proposed development would not harm the cultural significance of the Oakhill Conservation Area, and would be of public benefit. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe application site concerns No. 7 Green End, Chessington, a two-storey detached dwellinghouse situated on the north-east side of Green End, a cul-de-sac accessed off Hook Road to the west. Approximately 40m to the west of the site is Grade II listed 325 Hook Road (a.k.a Orchard Court). The application site shares a rear boundary with Rosemary Gardens to the north-east.\r\rThe site is covered by an area Tree Preservation Order (TPO) with a notable Category A Walnut Tree within the rear garden. Approximately 35m to the west of the application site is Grade II listed Orchard Court (No. 325 Hook Road). The listing for Orchard Court states that it is an early-mid 19th century house; the significance of the heritage asset is derived from its architectural interest.\r \rProposal\rErection of single storey detached out-building for garage, gym and shed and  new dropped kerb crossover to Rosemary Gardens\r \rConsultation\rTree Officer: No objection in principle subject to planning conditions and replacement tree planting of a high quality being secured.\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: It has not been demonstrated that sufficient visibility splays would be provided so as to ensure pedestrian and highway safety.\r\rNeighbour Notifications\r3 letters of representation have been received, of which 2 were letters of objection raising the following summarised comments:\r- The proposed vehicular access will reduce on-street car parking for Rosemary Gardens residents;\r- Insufficient set-back of the garage from the pavement which will pose a highway safety risk, especially to pedestrians;\r- Increase in traffic;\r- Excessive height;\r- The trees to be removed should be replaced with new trees.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Character & Design\r- Neighbouring Amenities\r- Trees\r- Highway Safety\r \rCharacter, Design & Impact on Heritage Assets\rSection 66(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act, 1990 (as amended) requires the Local Planning Authority to pay special regard to the desirability of preserving the listed buildings and their settings or any features of special architectural or historic interest which such building may possess. This statutory duty is considered alongside national policies in the NPPF 2021, the complementary NPPG and regional and local policies.\r \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. Policy DM12 states that the Council will ensure that development proposals either preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting.\r\rPolicy Guidance 41 (Outbuildings) of the Residential Design SPD (2013) sets out that outbuildings should: not be built forward of the established building line. Policy Guidance 42 (Garages) states that: the garage should be set back at least 6m from the pavement to allow a vehicle to park in front of the garage whilst allowing the doors to be opened;they are sited in front of an established building line and oriented at right angles to the existing house.\r\rThe Kingston Borough Character Study identifies this part of Hook as being 'outer suburban' and as an 'Area with scope to reinforce the existing character'. Within the Hook Character Areas, the site falls within Character Area 3 - Orchard Road. The Orchard Road character area description is as follows: \r\r'Strong planned layout with large gardens, grass verges, hedges and street trees. A range of 1930's to 1950's styling including 1930's housing with interesting brick detailing particularly in Grange Road. Mix of housing types including semi detached, short terraces and bungalows. Relatively low density, characterised by long back gardens full of green and space which add a unifying element to the otherwise varied forms and differing building lines from the street frontages.' \r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the position and scale of the proposed development in relation to the nearby Grade II listed, it is considered that the proposal would not have any adverse impact on designated heritage assets.\r\rThe proposed outbuilding would have a footprint of approximately 55sqm and would have a maximum pitched roof height of approximately 5m (eaves height approximately 2.9m). The east and west elevations would have gable-ended roofs while the south facing element would have a hipped roof. In terms of materials, the roof would be red brown plain clay tiles while walls would be red facing brickwork. Boundary treatment is shown to be approximately 1.8m in height. The proposed outbuilding would be sited in the north-east corner of the site with a new vehicular crossover proposed to provide access onto Rosemary Gardens (no vehicular access currently exists from the application site to Rosemary Gardens).\r\rThe proposed outbuilding would require the removal of existing vegetation in the vicinity of Rosemary Gardens, including 2 trees, and some of the boundary treatment between the application site and public highway. The proposed outbuilding would be positioned forward of the dominant building line shared by Nos. 11-17 Rosemary Gardens. The north elevation of the outbuilding would be 9.6m in width and the east elevation would be approximately 8.1m in width, presenting a bulky and highly prominent form of development when viewed from Rosemary Gardens. No replacement trees are currently proposed to mitigate the removal of trees and vegetation. The garage would not be set-back from the pavement, contrary to Policy Guidance 41 of the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would be an incongruous and highly prominent addition within the street scene which would diminish the green and spacious. The proposal would have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the existing site and surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r \rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the position and orientation of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties are sufficient to ensure no significant adverse impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight, overbearing impact or undue sense of enclosure or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees\rThe Council's Tree & Landscape Officer has reviewed the proposal and raises no objection to the proposed development subject to compliance with the submitted Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would be acceptable in relation to the Category A TPO tree.\r\rHowever, the Tree & Landscape Officer disagrees with the comments within the Arboricultural information which states that there should be no requirement for replacement planting of trees as 2 trees would be removed to facilitate the development. While the trees to be removed are small, they are highly visible within the street scene of Rosemary Gardens and their removal will have a notable impact. \r\rAs such, a detailed landscape and planting plan is required including the replacement planting of two small but high amenity trees to provide additional amenity to Rosemary Gardens both on this boundary and above the height of the single storey structure as proposed. The replacement tree planting would help to soften the visual impact upon Rosemary Gardens. Both replacement trees should be planted at a minimum of 4m in height with a clear stem of 2m.\r\rThe Tree & Landscape Officer advises that a Himalayan Birch and Liquidambar could be appropriate. The Himalayn Birch should be Multistemmed in order to prevent it attaining too great a height, while providing greater spread and making it more manageable to maintain and the Liquidambar should be planted as a Standard.\r\rWere the application considered to be otherwise acceptable, the requirement for replacement tree planting could have been secured by way of a planning condition.\r\rHighway Safety\rPolicy DM9 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that to ensure that new development does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety the Council will: require new development to comply with car parking standards and implement parking management schemes.\r\rThe proposals include a vehicular crossover from the rear of the application site onto Rosemary Gardens. \r\rIt has not been demonstrated that the crossover as shown on the submitted drawings would meet the  minimum standards set out within the Vehicular Crossover Policy and Application Pack - April 2020 in relation to crossover width or visibility splay requirements. As the garage would not be set back from the pavement there does not appear to be room for visibility splays to ensure that the driver could see children from their driving position when entering/exiting the garage.\r\rNoting the position of the proposed crossover in relation to the existing crossover at No. 17 Rosemary Gardens, it is noted that any vehicles accessing the proposed garage would have to wait on the public highway while the garage doors are opened. This could inconvenience highway users and could restrict vehicular access to the owner/occupiers of No. 17 which would present an amenity issue.\r\rConclusion\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would be unacceptable from a character and design perspective and that it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not adversely impact highway safety. The associated use of the proposed garage could lead to obstructions on the public highway and to neighbouring properties which could inconvenience highway users. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. \r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Althpough the proposed external wall insulation to brickwork, on right side and rear elevation would be visible from the streetscene, it would not have a significantly negative impact, as neighbouring properties have render finishing and would appear subordinate to the main dwelling. As such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe site is located in the rear curtilage of 8 Springfield Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The buildings and curtilage are not listed. \r\rThe site is located in the Grove Crescent Conservation Area a designated Heritage Asset.\r\rProposal\r\rSection 73 application to make changes to the permitted footprint and principal elevation.\r \rConsultation \r\r5 representations received. 2 in support and 3 objections. The objections are summarised below and are addressed in the officers assessment. \r\r- Car park issues\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rKingston CAAC: No objection they state as follows\r\rThe reason for the proposed variation is a very slightly enlarged plan,\rwhich we see no reason to object to. The original consent, however,\rcontained a condition on materials which is absent from this variation\rand should, in our view, be reinstated.\r\rOfficers comment: A condition requiring a submission of details and samples would be sought. \r\rAssessment\r\rThe application seeks a minor increase in footprint and minor changes to the principal elevation of the permitted one bed unit scheme granted under planning permission 19/01241/FUL. \r\rThe unit would have a practical layout and meet internal and external spaces standards set by Policy D6 of the London Plan and the Council's Residential Design SPD. Refuse and recycling facilities and cycle parking would be secured by condition. \r\rAppropriate landscaping and boundary treatment would be secured by condition. \r\rIt is considered that the built form would be proportionate to its plot and its surroundings with the additional minor increase in footprint and coupled with the minor changes to the principal elevation would be of an archtectural style sympathetic to its surroundings. It is considered that the proposal located in a designated heritage asset (Grove Crescent Conservation Area) would cause less than substantial harm to heritage assets and would preserve the overall character of the Conservation Area. \r\rWhilst it would be visible from neighbouring properties and in glimpses from the public realm it is considered that it would provide visual interest and not be visually intrusive or an incongruous addition to the site and its surroundings. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would be of a size. siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties that would not diminish the existing living conditions of neighboiuring occupiers due to orientation of windows and separation distances between boundaries and neighbouring gardens and habitable room windows. It is considered the proposal would not have a detrimental impact on neighbouring occupiers in terms of noise, daylight/sunlight, outlook or privacy. \r\rThe permission this section 73 application seeks to alter 19/01241/FUL has a legal agreement attached that prevents future occupants of the development and their visitors from applying and obtaining an on street residents or visitors parking permit. Paragraph 14 of the legal agreement ties any subsequent varation to the parent planning permission 19/01241/FUL to the legal agreement. As such a legal agreement is in place and this would mitigate any demand for on street parking and the development would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rAppropriate conditions are recommended to secure suitable sustainbility and fire safety measures. \r \rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\r1. This approval only grants permission under Section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990. Further approval or consent may be required by other legislation, in particular the Building Regulations and you should contact Building Control at building.control@kingston.gov.uk before proceeding with the work.\r\r2.

The permission hereby granted confers no rights on the applicant to encroach upon, extend over or otherwise enter upon property not in his ownership for any purposes connected with the implementation of this planning permission.\r\r4. Care should be taken by all applicants to ensure that no damage is caused to the public highway adjacent to their site during demolition and/or construction work. The Council will always seek to recover any costs incurred in repairing or making good such damage from the owner of the development site, except where they are otherwise able to identify the person(s) who caused the damage and are willing to accept the recoverable costs.\r\r5. Where applicable, the developer/applicant is hereby advised to remove all site notices on or near the site that were displayed in pursuant to the application.\r\r6. Your work may be affected by the provisions of the Party Wall Act 1996 which requires adjoining owners to be formally notified by the owner. This is not a planning matter and further details are issued by the Government. For further information, visit the following link: https:/Iwww.gov.uklguidance/party-wall-etc-act- 1996-guidance\r\r7. In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rB. The Applicant should note that any planning permission would not override neighbouring property rights, or indeed any private property rights enjoyed by a third party. It is the applicant's responsibility to ensure they have the right to undertake the work.\r\r9. When undertaking demolition and/or building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before Bam or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before Bam or after 1 pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays. Furthermore, please ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction of the development hereby approved are properly washed and cleaned to prevent the passage of mud and dirt onto the adjoining highway. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation. For further information and advice, please contact - Environmental Health Department Pollution Section.\r\r10. Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist. This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\r11. The applicant will be responsible for the cost of all necessary changes to road markings and signage together with the cost of amending the Traffic Order for the Controlled Parking Zone.\r\r12. The Authority will not provide a vehicle crossover until all necessary amendments to the Traffic Regulation Orders have been made so as to provide unimpeded access to the crossover.\r\r13. Any vehicular crossing on Lovelace Gardens must be constructed and any redundant crossing on Lovelace Road reinstated as footway in accordance with the provisions of the Highways Act, 19BO by the Service Director (Planning & Transportation) (Highways), Directorate of Environmental Services, Guildhall II, Kingston upon Thames.\r\r14. DeliveriesDeliveries to the site will avoid peak traffic times. This is due to existing congestion along the surrounding\rroads which will be exacerbated with the proposals; Deliveries to the site should where possible avoid waiting on the highway as this could result in a reduction to road safety and emergency access; Any parking that cannot be contained within the site must park considerately and safely, so as not to obstruct sightlines at junctions or site accesses. The applicant should be aware that any such parking will cause unnecessary concern and agitation within the local community; Should make full use of the site accesses to maximise the availability of off street parking\r\r15. Servicing Service parking and deliveries should not cause any damage to the verges or margins, and no parking is\rallowed on both. A license from the Compliance Team will be required to erect off site direction signs. This same team will issue the hoarding license (if necessary) and seek appropriate deposits.\r\rThe applicant should be advised that a licence is needed for a tower crane, and should contact the Street Scene Compliance Team on 020 8547 5002. A traffic management arrangement for the delivery, erection, dismantling and removal of a tower crane (if it would be used) should be submitted for approval. The applicant should be advised to consider if a parking suspension might be needed to allow access for big delivery construction vehicles involved. To apply for parking suspension (if needed), the applicant should contact the Environment Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002.\r\r16. Highway Cleaning Should the access into the site during construction not be paved, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads. We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.\r\r17. Road Condition Survey It is highlighted that any proposed works will result in substantial movement of heavy vehicles on the highways, and therefore the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Street Scene Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins.\r\r18. The applicant is therefore advised that damage to bats and or their habitat would constitute an offence and should evidence of bats being present on site be found as a result of future development he/she must fulfil his/her duties under the Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended) and the Conservation of Habitats and Species Regulations, 2010.\r\r19. Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development.\r\r20. he development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of london's Community Infrastructure levy (MCll) and RBK CIL. Payment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner. Failure to submit a\rCommencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or f:2,500, whichever is the\rlower amount. When you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the\rowner setting out the MCll and Cll calculations. Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing. A failure to do so will incur a surcharge. Should you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the Cll more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email cil@kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.\r\r21.
