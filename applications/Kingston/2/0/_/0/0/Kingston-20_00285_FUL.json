    "Application Site\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, semi-detached dwellinghouse on the western side of Park Road, Kingston opposite to the junction with Wilmer Crescent.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character comprising of mainly two storey semi-detached dwellings. \rThe site does not contain a Listed Building and the site is not located within a Conservation Area. The site is located in Flood Zone 1.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of the existing single storey detached building and replacement with a single storey detached building with basement level residential annexe ancillary to main dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r20/01179/HOU - Demolition of existing single storey detached building and replacement with single storey detached residential annexe ancillary to main dwelling. Grant planning permission, dated 02/06/2020.\r\r21/00739/FUL - Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to carry out development without compliance with Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission ref: 20/01179/HOU (Demolition of existing single storey detached building and replacement with single storey detached residential annexe ancillary to main dwelling) to allow for creation of basement to proposed residential annexe. Refused planning permission, dated 15/03/2021.\r\rConsultation\r6no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- Impact upon the Character and Appearance of the Site and Surrounding Area; \r- Impact on the Amenities of Neighbouring Occupiers; and\r- Flood Risk, Drainage and Basement Development \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers note the recent planning permission granted in 2020 for a detached single-storey residential annexe building within the rear garden, ancillary to the main dwellinghouse (under permission reference: 20/01179/HOU). The proposals put forward in this application do not seek any alterations to the elevations of the building visible at ground level, but rather introduce a basement level to be used entirely for storage purposes. \r\rThe proposals do not alter the siting, built form, elevational detailing or massing. The acceptability of the scale and appearance of the building has already been established under the previous planning permission. The proposed introduction of a basement level would not have any visual impact above ground level and is therefore not considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the proposals under renewed assessment relate to the proposed addition of a basement level to measure to the same footprint as the approved residential annexe at ground floor and there are no changes to the ground floor elevation, overall massing or siting of the residential annexe, it is not considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reasons of overbearing, visual dominance, overshadowing, loss of light, privacy or outlook.\r\rFlood Risk, Drainage and Basement Development\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rParagraph 170 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by preventing new and existing development from contributing to, being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by land instability.\r\rParagraph 178 of the NPPF 2021 goes on to say that planning decisions should ensure that a site is suitable for its proposed use, taking account of ground conditions and any risks arising from land instability. This includes risks arising from natural hazards or former activities such as mining, and any proposals for mitigation including land remediation (as well as potential impacts on the natural environment arising from that remediation).\r\rHowever, Paragraph 179 makes clear that where a site is affected by land stability issues, responsibility for securing a safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage \rAs stated above, the NPPF sets out the criteria for when a site-specific flood risk assessment should be provided in support of a planning application and the London Plan 2021 and the Council's Core Strategy echo these requirements.\r\rThe proposal meets none of these criteria. The site is in Flood Zone 1, its area is less than 1 hectare, it is not in a critical drainage area, nor is it identified in the Borough SFRA as being at increased flood risk in future. The site is not known to be at risk from other sources of flooding (i.e. groundwater flooding) but the proposal would not, in any event, introduce a \"more vulnerable\" use to the site, since the existing use falls within this category.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a site-specific flood risk assessment or SuDS strategy as part of the proposal which, given the above, is considered appropriate. \r\rIt is recommended that a detailed SuDS design be secured by condition to ensure that the development will achieve greenfield rates of surface water run-off.\r\rBasement Development\rThe applicant has submitted a basement impact assessment, which specifically considers the impact of the proposed basement on groundwater, in support of the application. Officers are satisfied that the report is authored by a suitably qualified consultant.\r\rThe ground conditions were confirmed to be cohesive Made Ground to 5.45m overlying granular Kempton Park Gravel Member.\r\rThe site lies within Flood Zone 1, with a low risk of surface water flooding on the eastern side of the site approximately 30m from the development area. The site area was less than 1 hectare and had no risk from river or sea flooding. Therefore, the undertaking of a detailed site-specific flood risk assessment was not technically required.\r\rGroundwater was encountered in the Made Ground, but due to the cohesive nature groundwater flow would be slow and potentially laterally discontinuous. Due to the inherent variability of the Made Ground granular horizons could be encountered in other areas of the site.\r\rOfficers consider the information submitted to date is sufficient to form an assessment of the proposals, but recommend a condition for a detailed basement impact assessment to be undertaken and submitted to the Council for assessment prior to commencement of any excavation works.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and on the wider area and would not result in a materially harmful impact to the amenities of adjoining neighbouring dwellinghouses in terms of overshadowing, loss of light and visual dominance or sense of overbearing.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate otherwise, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
    "The applicant should ensure that minimum visibility splays are maintained at all times, and that no gate is capable of opening onto the public footway. The creation of a new crossover will require a separate Crossover Application to Highways. The applicant is advised to ensure that they can satisfy all requirements as stipulated in the RBK Crossover Policy 2020 (available online via the RBK website). These include restrictions on maximum width of crossover, minimum distance from an existing street tree and maximum depth of grass verge that can be traversed. If during the subsequent site visit any of these requirements are found not to be met Highways will refuse to provide the crossover, irrespective as to whether or not planning approval has been obtained.",
    "The application site comprises a commercial unit, which is part of a parade of shops on the western side of Eden Street, Kingston Upon Thames. \r\rThere are four existing condensers on the first floor flat roof at the rear of the building. The proposal is for the replacement of these condensers with new models. Two condensers would serve the AC system for the customer area and the back-of-house/kitchen area. Two other condensers would serve a new fridge and freezer. A new kitchen ventilation system is also proposed, including one supply fan and one extract fan. There are a number of properties nearby, which have existing plant. Specialist noise consultants have been instructed to prepare a Noise Impact Assessment.\r\r17 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received by the Council.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - The Environmental Health Officer is satisfied that the revised acoustic report demonstrates mitigation measures that will achieve compliance with the Council's plant noise condition. In order to provide a robust enforcement capacity going forward, the following condition, is recommended:-\r\"The rating level of the noise determined by the cumulative sound emissions of the plant hereby permitted, shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation.  The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade.  Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014.\"\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is for the replacement of four existing condensers on the first floor flat roof at the rear of the building. As such, the proposed development is considered not to have any impact on character and appearance over and above the existing situation. Furthermore, the proposed development would not be clearly visible from the streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proposal is for the replacement of four existing condensers on the first floor flat roof at the rear of the building, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy over and above the existing situation.\r\rAs demonstrated by the revised acoustic report provided in support of the application, officers consider that the proposal would not give rise to increased unacceptable noise or disturbance for occupants of neighbouring properties, particularly as a prescriptive condition in this regard, is recommended. Finally as the proposal is for air conditioning units, officers consider that the proposal would not give rise to unacceptable levels of fumes for occupants of neighbouring properties.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rEight neighbouring properties have been consulted on the proposal and 2 objections have been received relating to:\r\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy.\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed side extension would contribute negatively to the already minimal set-back from the boundary. It would therefore fail to appear subordinate or proportionate and would further erode the gap to adjacent property, No. 14 Landseer Road. Furthermore, the proposed hip end roof would not be set down from that of the original house by a minimum guidance amount of 500mm. The proposed development is therefore considered inappropriate in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, officers determine that the proposed rear and side extension would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy. As there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
