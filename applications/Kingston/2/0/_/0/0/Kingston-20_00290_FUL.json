    "The proposed first floor rear extension would appear as a discordant addition that would diminish the character of the host dwelling.The proposal would have a significant adverse effect on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. As such, the proposal fails to comply with National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The total enlargement at ground floor level, would add to an existing extension which extends beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse causing a total extension which would be more than half the width of the original house",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on the southern side of Hook Rise South. \r\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension which partly extends to the side of the property. The Residential Design SPD 2013 states that flat roof single storey rear extensions should retain at least 50% of the rear garden, should not exceed 3 to 3.5 metres in depth, and should not exceed 3 metres in height. In this case the proposed development would result in the retention of over 50% of the rear garden, and therefore the proposal is acceptable in this respect. The proposed extension would measure approximately 3.2 metres in height, which would slightly exceed the recommended maximum height set out in the Residential Design SPD. Nevertheless, this aspect would not warrant refusal alone. However, Officers note the excessive depth of the proposed extension, which would measure approximately 6.4 metres from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse. This excessive depth would not result in a proportionate or subordinate addition and would not relate well to the existing dwellinghouse, resulting in an incongruous addition. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comments: The principal properties that must be considered in this case are Nos. 339 and 335 Hook Rise South. Whilst it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact upon No. 339 in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, visual intrusion and noise and disturbance, over and above the existing situation the proposed extension would be overbearing regardless of the slight separation distance from the shared boundary.  In terms of No. 335, it is considered that the excessive depth the proposed extension, hard up against the shared boundary, would have an unacceptable overbearing impact and the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information, that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight or overshadowing to the nearest ground floor habitable room. Therefore, the proposed development is considered to conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "Please provide existing floor plans at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rThe submitted floor plans are not labelled as existing."
