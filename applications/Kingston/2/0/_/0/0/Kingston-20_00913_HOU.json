    "The proposed development by reason of its siting, height and scale would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling. Furthermore, it would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area, creating an incongruous and discordant feature within the streetscene, resulting in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area, for which there would be no public benefit to outweigh the identified harm. Conditions would not overcome the unaccepable impacts of the proposal. The proposal would therefore conflict with Paragraph 196 of the NPPF 2019, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe buildings on site are not listed or locally listed and the site does not fall within a conservation area.  \r\rProposal\rThe proposal relates to the erection of a single storey side/rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r4x neighbouring properties were notified of the proposed development. 2x responses have been received highlighting the following concerns:-\rDetails\rCommenter Type: Neighbour\rStance: Customer objects to the Planning Application\rComment Reasons:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Inaccurate submitted plans\r- Proposed 4 metre depth flank wall and 3.2 metres height of the proposal. \r-  The proposed extension would feel \"oppressive\" to the house and garden and would restrict incoming natural light to neighbouring properties.\r- The small extension to the porch at the front seems out of character as it would be the only one of the 4 houses of this design to not have the original shape.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is to the rear of the property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy Guidance 38 (Front Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD  2013 states that when designing a front extension the following guidance will apply: \r-Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. \r- New porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. \r-Porches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation. \r-The roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house. \r- All front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties.- Front extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported. \r- Front extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site\r\rThe proposed porch extension would not be sympathetic to the host building and would not be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. The proposed porch extension would not reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and would be an obvious addition. \rThe porch extension would not relate well to the host property and appear as an incongrous addition within the streetscene. The proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building and streetscene, contrary to to the Council's Residential Design SPD, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Given that the rear extension would abut the shared boundary with the adjoining property at no. 22 Selwyn Road and it would extend to a depth of 4 metres close to this neighbouring property, which is further in depth than is recommended, officers consider that the proposed development would cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no. 20 Selwyn Road. \rIn terms of loss of daylight and direct sunlight, the ground floor extension proposed, would be almost on the South side of the adjoining property at no. 20 Selwyn Road. As a result of the location of the proposed extension, there would be a significant loss of direct sunlight and daylight caused to the adjoining property at no. 20 Selwyn Road. \rThe proposed side/rear extension would be set away from the shared boundary with the adjoining property at no. 24 Selwyn Road. Taking this into account, there would be no significant overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure, loss of outlook loss of daylight or direct sunlight caused to this adjoining property.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
    "Existing Roof Plans - Please provide Existing Roof Plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of the entire property not just part and showing dimensions. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged."
