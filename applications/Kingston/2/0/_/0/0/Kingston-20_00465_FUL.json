    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to loss of light/sunlight. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth (4m v. 3-3.5m), however it would have an appropriate height and given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity, officers consider it would appear an appropriate addition to the host property, and that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be appropriately set in from the side roof slopes, given that it would be set down from the ridge and up from the eaves, it would appear a proportionate addition to the original dwelling. Further, officers note that  proposed rear dormer roof extension would appear modern in appearance, given the use of zinc cladding, and while it would differ in appearance from the original roofslope, given that it would not be viewed from the streetscene, officers consider it would appear an appropriate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that both adjoining properties benefit from existing rear extensions, and as such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling located on the south western side of Akerman Road and on the corner of Seething Wells Lane.\r\r247 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received relating to the inability to view all plans online and inappropriate design/layout. Officers have made public all the plans and reconsulted as necessary. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRBK Tree Officer - No objection.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposed extensions would not strictly comply with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD 2013 in terms of set down from the main roof ridge (in terms of the two storey side extension) and height (in terms of the single storey rear extension) the proposed development would be subordinate and proportionate. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile there are no protected trees on site, the proposal would involve the removal of some trees within the site. Officers consider that this would be acceptable given the current health of these trees, and that they would be replaced with higher quality trees.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed extensions and siting in relation to neighbouring properties, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevations, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
