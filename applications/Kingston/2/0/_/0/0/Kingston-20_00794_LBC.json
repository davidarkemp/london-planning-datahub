    "The applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to enable the local planning authority to determine the impact of the proposal on heritage assets. As such the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed works would preserve the special architectural or historic interest of the Wall. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012, Policy 7.8 of the London Plan, and Paragraph 189 of the National Planning Policy Framework 2019.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling and detached garage.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a two-storey side extension and single-storey rear extension, following demolition of existing detached garage.\r\rThe application follows an earlier scheme (21/03522/HOU) refused for the following reasons:\r\rThe proposed development, by reason of the scale, depth, siting and detailed design of the proposed two storey extension, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Oxford Crescent street scene resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension, by reason of its scale, depth, siting and design, would not be proportionate to the host dwelling and would not reflect the established pattern of development in the surrounding area resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rDue to the scale, depth, siting and design of the proposed development, combined with the absence of information to demonstrate that the proposed extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring properties at Nos.6 and 10 Oxford Crescent through loss of outlook, daylight/sunlight and an undue sense of enclosure. contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Councils adopted Residential Design SPD 2013.\r\rThe current proposal seeks to address these reasons through the following revisions:\r\rRidge of the side extension lowered to be subservient to the ridge of the host dwelling;\rRemoval of the boiler room addition from the single storey rear extension so it is no more than 3.5m deep.\r\rConsultations\r15 properties were notified of the proposal. 1 representation was received in support of the proposal stating the proposed development would improve the overall appearance of the property.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- The impact of the development on highways.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would be below the main ridge line with a roof profile that relates and reflects that of the host dwelling in accordance with the Residential Design SPD. However the extension remains less than the required setback from the front elevation and more than 50% the width of the original house, and therefore does not appear proportionate or subordinate to the host dwelling, particularly when viewed from within the streetscene.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would accord with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of scale, depth and design.  \r\rThe proposed combination of the two storey side and single storey rear extension would represent a large addition to the property, and a reduction in scale would be necessary to achieve a development that is more satisfactory in terms of its overall design and appearance and to better reflect the built form that surrounds the property. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers therefore consider that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would be setback and away from the shared boundary with No.10 Oxford Crescent, given its orientation which angles away from the shared boundary towards the rear.  The extension includes windows to its side elevation at both ground and first floor levels. However the windows at first floor level are positioned at a high level to prevent any undue overlooking or loss of privacy. The demolition of the existing garage would also increase the openness between the properties.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension accords with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD as it relates to No.6 Oxford Crescent.  Although this property has not been extended the closest windows are double glazed doors and these would not be unduly impacted on in terms of any undue loss of sunlight/daylight.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it would not constitute a loss in off-street car parking provision on site. Officers note that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate off-street car parking space that is reflective of the existing situation and considered acceptable. \r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r\r",
