    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached, two-storey dwelling located to the northern side of Tudor Drive. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of two storey side and single storey rear extension, hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 4 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r18 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\rNo statutory or internal consultations necessary.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33 (Single-Storey Rear Extensions), Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) Policy Guidance 39 (Roof Dormers) and Section 4.29 relating to gable end extensions of the SPD Guidance are applicable to this application.\r\rSingle-Storey Rear Extension\rThe SPD guidance advises that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. \r\rThe proposed extension would conflict with the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 with regards to depth. Officers note that although the neighbouring property at No.155 Tudor Drive has not been extended to the rear, other rear extensions of a similar depth are evident in the vicinity of the application property.\r\rThe extension would be full width and stepped with two pitched roof elements that would maintain a similar depth to the existing rear extension one side and project beyond this point as it relates to the shared boundary with No.155 Tudor Drive. A timber clad lean-to structure would be located on the shared boundary with No.151 Tudor Drive.\r\rAlthough officers consider a reduction in depth to be more acceptable, the proposed extension would not be visible from the street scene, and the property is not located within a Conservation Area and therefore the impact on the surrounding area would not be significant. no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rHip to Gable Roof Extension:\rAccording to section 4.29 of the Residential Design SPD, this type of hip-to-gable roof extension are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. \r\rIn this instance, the proposed hip to gable roof extension would alter the symmetry of this pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses.  Notwithstanding, Officers note that there are a variety of roof forms evident along Tudor Drive and there are examples, including some nearby to the application site, where one half of a semi-detached dwelling pair have altered the roof form from hip to gable end. It is therefore considered on balance that the proposed hip to gable roof extension would not appear unduly different within, or be harmful to, the character and appearance of the application property, adjoining property or wider streetscene. \r\rRear Roof Dormer:\rPolicy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD states that dormer windows should be designed so that they: \r-\tare set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm; \r-\tare set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm; \r-\tdo not feature on the front slope of the roof (in most cases); \r-\tare designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area; match or line-up with any original windows below; and\r-\tare not built in the style of a mansard roof \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would be sited below the ridgeline however does not appear to be set down or set in from the side and eaves of the roof in accordance with the SPD. Officers do note other large rear dormers in the vicinity of the application property and that the proposed rear dormer roof extensions, with some minor amendments, would fall within the parameters of permitted development. \r\rAlthough possibly an error officers note the proposed elevations show the rear dormer to extend beyond the application property, which would also indicate the rear dormer to be of an inappropriate scale. It is therefore considered that the proposed rear dormer would be incompatible and excessive in scale to the detriment of the host dwelling in terms of materiality and appearance and would not be a subordinate addition at roof level. \r\rThe proposed rooflights to the front roof slope are considered to be of a size and design appropriate to the host dwellinghouse and would not appear unduly uncharacteristic in the streetscene. \r\r\rTwo  Storey Side Extension:\r\rThe proposed side extension would be setback from the front elevation in accordance with the SPD, and would incorporate a roof profile that reflects and relates well to the main house and its roof form, however would be located on the shared boundary which could encourage a terrace effect should a similar development take place at the neighbouring property. It is also noted the separation between dwellings along Tudor Drive is fairly uniform and consistent. A reduction in scale or setback of the proposed extension would be necessary to preserve the character and appearance of the streetscene and to appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling.  \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, and the surrounding area and therefore would accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIn terms of neighbouring residential amenity, the main properties to consider are No.s 151 and 155 Tudor Drive. The property at No.155 Tudor Drive has not been extended to the  rear and the proposed rear extension would extend beyond this building line and the parameters of the SPD in terms of depth. There are habitable windows to the rear of No.151 which would experience some loss of outlook. It has not been demonstrated that the proposed extension would accord with the BRE 45-degree rule to ensure there is no undie loss of daylight/sunlight to this property.\r\rIn relation to No.151, the proposed two storey extension would be located along the shared boundary. Although there would be some separation between the proposed extension and the dwelling at No.151 this is afforded only due to the absence of a side extension at No.151. \r\rThere are windows proposed to the side elevation of the extension and windows to the facing elevation of No.s15 which would be affected by loss of outlook, an undue sense of enclosure and loss of daylight/sunlight, although officers note it has not been demonstrated how the proposed extension would accord with the BRE guidance in relation to these windows. The combined scale and design of the proposed extension is considered to unduly impact the amenities of both neighbouring properties and cause significant harm to the outlook, privacy and daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises of a Neo-Georgian, detached two-storey dwelling located to the eastern side of Upper Brighton Road, Surbiton.\r\rThe site does not comprise of a listed building, however the site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of single-storey rear extension. Conversion of existing garage into habitable space. Replacement of existing glass roof with raised pitched tiled roof. Replacement of front canopy to entrance. Associated changes to fenestration. Raising height of the front boundary wall with installation of electric gates.\r\rConsultation\r23no. properties were notified of the proposal. One representation received raising comments regarding potential for overlooking / loss of privacy to rear patio of neighbouring dwelling.\r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No objection.\rRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comments.\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer: No comments.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact upon heritage assets; \r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and \r- Highways and Transportation\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe single-storey rear infill extension would not comply with the guidance set out Policy 33 of the Residential Design SPD (in terms of depth) but this is considered acceptable in this instance given it would effectively infill a gap to the rear elevation and be set back from the existing rear projecting addition by 1.4m. \r\rThe proposals include a partial infill at first floor level to marginally increase the size of the bathroom and replace the existing glass wall with two separate matching windows. This is considered to be a positive improvement to the dwellinghouse, complementary to its appearance and materiality. \r\rThe first floor rear facing window would be altered to reduce its length but would be fitted with replacement stained glass. Whilst it is regrettable that the feature window would be altered and no longer full length, Officers welcome the intention to utilise stained glass in the resized window, as annotated on the plans. \r\rThe proposed conversion of the integral garage to habitable room, with the associated removal of the garage door and replacement with a window to the front elevation is considered to be acceptable in terms of design and appearance, with matching windows and brickwork used to present a consistent façade to the principal elevation.\r\rThe application also proposes the demolition of the existing lean-to structure to the side of the dwelling. Officers consider this to be an improvement, providing independent means of side access to the rear garden and visual separation between the application property and the neighbouring dwelling at No. 19B Upper Brighton Road. \r\rThe scale of the proposed front canopy is subservient to the front elevation and similar in scale to that evident at No.19b Upper Brighton Road. There is an existing smaller canopy with a triangular pitched roof and the same design is proposed. The increased depth of the existing canopy from 0.25m to 1m will not affect the parking or turning cycle of vehicles on the driveway.\r\rThe proposed front wall would measure to a height of 1.3m. The proposed wall and gate to the front curtilage follows the same design principle as the existing wall and is similar to others found along the Upper Brighton Road (e.g. No. 14, No. 14a, No. 25, No. 25A), therefore the proposed height and design would not be out of character as set out in Policy Guidance 44 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The gates will be sliding behind the walls in accordance with the guidance and this design thus ensures no loss of parking nor interference with the highway.\r\rThe current front boundary is marked by a brick wall so there will be no loss of hedgerows and the existing foundations will be reused to avoid disturbing the existing trees behind.\r\rOverall, it is not considered the proposed development would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, as well as the surrounding area and therefore would accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposed extension would change the appearance of the building. However, it is considered that the proposed rear extension would not constitute a harmful addition to detrimentally affect the character of the host building and it is considered that the extension would not result in harm to the setting of the Conservation Area given its scale and design, and the fact it would be set behind the existing massing of the application property. The other elements of the application proposals including the fenestration changes and alterations to the porch, garage and side infill extension are all considered to be appropriate to the setting of the Conservation Area and would not constitute harmful alterations to the overall character and appearance of the dwelling or wider area.\r\rIt is considered that the proposals would not result in any harm to the significance of the conservation area. \r\rAs such, the proposed development would accord with Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990, paragraphs 197 - 206 of the NPPF, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension includes one side-facing window. However, the application is supported by site photographs and Officers consider that given the boundary treatment in place along this shared boundary, the presence of the single-storey side structure with pitched roof belonging to No. 19B closest to side boundary, as well as the proposed positioning of the side window nearest to this structure, that the window would not result in any loss of privacy or opportunity for overlooking towards No. 19B. The proposed extension would not impact upon No. 19 in respect of sense of enclosure, loss of privacy or overlooking.\r\rThe proposed alterations at first floor level would simply replicate the existing scenario. Upon officers request, the applicant has submitted revised plan (dwg no. 885-A-114_P2) with annotations to specify that the windows at first floor to the flank wall of the rear extension would be fitted with obscure-glazing. As such, Officers are satisfied that the proposals would not adversely impact upon the amenities of the neighbouring property or garden at No. 19B and further southwards, beyond. \rThe other alterations proposed as part of this planning application would not result in undue impact on the amenity of either neighbouring property in terms of visual intrusion, loss of daylight, sunlight or privacy.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause significant harm to the outlook, privacy and daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers and would therefore comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rUpon officer's request, the front boundary wall treatment was revised to include a low brick wall (1m in height) with railing atop. Vehicular access via sliding electronically-operated gates, solid to 1m with open grill atop to correspond with wall and railings.\r\rFollowing review from RBK Highways Officers, they have not raised any concerns regarding visibility and highway safety from the boundary treatment, as revised (plan ref: 885-A-115_P2). \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of highway safety and as such would accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposal accords with the principles contained with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy and Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 in that it would relate well to the design of the existing dwellinghouse and would have no adverse impact on the character or quality of the character of the streetscene. \r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider conservation area, in accordance with policy DM12 of the Core Strategy and policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rIn terms of neighbouring amenity, it is not considered to result in any undue harm in regards to overlooking, loss of privacy, daylight or outlook provision. \r\rThe scheme is therefore considered to be acceptable and in accordance with the LDF Core Strategy Core Policies. Officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
