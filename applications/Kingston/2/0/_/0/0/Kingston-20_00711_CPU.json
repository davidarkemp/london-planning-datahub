    "The erection of a hip to gable roof extension, rear dormer extension and the installation of 3x front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two-storey detached building, adjacent to Bourne House a locally listed building in use as care home for the aged. \r\rThe site is located within Southborough Conservation Area. The application building is not statutory or locally listed. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of the existing garage and outbuilding, erection of a single storey side, rear and first floor rear extension. Roof alteration and erection of front and rear dormer roof extension with 2nos side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration to fenestration.\r\rPlanning History\r21/01560/HOU - Demolition of existing garages and erection of part single, part two-storey side and rear extensions with associated changes to fenestration. Roof replacement and erection of front and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Refused planning permission, dated 7th July 2021.\r\r21/02881/HOU - Demolition of existing garages and erection of part single, part two-storey side and rear extensions with associated changes to fenestration. Roof replacement and erection of front and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Refused planning permission, dated 29th October 2021.\r\rConsultation\r8no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No response received. \rRBK Trees and Landscape Officer: No comments.\rRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comments.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact upon heritage assets; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 (Two-storey Rear Extensions), and Policy Guidance 39 (Dormer Windows) of the SPD Guidance are applicable to this application.\r\r\rTaking each element in turn:\r\rFront Elevation\rThe existing front dormer is a stark and uncommon feature of buildings within the surrounding area, and the proposed front dormer is considered a more appropriate replacement.\r\rWindow alterations to the front elevation will match the overall existing design as much as possible. \r\rThe use of timber treated doors, brick and render to the front elevation are all considered satisfactory.\r\rThe proposed garage on the southern side of the dwelling would retain the setback of the existing with a roof pitch and design to match that of the main house. To the northern side of the building, the proposed storage area at ground level would reflect the roof form of the main dwelling and be setback at a distance of approximately 3m from the principal elevation to lessen the sense of dominance of built form to the street. \r\rThe combination of the ground floor extensions to both sides of the main building in general is not encouraged but officers acknowledge there is some precedence for this type of development within the street and in terms of plot layout the proposals would not appear unduly cramped. \r\rRear Elevation\rTo the rear, a more modern approach has been taken with the design of the single-storey and part two-storey extensions. \r\rThe single-storey rear extension would span the full width of the dwelling with a flat roof with a staggered depth of between approximately 2.8m and 4m from the original rear wall of the dwelling. This is considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe first floor element of the rear extension measures 4.5m (w) x 1.5m (d) beyond the main rear wall, with a large window to the rear elevation. The roof design has now been altered to a pitched roof from the previously refused flat roof design and, as such, is now considered to create a more sympathetic relationship at roof level more in keeping with the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area, in accordance with Policy Guidance 34 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rNo objection is raised in relation to the proposed rear dormer which is considered to be acceptable in terms of its overall scale, design and positioning in the rear roofslope.\r\rThe proposed use of conservation rooflights and tiles on the new roof to match the existing roof are welcomed.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rWith regards to heritage, Paragraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF, 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. \r\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe application site is located within Southborough Conservation Area, a non-designated heritage asset, which is an area characterised by, and derives its special architectural and historic interest from, the large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash.\r\rThe proposed extensions would have an appearance which would be in keeping with the architecture, character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the wider conservation area. \r\rIt is considered that the proposals would not result in harm to the significance of the conservation area. \r\rAs such, the proposed development would accord with Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990, paragraphs 197 - 206 of the NPPF, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe application property is occupied by a detached dwelling and lies adjacent to a care home on one side. On the opposite side, the proposed extensions ensure a satisfactory separation distance from the dwelling at No.3 Woodlands.\r\rThe proposals are not considered to result in undue material impact in terms of loss of privacy, overbearing or overlooking.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rOfficers consider that the proposals presented in this application have adequately addressed and overcome previous reasons for refusal. \r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and on the wider conservation area. The proposals would preserve the character and appearance of Southborough conservation area and would not result in harm to its significance as a designated heritage asset.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
