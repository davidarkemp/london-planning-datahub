    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Prior to the use of the development hereby approved, a noise and vibration assessment (including mitigation measures), manufacturer details and elevation drawings of the extraction and ventilation equipment must be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The development shall be operated strictly in accordance with the details so approved, shall be maintained as such thereafter and no change therefrom shall take place without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays\r\rReason: To protect the occupiers of neighbouring properties from noise and disturbance outside the permitted hours during the construction period, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall not be used by the public other than between the hours of 09.00am and 23.00pm Mondays to Sundays with all staff vacating the premises by 23.30pm.  \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions)  of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be used for purposes falling within Use Class A3 (restaurant) and Use Class A5 (hot-food takeaway) only, and for no any other purpose as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instruction revoking and re-enacting that Order (with or without modification), without written consent from the Local Planning Authority first being obtained. \r\rReason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control of the type of use within the category in order to safeguard the amenities of the area in accordance with Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions)  and DM17 (Protecting Existing Employment Land and Premises) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would be flat roofed and would project to the rear of the original dwellinghouse and existing side extension by 3.15 metres. The walls of the proposed rear extension would be 2.85 metres high.  The design of the proposed ground floor extension, would be to an acceptable standard and in accordance with the Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would extend within the depth recommended with the Residential Design Guide SPD for semi-detached dwellings. As a result of the height and depth of the proposal, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a pair of semi-detached dwellings.\r\r17 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposal would propose a hip-to-gable roof extension and raise the ridge of the existing roof to facilitate the loft conversion. Given that the proposal would maintain symmetry between the roofs of the adjoining properties, and that there is not a uniform roofscape within the immediate vicinity, in terms of ridge height, officers consider that the proposal would not appear incongruous within the immediate vicinity.\r\rFurther, while the proposed L-shaped dormer would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers note that the proposal was previously granted under ref: 21/01992/HOU and as such significant weight is attached to this fallback position. In any case, given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity it would not appear out of keeping with the appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rWhile openings are proposed to the side elevations at second floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that the windows are obscure-glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
