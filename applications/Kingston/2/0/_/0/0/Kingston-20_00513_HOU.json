    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey terraced dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the conversion of the property used as 2no. self-contained flats into a single family dwellinghouse\r\rNo external changes are proposed, other than general improvement work and landscaping. \r\rConsultation\r14 properties were notified of the proposal. Two representations were received in support of the proposal to be converted to a single family dwelling. In particular that amenities would improve. \r\rRBK Environmental Health Team - no objection subject to hours of work being restricted as recommended (secured by condition)\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The planning history;\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of the proposed accommodation;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- The impact of the development on highway safety;\r- Cycle parking; and,\r- Car parking.\r\rPlanning History\rPlanning permission was previously refused under application reference 21/01078/CPU for the conversion of property used as 2no. self-contained flats into a single family dwellinghouse. The reasons for refusing that application were:\r\rThe proposed conversion of two residential units into one residential dwelling is considered to amount to development constituting a material change of use under Section 55(1) of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.\r\rUnder the provisions of section 57 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, planning permission is required for the use, however, planning permission has not been granted for the development by way of a development order or by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy H1 of the London Plan 2021 sets a target for the Borough of 9,640 net housing completions within the next ten years. Planning decisions should optimise the potential for housing delivery on all suitable and available brownfield sites to ensure that this target is met.\r\rPolicy H8 of the London Plan 2021 states that the loss of existing housing should be replaced by new housing at existing or higher densities with at least the equivalent level of overall floorspace. \r\rPolicy DM14 of the Core Strategy states the Council will resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types) and, in particular, dwellings which are suitable for family accommodation. \r\rThe site is in an established residential area. It is not subject to any designations or environmental constraints that might fundamentally conflict with conversion of the property into a single dwelling. It is also noted that the original use of the property was as a single dwelling and converted into two x 1 bed flats some years ago (circa 1986). Although the proposal would not provide new housing of the same or higher density, it would retain the use of property for housing and also provide a family dwelling meeting an identified need, in accordance with DM14 of the Core Strategy.\r\rIt is also noted that many of the properties along Douglas Road are in use as single dwelling houses and whilst difficult to determine the extent to which any of these may have been subdivided into flats, externally they mostly have the appearance of family-sized homes. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that there is no in principle reason to resist the development.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rThe applicant has demonstrated that the proposed internal areas will be vastly improved by conversion of the property with adequate room sizes and layout. The 3 bed dwelling would meet the minimum internal space standards set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan with a total of 124.69m2 of floor space (2021). \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires developments to provide adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have a minimum of 50sqm of private garden (plus an extra 5 sqm for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would both benefit from a rear garden in excess of the requirements of Policy Guidance 13.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rAll works associated with the proposed change of use are internal. Officers therefore consider the development would preserve the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rAs noted above all proposed works associated with the proposed change of use are internal and given the conversion from two flats to a single dwelling, which would minimise the intensity of use, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in any unacceptable adverse impacts on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of overbearing appearance, loss of light, loss of privacy, or any other environmental harms.\r\rHighway Safety and Car Parking\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe property has a PTAL rating of 2. The maximum residential parking standard set out in the London Plan for a one bed dwelling is 0.75 spaces per flat. For a three bedroomed property the maximum standard is one space per dwelling. Whilst there is no provision of off street parking, the proposal will reduce the number of dwellings on site and the intensity of use of the site. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on highway safety and likely reduction in the demand for on street parking.\r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rNo provision is shown for cycle parking however this will be secured by condition and officers note there is sufficient space on site to ensure adequate cycle parking can be provided.  \r\r\r\r\r\rConclusion\rThe scheme under consideration involves the provision of housing and the Council cannot demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. Therefore, the \"tilted balance\" as set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF is engaged.\r\rThe proposed development would provide one less dwelling on the site, at a time when the supply of land for housing within the Borough is constrained. Notwithstanding, the proposal would retain residential use of the property, would provide family accommodation that is an identified need in the Borough, of a higher quality than currently exists.    \r\rFurther, the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area, on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, and on highway safety would be acceptable. The standard of the proposed outdoor space and the level of proposed cycle parking would also be acceptable. These are neutral matters.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to aspects of the development plan. However, Paragraph 11 of the NPPF is a material consideration and officers consider that the adverse impacts of granting permission would not significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. Accordingly, Paragraph 11 warrants a decision other than in accordance with the development plan and officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\r\r\r",
