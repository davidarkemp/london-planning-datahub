    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 the premises shall be used only as D1 nursery and for no other use within Class D1 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987, or succeeding legislation.\r\rReason: To ensure that the functioning of the development is satisfactory and to\rsafeguard the amenities of adjoining occupiers in accordance with Policy DM1 0 (DesignRequirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Officer Report\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located within the Food Zone 2.\r\rProposal \rErection of hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3 nos front rooflights.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Flood Risk; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r24/00547/HOU Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with Juliet balcony and installation of 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion - Refused on 02.05.2024\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current application is a resubmission of the refused scheme ref 24/00547/HOU for Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with Juliet balcony and installation of 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion due to the following reason:\r\rDue to its siting and lack of any separation distance to the common boundary with No 22 Vallis Way, as well as its excessive bulk, scale and mass, the proposed hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions, would constitute a disproportionate and dominant addition that would result in terracing effect and unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area, contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe submitted plans show reduction in mass and bulk of the rear dormer as well as improved design of the roof joining the hip to gable roof extension. The proposal is considered to appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host dwelling in general compliance with policy Guidance 39. As such it is considered that the applicant has successfully addressed the previous reason for refusal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rIt is considered that the floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling as the proposal relates to loft conversion, in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
