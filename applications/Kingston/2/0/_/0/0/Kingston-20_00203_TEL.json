    "The proposed development by virtue of its siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location as it would both constitute inappropriate development in the green belt and create an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views of the site and detract from the character and appearance of the area. In the absence of very special circumnstances being demonstrated that would individually or cumulatively outweigh the purposes of including land within it or the harm to the green belt the development proposed would not accord with paragraphs 143 - 147 of the National Planning Policy Framework and policies CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r16 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposed development on highways and transportation matters\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side extension would not strictly accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, it would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling and have a modest height, and as such would appear a proportionate addition to the host property. The proposed single storey rear extension would adhere to the recommendations set by the Residential Design SPD and as such would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed rear and side extensions would be readily visible on the Camel Grove streetscene. While the surrounding area is quite uniform in character and appearance, officers note that the host property already benefits from an existing rear extension, and No. 5 Camel Grove already benefits from a single storey side extension (ref: 07/12950/FUL). As such, officers consider that the proposed single storey rear and side extension would not be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate area.\r\rThe proposed single storey front porch extension would have a modest depth and height, and would continue the roof form of the existing garage and porch canopy, it would be constructed in materials to match the existing dwelling and therefore officers consider it would not appear an incongruous addition to the host property. While porch extensions are not viewed on the Camel Grove streetscene, given the modest dimensions and that it would only be partially viewed from the streetscene, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rGive that the proposed alterations to the front fenestration would match that of adjoining property No.10 Camel Grove, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development, and it would appear an appropriate alteration to the existing property.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and design of the proposed works in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, however given that the existing internal dimensions would not conform to modern day standards as set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposed development would not result in the loss of on-site parking. However, the resulting on-site provision of 1 space would accord with London Plan standards.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking and while it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, given that there is access to the rear of the property officers consider that cycle parking can be accommodated in the rear garden.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
