    "The site lies within Flood Zone 3a, and the sequential test requirement has not been passed.  It is therefore considered that the proposal is not an appropriate form of development taking into account its flood zone location. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policy 5.12 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM 4 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the future occupiers of the proposed dwelling would be afforded with reasonable standard of living accommodation, in terms of outlook, daylight and sunlight and private amenity space.

    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the loss of the existing six garages would not result in unacceptable parking stress and lead to additional congestion as drivers seek a parking space, or park illegally, which in turn, would have a harmful effect on highway safety in the area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policies  DM 9 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal fails to demonstrate that the development would not harm the living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers at number 26 Knights Park, in terms of loss of daylight and sunlight. As such, the proposal would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policy DM 10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Based on the limited information that has been provided, the application fails to demonstrate the proposed development would not harm the health of the retained trees labelled as T3 and T4 on the submitted drawings.

    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.

    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi detached dwelling house located in Parkgate Close. The site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC)-a non-designated heritage asset. \r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey side extension.\r\rConsultations\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation was received in support of the proposal.\r\rHistoric England - Do not consider consultation necessary.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings and;\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the proposed side extension is not strictly in accordance with the parameters of the Residential SPD in terms of its setback from the front elevation of the host building, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, height, massing, and design. Officers also acknowledge the proposed extension would not be highly visible to surrounding properties or the streetscene, given the siting of the application property within Parkgate Close which would not be highly visible from the street scene or neighbouring properties. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Given its scale and siting, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficers Comments: As stated above the application property falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Local Area of Special Character (SASC) which is a non-designated heritage asset. As also stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would relate well to the host property and have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area due to the scale, siting and design of the proposed single storey side extension. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Cleaveland Road/The Mall SASC.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the Sustainable Transport SPD (2013).\r\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site relates to the recently completed Primark Store at 70-76 Eden Street. The site is within the Primary Shopping Area, and on a Secondary Shopping Frontage as defines within the K+20 Kingston Town Centre Action Area Plan 2008.\r\rProposal\rErection of new 2.5m high metal security gates to cover  boundary of the existing loading bay to rear of store, in PPC black finish to match adjacent structure.\r\rConsultation\r74 Surrounding properties were notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer  - Raised issue relating to sweep path for turning lorries. An amended plan was submitted showing the sweep path on 11.03.2022 and the neighbourhood engineer then confirmed no objection to the proposed works.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on flooding.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor works such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main building and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
