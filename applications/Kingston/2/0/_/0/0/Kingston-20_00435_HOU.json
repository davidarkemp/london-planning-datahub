    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Details of the facing materials (including manufacturer(s) specification, colour, texture and dimensions) to be utilised in the development hereby permitted shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to above ground works. The development shall then be built in accordance with these approved details.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "A1 - Loading",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe applicant seeks permission for the erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed hip-to-gable roof extension would not necessarily adhere to recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers note that the proposed extension could be constructed under permitted development. Further, while the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the side roof slope, it would be set in from the eaves and ridge of the roof slope and would appear a proportionate addition to the original dwelling, it is therefore considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight, and privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r"
