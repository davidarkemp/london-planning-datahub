    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r-the height and bulk of the building; and,\r- loss of light/sunlight. \r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed two storey rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of set down from the ridge of the original roofslope and set in from the shared boundary, it would have an appropriate roof form and would appear in keeping with the principal side and rear elevation of the property. Furthermore, it would not be visible from the street and would be finished in appropriate materials. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts in terms of character or appearance as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  While the proposed extension would only be separated from the shared boundary with neighbouring property No. 66 Malden Hill by approximately 0.6m, as stated above it would be in keeping with the existing principal side and rear elevations. Therefore, it would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 66 Malden Hill by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light to principal habitable room windows. While additional openings are proposed facing No. 66 Malden Hill at first and second floor level, it is considered possible to mitigate any loss of privacy/overlooking by ensuring that they would be obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels in the event of an approval. However, this approach could only be taken in relation to secondary windows that didn't relate to habitable rooms.\r\rGiven the separation distance between the proposed extension and No. 70 Malden Hill, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 70 Malden Hill.\r\rIn terms of ensuring good standards of amenity and accommmodation for existing and future occupants of the development site, it is considered that obscuring the principal window of the middle bedroom located on the first floor would result in a complete loss of outlook, which is unacceptable.  Further and in the absence of a proposed section plan, it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrarte that the two bedrooms at second floor level would benefit from adequate levels of outlook. It is also unclear whether these rooms would benefit from adequate levels of light.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises emplyment land and premises (MOT Centre).\r\rProposal \r\rDemolition of existing MOT garage building and erection of replacement two storey, 3 bedroom dwelling house (with roofspace accommodation) and refuse and cycle provision\r\rConsultation:\r\rTwo objections received and summarised as follows\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rOfficer comment matters raised in the objection assessed in the assessment below.\r\rPollution control officer no objection.\r\rRelevant history \r\r18/12752/FUL Demolition of existing MOT garage building and erection of a (replacement) two storey, 3 bedroom dwelling house (with roofspace accommodation) Permitted with conditions\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Loss of employment\r- Hosuing Supply\r-Standard of accommodation\r- Design of the proposed development; and,\r- Impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Highways\r- Fire safety\r\rLoss of employment: \r\rPolicy DM17 seeks to protect all employment land and premises in the borough. The applicant has failed to provide any marketing evidence to justify the loss of employment use of the site and as such the proposal would be contrary to policy DM17 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy.\r\rHousing supply\r\rThe proposal would provide a family sized unit a net increase of one residential unit on the site. The Council does not have a 5 year housing supply and the proposal would help contribute to the Borough's London Plan target (policy H1 table 4.1) for year on year housing of 964 new homes a year for the 10 year period from 2021.  This is given weight in the overall consideration of the proposal as per paragraph 11 (d) of the NPPF. \r\rStandard of accommodation \r\rThe proposed development would meet the minimum internal (90 sqm) and external (50 sqm (+5sqm per additional bedroom above 3 beds amenity space) space standards as set out in the London Plan Policy D6 table 3.1 and the Council's residential Design SPD.  \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate by way of a parking beat survey that the development would not result in an increase in on street parking pressures and in turn lead to congestion and prejudice highway safety and in the absence of any off-street parking or a signed and completed legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors from applying from on street parking permits to mitigate any potential on street parking pressures the proposed development would not accord with paragraph 111 of the NPPF and policies 6.1 of the London Plan and policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rFire safety\r\rThe application is not supported by any detail as to the future occupants fire safety and as such the proposal would not accord with policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than the proposal is not in accordance with the development plan. \r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments to planning permission reference: 19/02482/FUL:\r\r- Layout changes to the semi-detached houses to the rear of the site\r\rThe proposed changes represent minor alterations to the layouts of the ground and first floor internal accommodation of the two semi-detached dwellinghouses to the rear of No's 318-320 Ewell Road. \r\rThe proposed alterations would see the ground floor have a self-contained reception room to the front, with open plan kitchen/dining room to the rear. A ground floor wc and storage cupboards would be retained at ground floor. At first floor, the layout has been reconfigured slightly to allow for an en-suite to be added to the master bedroom. Dedicated cupboard storage would remain. The rear window to the bathroom would be slightly larger than that originally consented. The proposed changes do not harmfully impact upon room sizes which comply with technical space standards and all habitable rooms would continue to be provided with windows. There are no changes proposed to window and door placements (aside from the slight enlargement of the rear window at first floor serving the family bathrooms which would continue to be obscure-glazed) or external materiality or layout of the dwellinghouses from that as originally approved. Officers consider it necessary to carry across the condition regarding the need for obscure-glazing to the enlarged family bathroom windows and reapply to this non-material amendment application.\r\rOfficers consider the proposals would not result in a material harmful effect on the layout of the dwellings, nor have a detrimental impact to the amenity afforded to the future occupants. Officers are similarly satisfied that the proposed amendments would not give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the development from the streetscene or to neighbouring amenities. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendment is considered to be non-material and it is recommended that the application be granted.\r",

In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 38 of the Residential Design SPD 2013, provides guidance for the building of front extensions, including porches. The front porch extension would reflect the character of the main house, and other porch additions in the immediate area. In terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAs stated above, Officers have concluded that there would be no adverse impact upon character and appearance. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Berg Estate LASC.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The introduction of a front porch extension, would still allow the parking off street of at least one car. Therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy and Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
