    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\r\rConsultation\r2 Neighbouring properties have been notified and following amended plans being submitted on 03.01.2023 a further 14 day consultation letter was sent. Overall, 6 objections from 2 different addresses have been received stating;\r- Effects on trees\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rIt is noted that that application form states there will be no loss of trees, however, it is noted that the tree root protection area of nearby trees would possibly be affected from the proposed development. The site and adjoining sites, are not covered by a Tree Protection Order (TPO).  \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:The application proposes the construction of a single storey extension to the rear of the dwellinghouse. Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be\rdesigned so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies:\r If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r In all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain.\r Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth.\r Extensions with a flat roof should not exceed 3m in height.\r Extensions with a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height.\r Extensions with a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height.\r\rThe proposed extension would measure 5.3 metres in depth, and would have a flat roof measuring approximately 3.4 metres in height. The excessive depth and height of the proposed extension, hard up to the boundary with No. 57 Cambridge Gardens would ensure that the development would not appear proportionate and subordinate to the original dwellinghouse. The proposed development is therefore considered to not be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 57 and No. 61 Cambridge Avenue. The proposed development would be situated to the rear of the existing dwellinghouse. With specific regards to No. 57 Cambridge Avenue, due to the excessive depth, officers anticipate that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the light and outlook of neighbouring habitable room windows, resulting in an undue sense of enclosure. It has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would be compliant with BRE guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: No Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, located in the Grove Crescent Conservation Area of which The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: A planned mid-Victorian estate of houses of various sizes and styles, the core of which forms the Spring Grove Estate, including St John's Church, a school, and local shops.\r\rOfficers note that this application follows a recently refused application 22/03229/HOU dated 07/12/2022. The reason for refusal was as follows;\r\r1) The proposed development would be incongruous and jarring when viewed within the street scene and would not respect the character of the existing dwelling or the wider area. The proposed development would cause less than substantial harm to the Grove Crescent Conservation Area which would not be outweighed by any public benefit. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013), Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and the NPPF (2021).\r\rThis application would need to address this reason for refusal.\r\r21 neighbouring properties have been notified and 1 representations has been received in support of the application.\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No comments have been provided for this application but it is noted that they raised an objection to the previous application stating; 'The proposed rear dormer is large (almost full width of roof) & would be clearly visible from the public highway (Denmark Road).

This would cause harm to the character and appearance of the CA.'\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer - No objection as would not cause harm to trees in Conservation area\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on the Grove Crescent Conservation Area\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and  buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy DM12 is clear that the Council will: 'ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area' and preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers acknowledge that the proposed dormer has been reduced in size. However, the use of zinc cladding still remains and would still be considered to be inappropriate within the Conservation Area. The rear dormer would be highly visible from Denmark Road to the rear and would not complement the character of the original dwelling. The proposed materials would not complement the existing roof tiles. It would appear incongruous and jarring in appearance from the street and to the original property by way of its overall design.  It is considered, on balance, that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rOfficers consider that the dormer addition would amount to less than substantial harm to the conservation area and it is therefore necessary to weigh this against any public benefits of the proposal. The applicant has not advanced any arguments as to the public benefits of the proposal, nor is it apparent to Officers that there would be any. The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in conflict with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policies CS8, DM12 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021).\r",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house which shows a small outrigger to the rear.

The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the both adjoining properties. \r\rThe proposed high level window to the west side elevation is considered to be acceptable in this case, as the existing rear extension at the adjoining property has no openings to the side. Therefore there would be no loss of privacy or undue overlooking in relation to No 8 Clevedon Road as a result of the proposal. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached 3 storey townhouse located within the Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character and Flood Zone 2. \r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing porch and entrance and erection of single-storey side extension, conversion of existing garage to habitable space and associated changes to fenestration.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r22/01188/HOU -  Demolition of existing porch and entrance and erection of single-storey side extension, conversion of existing garage to habitable space.

Installation of 1no rooflight and associated changes to fenestration -  Refused on 21.06.2022\r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Local Area of Special Character and,\r- The impact of the development on the existing car parking facilities;and,\r- Fire Safety; and,\r- Flood Risk\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The current scheme is a revised proposal of the previous planning application 22/01188/HOU refused due to the following reason (in relation to character and appearance):\r\r1. The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its siting, size and design (not being set back from the front elevation) and type and colour of the proposed materials would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the immediate surrounding area. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area and would result in harm to the significance of the Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy Paragraph HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012\r \rIt is noted that the proposed side extension would be set back from the front elevation by 500mm and its width would not exceed 50% of the original house, in accordance with Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe proposed, modest height of the parapet roof would be approximately 3.2m. The proposed flat roof form is acceptable in this case as similar developments are present within Watermans Close, for example the existing side extension at the adjoining property. \r\rThe proposed replacement of all the openings to be similar in appearance to the existing ones and installation of a rooflight is considered acceptable. \r\rAs the proposed conversion of garage into habitable space with associated alterations is a common feature on Watermans Close, it is considered that it would not have significant impact on the host dwelling and the surrounding area. It is noted that the balcony balustrade at the first floor would be refurbished, matching the existing materials and design. \r\rThe proposed materials would be similar in appearance to the existing ones and  therefore are considered to be in keeping with the host dwelling, other properties within Watermans Close and the immediate surrounding area. \r\rGiven the above, it is considered that the applicant has overcome the previous reason of refusal, and due to the siting, design and proposed materials of the side extension, the proposed development is considered acceptable  It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting, design (no new openings are being proposed to the side elevation) and modest height would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application property falls within the Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact to the host property or the character and appearance of the local area of special character. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of the Woodside Road/Eastbury Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rCar Parking\rDespite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling, as demonstrated on the proposed plans, remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rIt is noted that conversion of the garages and parking in front/at the back of the properties is a common feature at Watermans Close. \r\rNotwithstanding the submitted plans indicating location of  the proposed cycle parking to compensate for the loss of the garage, further details to demonstrate secure cycle parking and the proposed materials and design for the cycle (and bin) storage would be secured via condition. The existing on-site car parking space is shown to be retained.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rFlood Risk\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe submitted plans show that the proposal would be set no lower than the main dwelling, however a flood risk assessment form that includes appropriate mitigation measures to be implemented as part of the proposed development should be submitted in order to comply with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The site is located within the Old Malden, Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rConsultations\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been received, relating to:\r-Excessive height of bulk of buildings- Inappropriate design/layout- Loss of light/sunlight- Privacy \rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and, \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the ground floor rear extension would not respect the residential design SPD in regards to the flat roof design, however, it would follow the height guidance of 3m for proposed flat roofs. It is also acknowledged that the proposal would sit at a greater depth than 4.9m when considering previous rear extension(s), this would fall outside the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33. Nevertheless, the proposal would sit at the same depth as adjoined semi-detached No. 10 Church Road. On balance, officers consider the proposed rear extension to be acceptable in regard to character and appearance.\rThe proposed two-storey side/rear extension would have a flat roof which would not fall in line with the Residential Design SPD, as the host dwelling has a pitched roof design. The proposal would also not be set in from the boundary by 1m, however, officers would not consider this a detrimental issue, as the gap between the two dwellings has already been significantly eroded. Additionally, the proposal would only be slightly visible from the streetscene and the applicant proposes matching material and similar fenestration use and there already exists some flat roof at first floor level. \rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension and the two storey side extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rules and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The dimensions of the proposed garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking, as such, would not comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. However, it is noted that the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide 2 adequate car parking spaces, which would be acceptable levels of on-site car parking. \r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would reasonably adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD and would not be visible from the streetscene. Therefore, the proposal would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Old Malden, Area of Archaeological Significance.\rHistoric England (Archaeology) was not consulted on this proposal as the proposal would not fall within the following catergories:\r\r- Major planning applications over 0.5 hectares whether in an APA or not\r- Environmental Impact Assessment Scoping requests and Environmental Statements\r- Applications supported by an archaeological desk-based assessment\r- Minor planning applications in any APA (tiers 1 to 3)\r- Domestic basement applications in APA tiers 1 and 2 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers consult GLAAS on any domestic basement in an APA.\r- Householder and equivalent-scale very minor applications in APA tier 1 only. Note: For boroughs as yet without APA tiers do not consult GLAAS on householder or equivalent applications unless within 50m of a scheduled monument.\r- Proposed substantial demolition or major alterations to historic buildings\r- Submission of details in relation to archaeological conditions\r- Appeals on applications for which an archaeological issue has previously been identified\r\rAs such, no comment would be required from Historic England (Archaeology).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is located within the Groves Conservation Area.\r\r8x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1x representation has been received, highlighting the following concerns:-\r\r- Effects on trees\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- a neighbouring property would be deprived of a lot of light. \r- The loss would result in the angle of side light \"significantly below 45 degrees\" from the side.\r - The \"current boundary of the existing garage is already at the 45 degree side light limit\".\r- The drawings of the proposed extension, \"do not show how this window is affected adversely by the reduced angle of light from the side\".\r- A request from a neighbour that \"the new proposed building is limited to the existing boundary of the garage.\"\r- A neighbouring study/playroom window would also \"have its light blocked\" by the proposed extension.\r- A neighbour has noted a \"significant loss of light was the grounds that the previous planning proposal was rejected.\"\r- \"Increasing the wall higher than the existing garage wall\", would block light to windows to a neighbouring property.\r= The proposed drawings show a red line indicating a 45 degree angle of light to neighbouring windows from \"above the new wall\".  However, in \"accordance with guidelines on the Council website\", the measurement should be a 25 degree angle from our windows, in the horizontal plane, to the top of the proposed new wall. Therefore the neighbour believes \"the new wall should not be so high.\"\r- The Host Property has an existing a double story extension at the back of the house. \r- \"The boundary of the original house ended at the garage. So this proposed extension of the garage would be an extension on top of an existing extension.\"\r- The proposed extension is in a conversation area adversely affecting flora & fauna.\r- Addition of 3 velux windows to the roof of this new building, would cause privacy issues.\rCase Officer comment:- The RBK Tree Officer In comments made for the previous identical scheme (22/03155/HOU}, had no objections to the proposals. There will be a slight loss of natural light to the neighbouring property at no.96 and the applicant for the current application has incorrectly indicated a 45 degree daylight line instead of a 25 degree daylight line. However, the side windows at no.96, facing the host property are set away from the proposed development, there is an existing garage to the side of the host property and the windows to a study/playroom are not classed as those to a habitable room under Building Regulations. The proposed single storey side extension would therefore not have a significant impact on no. 96 Chestnut Grove in terms of daylight/sunlight, or overbearing appearance. The addition of 3 rooflight windows to the roof of the proposal would not cause significant privacy issues, as a result of these being at a high level and not directly facing neighbouring side facing windows. The remainder of the concerns highlighted in this representation are addressed later in this report.\r\rRBK Tree Officer (In comments made for an identical scheme 22/03155/HOU}:- I have no objections to the proposals The trees to be removed as part of the proposal are more shrubs and lapsed hedging and they are not contributing to public amenity.\rMaldens & Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee- No Objection\r\rRelevant Planning History\r00/04315/FUL- Erection of a two-storey rear extension- GRANTED 27.02.2001\r22/03155/HOU- Erection of single storey side extension (following demolition of existing garage)- REFUSED 30.11.2022 for the following reason:-\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey side extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on no. 96 Chestnut Grove in terms of daylight/sunlight and overbearing appearance. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the BRE guidelines and reduce light entering into the neighbouring windows, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant(s) of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on designated heritage assets;\r- Transportation; and,\r- Fire Safety.\t\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear and side extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light As such, the proposal is therefore in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.  \r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as a planned estate of roads laid out in the 1850s by the National Freehold Land Society, an early building society dedicated to voting reform, with plots developed in an individual and piecemeal fashion throughout the 19th & 20th centuries.\r\rAs noted above, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of The Groves Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. As previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the replacement of an attached garage to the side of the property, with a ground floor side extension. However, the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate one spaces for on-site parking. The PTAL for this part of Chestnut Grove is 2. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1 space per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 2 - 3, 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which can be secured through condition.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
