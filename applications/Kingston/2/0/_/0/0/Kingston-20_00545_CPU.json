    "The proposed single storey rear extension  would not be externally finished in materials of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse, contrary to Condition A.3 (a), Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on the north eastern side of Manor Drive North. Manor Drive North is designated as a Borough Strategic Walking Network\r\rConsultations\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development; and,\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comment: The application site has an existing single storey side and rear extension. The proposed extension is of a similar design and scale to the existing, and therefore the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the original dwellinghouse. Officers note however the unusual design of the roof of the proposed extension, incorporating a hipped, gable and flat roof. Notwithstanding, the impact of the roof design is minimal on the development and would not be visible from the streetscape. As such, the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the immediate surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbances.\r\rOfficers Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan."
