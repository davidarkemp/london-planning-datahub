    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the north-east (flank) or south-west (flank) elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the north-east (flank) or south-west (flank) of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no objections have  been received relating to: the proposal.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would not adhere to the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth,. Officers consider that the proposal would conflict with policy guidance 8 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Given that the rear extension would almost abut the shared boundary with the adjoining property at No. 53 Cheyne Hil and it would extend further in depth than is recommended, officers consider that the proposed development would cause an unacceptable increase in the sense of enclosure to and  loss of outlook to the  adjoining property at No. 53 Cheyne Hil.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed alterations would be modest and would be finished in materials to match the existing dwelling, as such it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the nature of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not had a width that would conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. However, officers note that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient in providing on-site car parking spaces. \r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage, given that there is existing access to the rear garden of the dwelling, officers consider that cycle storage could be facilitated here. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
