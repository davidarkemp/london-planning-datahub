    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the dwelling. The original layout of the dwelling has a rear projection (bay window) and as a result the proposed extension would extend beyond an original side wall and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The development therefore conflicts with paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\rThe proposal would require planning permission.\r",
    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a flat.\r\rProposal\r\rAlterations to fenestration (enlargement of side window and rear door opening)\r\rConsultation\r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No objection\r\rAssessment\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- The impact on heritage assets.\r\rDesign\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed changes to fenestration would be relatively minor in scale to the side and rear of the dwelling and would not be highly visible from public vantage points.The proposed fenestration is considered to be of a domestic scale which would not result in any impact on the character or appearance of the area. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed fenestration would replace existing fenestration of a similar position and boundary treatment would remain unchanged. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site forms a part of No. 26 Maple Road which is a Locally Listed Building (LLB). The site is located within the St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. The majority of buildings within the Conservation Area, including the application site, were built between 1876-1884 by local developers Corbett and McClymont in the Gothic style.\r\rThe proposed window on the side elevation would be UPVC replacing an existing UPVC window. The aluminium bi-fold doors on the rear elevation would replace existing timber patio doors and smaller windows. The replacement UPVC window on the side elevation is considered to be an acceptable material given that it would replace an existing UPVC window, would be suitable in its own right, and would not be highly visible within the street scene. The aluminium patio doors to the rear would not be visible from public vantage points and are considered to be of an acceptable appearance.\r\rOfficers consider the significance of the LLB to be derived primarily from uniform proportions, form and scale of building which is shared with the wider terrace of properties along the south side of Maple Road. No changes are proposed to the front elevation of the building. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and its significance. The proposals would not harm the signifiance of the Locally Listed Building.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed side elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rWe require existing side elevations also, the submitted proposed side elevations do not show the full elevation of the main house and also they are not labelled as proposed.",
    "For the application to be exempt from a fee, please supply documentary evidence to confirm that the application is in relation to works to alter or extend an existing dwelling for a disabled person who is living or intending to live at the application property.  Such evidence may include Doctor's or Occupation Health correspondence.",
    "Please provide a revised copy of block plan scaled 1:500/1:200 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rPlease note the properties to rear and those opposite should be shown in full outline. \r\rPlease hatch or shade only the area of the proposed works (eg. extension)"
