    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The materials and finishes of the external walls and roof the development hereby approved shall match in colour and texture to those of the existing building, or such other materials as shall have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall thereafter be retained as such. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the second floor side (east) window serving a bathroom as shown on the approved drawings shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-deatched dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design at the side at first floor. Whilst the scheme is a revision of 21/00203/FUL it is considered that the proposed first floor side extension would be an incongruous addition to the host property. It is considered its proportions would appear 'squat' and 'stark' and would jar with the overall character and appearance of the host property and unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties the host property forms part of and as a result would be visually intrusive in the streetscene.  It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy (delete as appropriate).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Please confirm description ''Demolition of existing rear extension and outbuilding, erection of part two storey and part single storey side and single storey rear extension. Installation of 1no side and 1no rear rooflights. Erection of cycle storage, electric gate and fence including widening the driveway access. Alteration to existing gate.''",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rNote: Elevations need to be correctly titled as existing or proposed, if already built, this need to be titled as proposed and the pre-existing elevations titled as existing.",
    "The site address is catagorized as shop, therefore the application fee will be calculated once we received the existing and proposed floor plans."
