    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the first floor window in the side (east) elevation serving as 'ensuite bathroom' as shown on the approved drawings shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises a vacant site pending redevelopment for 950 residential units (211 in the first detailed phase)\r\rProposal\rConstruction of single storey temporary boiler plant and generator (Energy Centre) (Sui Generis use class) and associated ancillary development including fence around development. \r\rConsultation Responses\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer: No objection \r\rAssessment\r\rThe key issues in the assessment of this application are:\rPrinciple of Development;\rCharacter, Design \rSustainability\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is acceptable only on the basis that it allows the 211 residential units to be built. \rCharacter, Design & Impact on Heritage Assets\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal consists of close board fencing around the proposed single storey building. It would not impact on heritage assets. The design would only be acceptable for a temporary period. A condition is attached.\r\rSustainability:\r\rApplicant's Proposed Strategy\rThe proposed energy strategy follows the same principles of the existing strategy. Temporary boilers providing\rheat to Phase 1 will be provided. These and the ancillary equipment to support them will be contained within a\rtemporary boiler plant room adjacent to Phase 1 instead of within the building footprint.\rPhase 2 will contain the site wide energy centre, as before, and this will connect into Phase 1 once this is built,\rallowing the temporary plant to be removed. The thermal performance of Phase 1 has also improved, as\rdemonstrated in the Part L1A and L2A reports appended to this note, with CO2 reductions of 10% and 2%\rrespectively.\rA detailed application for Phase 2 will be made in the future. This will include a detailed Energy Strategy\rapplying the new GLA policy of decarbonisation. The new Energy Centre will include heat pumps to provide a\rlarge proportion of the heat to the site and utilise low temperature heat network principles. Combined with the\rnew fuel carbon factors this will greatly increase the CO2 reduction of the development, including Phase 1,\ronce this is connected. There will also be an improvement to the local air quality compared to the approved\rscheme.\rConfirmation of the CO2 reductions and overall performance will be confirmed in the Phase 2 Energy Strategy.\r\rConclusion\rAs can be demonstrated the principles of the original energy strategy will be followed. The changes to the\rthermal performance within Phase 1 and the proposed updated energy strategy for Phase 2 will result in large\rCO2 reductions and increased air quality. It will also mean the entire site is compliant with the latest GLA\rpolicy.\r\rOfficer comment: The sustainability issues in relation to the energy centre have been set out above. No objection is raised in this regard.",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site is located on the Winery Lane Estate and relates to the residential block known as Acropolis House. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The site is not located in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not listed.\r\r42x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one objection has been received, which highlights the following concerns:-\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\"The current proposal does not include replacement of the existing external doors which constitutes an inappropriate and unacceptable design flaw. The current design, whilst \"rundown and unattractive\", is uniform in its use of timber for all external openings. Replacing only part of this structure will still leave the building in a state of disrepair with unmatched openings that do not \"upgrade thermal performance\" and do not \"greatly improve the security of the building\". I propose this planning application be denied until the proposal includes replacement of the doors with a significantly more secure and thermal option which will also match the design of the windows.\"\rCase Officer Response:-\rAs a result of the proposed replacement of the existing brown single-glazed timber casement windows with brown double-glazed uPVC casement windows, the existing external doors remaining in place, is acceptable. The site is not located in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not listed. A condition is recommended to govern the depth of the reveals between the window frames and the external elevation walls. Double-glazed windows will greatly improve the security of the building, minimising any risk for residents occupying the flats. The thermal performance of the uPVC double-glazed windows, will be considered against the requirements of approved document L- (Conservation of Fuel and Power), by Kingston Building Control.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \rOfficer Comment: Planning permission is sought for the replacement of the existing brown single-glazed timber casement windows with brown double-glazed uPVC casement windows. The overall design and brown colour of the replacement windows, are acceptable in this location. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the nature of the proposed works, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to loss of privacy. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey rear extension would have a depth that is in excess of the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013, the proposal would have an appropriate height and as such would appear as a modest addition to the host property and surrounding area.\r\rThe proposal would include a first floor rear infill extension and raise the ridge of the existing roof slope by 1.3m. While the proposed first floor rear extension would be separated from the shared boundary and would continue the roof form of the existing roof slope, officers consider that the raised ridge with rear infill extension would add significant bulk to the host property. Further, given that there are no similar extensions in the immediate area, and that the applicant has not demonstrated how the extension in ridge height would appear within the immediate vicinity, officers consider that it would appear an incongruous addition that would detract from the appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proposed increase in ridge height and proximity of the first floor rear extension to the closest habitable window at first floor level at No. 67 and 71 Kings Road, officers consider that the proposed extension would adversely affect the amenities of No.69 and No.71 Kings Road, by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light.\r\rWhile openings are proposed at first and second floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy officers consider that a condition could be imposed in the event of an approval to ensure that the openings are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
