    "By virtue of excessive size, bulk and mass, the proposed rear dormer extension would fail to appear as subservient addition. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area contrary, to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013). \r",
    "Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor flat of a 3 storey late Victorian/Edwardian building that has been converted into 4 flats, located on the corner of Lovelace Road and Lovelace Gardens.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints, however, it is located adjacent and opposite to, areas with blanket Tree Preservation Orders.\r\r65 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and one representation has been received objecting to the proposal on the following grounds:\r-The replacement of the Goat Willow tree with 2 or 3 new trees is vague. Firm assurances are requested to ensure exact number and species of tree are confirmed and then planted. \rThese matters will be addressed later in this report.\r\rRBK Trees and Landscape officer: No response.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r-Character and Design; \r-Impact on trees; and,\r-Impact on neighbour amenity,\r\rCharacter and Design \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers Comment: The proposed development is a modest extension and would be subordinate and proportionate in relation to the host building.  The proposed materials would match the existing with a compatible roof form and fenestration details to remain in keeping with the host building. It is considered acceptable by reason of its design, siting, scale, design and materials and in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rTrees\rPolicy guidance 7 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013 states that where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that:\r-The tree is in poor health\r-Two replacement trees can be planted on-site (2 for 1 policy)\r-As per London Plan requirements, new planting should follow the 'right place, right tree, principle.\r\rThe proposal seeks the removal of a mature Goat Willow tree as it could be affected by the foundations of the proposed extensions. Officers note the tree provides some visual amenity and screening of the property to Lovelace Road, however, the tree is not protected by a TPO and the site is not located within a Conservation Area. In the event of an approval and subject to the satisfaction of a condition requiring a detailed landscaping plan (including replacement trees) officers consider that the impact on visual amenity would be acceptable.\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer's comment: The proposed extension would be modest, proportionate and subordinate in relation to the host building and would be set well away from the nearest residential neighbours. It would therefore not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties and is in accordance with Policy DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
