    "The development complies with the criteria set out in Schedule 2, Part, 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace 3 storey town house. The site is covered by a blanket Tree Protection order (TPO) but officers note there are no trees within the proposed development area that would be affected.\r\rProposal\rErection of first floor and second floor side extension and erection of single storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\r20 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed first floor side extension would unbalance the terrace visually but due to the existing ground floor side extension, consider that the proposed first floor extension would improve the current situation. Officers also note there is a variation in the building typology within the streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the seperation distance between No. 25 The Avenue and No. 27 The Avenue, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed roof plans of outbuilding at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work.\r\rThe stated scale in the submitted roof plan is 1:100, but the provided scale bar does not measure to 1:100."
