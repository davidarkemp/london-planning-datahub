    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The application site is located in the Presburg Road Conservation Area.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rMalden and Coombe CAAC - no objection \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on the Presburg Road Conservation Area.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 20/02877/HOU. The principal issue with the refused application was the proposed materials on the front, side and rear fenestrations, which would have resulted in harm to the character and appearance of the Presburg Road Conservation Area. The proposed materials within the current proposal have been amended to be in keeping with the host property, thereby addressing this issue. \r\rWhile the single storey extension would not strictly accord with the recommendations set by the Residential Design SPD, given its modest height and the presence of other single storey garages within the immediate streetscene, it would appear an appropriate addition to the host property and would be in keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rThe single storey rear extension would also not comply with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD with regards to the height and depth, however, it would match the depth of the rear building line of the adjoining property, and as such would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer would be modest in scale and form, and the proposed rooflights to the front/side and rear roof slopes would be of a similar size to the adjoining property, and are considered acceptable subject to them being \"conservation area\" style rooflights which could be secured via condition in the event of approval. As such the proposed developments to the roof would appear in keeping with the character of the surrounding area and would be an appropriate addition to the host property.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the scale and siting of the proposal in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site is located within the Presburg Road Conservation Area. The significance of this area can be summarised as a small group of Queen Anne Revival style houses built between 1903-1908 by Vincent Davison. The application property makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area as an attractive and relatively well preserved example of Queen Anne Revival style houses.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of Presburg Road Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. As previously mentioned, the proposed extensions and alterations would be in keeping with features of the original house and the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a two-storey detached dwelling located on the south side of Grove Lane, which is a well-established residential area. The property is not listed although it is within the Grove Crescent Conservation Area. To the east of the site is St John Parish Hall and on the opposite side is a vacant plot of land, beyond which is no. 4 Grove Lane. The property has been extended from its original form with the addition of a single storey extension to the side and a conservatory at the rear.\r\rThe planning history relevant to this application is:\r20/03004/HOU - Demolition of existing rear conservatory followed by the erection of a flat roof single storey rear extension, spiral staircase and roof terrace with associated changes to fenestration. Erection of mezzanine floor with chimney stack removal and installation of 6no rooflights - refused March 2021\r\r19/00057/HOU - Erection of first floor side extension - granted June 2019\r\r19/00056/HOU - Demolition of existing rear conservatory followed by the erection of a pitched roof rear extension.  Existing openings alteration and installation of new side and rear windows on ground floor - granted June 2019\r\r5 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and no responses were received following the consultation period.\r\rThe following consultation was undertaken:\rKingston Town CAAC - No objection \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r                                             \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rThe proposal involves the creation of a mezzanine floor following the lowering of the level of the loft space within the property. As internal works, this would not require planning permission and so there can be no objection. The installation of rooflights formed part of planning ref. 20/03004/HOU along with a number of other alterations to the property. Whilst this application was refused, their installation was not raised as a concern, though the current proposal increases the number from four to six. The additional rooflights will be of an appropriate size and well-positioned, so that they do not dominate the roofslope or create a cluttered appearance. As such, the character and appearance of the original property and the surrounding conservation area would be preserved. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rDue to the positioning within the roofslope, it is not considered that the rooflights would give rise to concerns regarding any overlooking of neighbouring properties, and so an acceptable relationship would be maintained. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
