    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi-detached house.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the demolition of the existing conservatory and the erection of a single-storey rear extension.\r\rRepresentations\r6x surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. 2x letters of objection have been received from one address and the following concerns highlighted:-\rComment Reasons: \"Excessive height or bulk of buildings and Loss of light/Sunlight.\rThe planning and building of the proposed extension to the rear of 21 Raleigh Drive is objected to for the following reasons. Research has shown there is a right to light law where if a land or property owner has enjoyed light through defined apertures of a building for an uninterrupted period of 20 years objections can be made for the proposed structure to be reduced in size and bulk It is requested that the proposed new extension be reduced in length to 3mtrs and a pitched roof height of 3.5 metres at its highest point of abutment to the rear of the property and constructed 300mm, or more within the boundary fence. This would maintain the uninterrupted light levels of the adjoining building.\"\rComment Reasons: \"Effects on trees, Excessive height or bulk of buildings and Loss of light/Sunlight. The planning and building permission is objected for the following reasons set out below\r1: the applicant has failed to state in section 9 of the planning application form there is 2 mature oak trees with tpo's both trees are in the rear garden of the adjoining property 19 Raleigh Drive both trees are in falling distance of the proposed extension the roots from these trees would extend towards the proposed extension and damage to the roots from excavation is very likely.\r2: the proposed extension would extend 5mts away from the main structure building being 21 Raleigh Drive the length and height of this proposed structure would inhibit daylight into the ground floor living room area of 19A Raleigh Drive also in autumn and winter when winds are more high the patio area of 19A Raleigh drive becomes a vortex sweeping tree debris into this area with the proposed extension height and length this would increase this vortex 5 fold because of the 5 metre length of the extension\r3: In the submitted document 21/02096/HOU 01 the foot note mentions the party wall agreement act it is my believe this may not be adhered the submitted drawings show the proposed extension structure on or up to the properties boundary line excavation and erecting of scaffolding and construction would require removing 6mtrs of the boundary line fence this boundary line fence is the property of and liability of 19 Raleigh Drive also damage would be incurred to the patio of 19 Raleigh Drive as 2 concrete fence post would also have to be removed for excavation so as to maintain the existing boundary line fence and no damage to the patio area of 19 Raleigh Drive any new construction be constructed a minimum of 300mm or more inside the boundary line and not as shown on the submitted drawing up to and on the boundary. It is requested a site visit be made by planning and building control to view the objection reasons this would give a clear understanding of the objections raised.\"\rOfficer Response: Following the submission of the current planning application, the applicant has submitted a BS5837 Arboricultural Impact Assessment, dated November 2021, which has been reviewed by and commented upon, by the Tree Officer below. Issues relating to any party wall, are a civil matter between neighbours and governed by the Party Wall Act 1996. All other issues highlighted above, are considered later within this report, insofar as they are related to town and country planning.\r\rTree Officer Comments:\rThe Arboricultural Method Statement & Tree Protection Plan the applicants have provided is sufficient and if planning permission is to be granted, then it should carry the condition of compliance with this document as submitted and approved.\r\rPlanning History\rNone recorded.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would not adhere to the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth. Officers consider that the proposal would conflict with policy guidance 8 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Given that the rear extension would abut the shared boundary with the adjoining property at no.19 Raleigh Drive and it would extend to a depth of 5 metres, which is further in depth than is recommended, officers consider that the proposed development would cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no.19 Raleigh Drive. In terms of loss of daylight and direct sunlight, the ground floor extension proposed, would project to the north-west and would be located to the north east of the rear of the adjoining property at no.19 Raleigh Drive. As a result of the location of the proposed extension, there would be no significant loss of daylight or direct sunlight caused to the adjoining property at no.19 Raleigh Drive. \r\rThe rear wall of the house at the neighbouring property at no.23 Raleigh Drive, is set to the rear of the main house at no.21 Raleigh Drive. As a result of this set back and the flank wall of the proposed extension being set away from the shared boundary with this neighbouring propert and there are  existing garages either side of the shared  boundary and a coal store to be removed,, the loss of amenities caused to no.23 Raleigh Drive, would not be significant enough to warrant refusal.\r",
