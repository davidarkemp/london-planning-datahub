    "The proposed extension by reason of its excessive depth would not relate well to the characcter and appearance of the main dwelling, or the adjacent properties, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD Adopted July 2013.",
    "By reason of its excessive depth the proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of neighbouring property No. 106 Richmond Road as it would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the principle window of the nearest ground floor habitable room, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing garage and erection of single-storey wrap around side and rear extension with flat roof and parapet walls.\r\rConsultation\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets - The Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed side extension is not in complete compliance with Policy Guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013 as it has not been set back from the front elevation by 500mm, but also note No. 167 & No. 171 Grand Drive already benefit from similar extensions. The symmetry between No. 164 and 162 Grand drive has already been disrupted due to the existing side extension at No. 162. The proposed development in this case is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Rather, the proposed side extension and demolition of existing garage would extend the separation distance between No. 166 and No. 164 Grand Drive and therefore be beneficial to neighbouring residential amenity in this regard.\r\rHeritage Assets                                                                                                             \rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off street car parking space. Whilst this would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue wold not warrant grounds for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. \r\rSustainable Travel\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided. Despite the loss of the garage and potential cycle storage therein, the application property and garden is of an adequate size to accommodate dedicated and secure cycle storage and access from the front of the property to the rear would be retained.  Therefore, the proposal is considered to achieve general compliance with Policy T5.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development has not been fully assessed in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. The plans provided do not accurately show the levels of the dwelling and therefore officers cannot accurately consider whether there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As mentioned above, the plans provided do not accurately show the levels of the dwelling and therefore officers cannot accurately assess the impact that the proposed rear extension would have upon the amenities of the neighbouring properties. As such, it cannot be determined that the proposed development would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, given the inconsistencies in the plans provided, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r",
