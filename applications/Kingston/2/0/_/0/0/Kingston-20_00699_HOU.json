    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The facing materials used in the development to which this permission relates shall match those of the existing building(s) unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at second floor level or above in the flank elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.

    "The site comprises a commercial unit located on the ground floor of a terraced property\r\rConsultations\r35 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rRBK Environmental Health - No objection.\rRBK Waste and Recycling - No response received.\rRBK Transport Officer - No response received.\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer - No objection.\r\rProposal\rPermission is south to vary Condition 1 (Approved Plans) of Planning Permission Ref: 20/03066/FUL (Proposed change of use from Use Class E(a) (formerly A1) Retail Supermarket to E(b) (formally A3) Restaurant and installation of extractor system to rear). Variation to include a change within the internal design to include the installation of a water fountain to the rear.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The principle of development;\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rPrinciple of development \rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established. \r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the granting of the original permission.\r\rThere has been no change in planning policy. The principle of the conversion is considered to be acceptable. Both retail and restaurant uses fall within Class E of the GPDO (as amended), meaning that the two uses can be interchangeable without the need to apply for planning permission. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed amendment would see changes to the approved seating area to the rear in order to incorporate an external garden and soft landscaping. The position of the flank wall nearest No. 146 High Street would also be set away from the shared boundary. The boundary to the rear woud also be modified. The proposed changes would increase the amount of glazing to the side and rear elevations. Officers consider that the proposals would improve the appearance of the original design approved under planning permission which would have otherwise resulted in a blank facade, and as such the proposals would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host premises and immediate surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed soft landscaping would consist of decorative planting, given that this would mainly consist of planted plants within a small area, officers are satisfied with the information provided.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above, the proposal would increase the amount of glazing to the side and rear elevations. However, given that the existing boundary treatment would reach 1.9m in height, it is considered that there would be no material increase in overlooking/loss of privacy to the occupiers of neighbouring properties and there would be no material increase in noise and or disturbance as a result of the proposal in comparison to the original consent.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC).\r\rThe site is also subject to a Tree Preservation Orders.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing garage. Erection of two-storey front and side extensions with associated changes to fenestration. Alterations to existing roof including raising ridge height. Installation of 2no front, 3no rear rooflights and 2no chimney stack removals.\r\rConsultations \r20 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and no representations were received.\rPlanning History\r\r21/00604/HOU - Demolition of existing garage. Erection of two-storey front and side extensions with associated changes to fenestration. Alterations to existing roof including raising ridge height, installation of 3no front, 3no rear rooflights and 2no chimney stack removals - Refused 07.05.2021.\rReasons for Refusal:\r\r1. The proposed development, by reason of its form, materials and detailed design, would appear highly incongruous within the Henley Drive street scene, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r2. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not cause unacceptable harm to trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\ro\tDesign and impact on heritage assets; and\ro\tImpact on neighbour amenity\ro\tImpact on trees\r\rDesign and impact on heritage assets\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficers Comment: This application is for the demolition of an existing garage and the erection of two-storey front and side extensions, roof alterations including raising the ridge height and the installation of rooflights and removal of chimney stack.\r\rA large front extension is proposed extending 2.8m to the side of the existing dwelling and approximately 11m along the boundary with the neighbour to the north. The extension/gable is set down from the ridge of the building which in itself has been raised by approximately 0.6m. \r\rThe previous application (21/00604/HOU) was refused on the basis that the form, materials and detailed design, would appear highly incongruous within the Henley Drive street scene. The officer report specifically referenced the unusual nature of the roof extensions, particularly the introduction of a secondary front roof slope with a flat roof that would extend across approximately half of the front elevation, terminating in a form of gable end towards the southern flank of the building. \r\rThe secondary roof slope has been omitted from this application and the two front extensions are now gable ended extensions that extend from the main roof line (as extended). This gives the appearance of subordinate extensions that are compatible with the main roof form and surrounding area. \r\rThere are no examples of buildings in the area with three front gables, however, this is accepted on the basis of the stepped nature of the extensions and the variation of materials and height (in relation to each other and the main building) which will allow them to be read separately and be seen as proportionate additions.\r\rThe side extension to the buildings extends towards the neighbouring property to the north but adequate separation distance is maintained. The ridge height of the building is increased / altered slightly but this is considered compatible with neighbouring buildings and the wider area.\r\rConcern was previously raised in relation to the materials, namely the unusual mix of white render, black render and red brick. In this case, a mix of white render, wood cladding and red brick is proposed. The white render, red brick and wood cladding are consistent with the existing building and neighbouring buildings which is accepted. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development is acceptable by reason of its form, materials and detailed design, and is compatible with the the Henley Drive street scene, character and appearance of the area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill SASC. The proposal is therefore in accordance with policies of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbour Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer's comment: Given the relationship between the application property and its neighbours, as well as the degree of separation between the proposed extensions and the boundaries of the site, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would not appear overbearing or result in any materially harmful loss of light for neighbouring occupiers. The proposed fenestration would offer similar views to the existing and therefore officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any undue loss of privacy for neighbouring occupiers. \r\rThe proposal is therefore in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and the Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rImpact on Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected. \r\rThe site is subject to two tree preservation orders and contains a number of mature trees.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Tree Survey, Arboricultural Method Assessment, Arboricultural Impact Assessment and a Tree Protection Plan.\r\rThe Council's Tree Officer has raised a query in relation to the tree protection for a nearby Oak but has confirmed that this can be dealt with by a pre-commencement condition securing further details of tree protection.\r\rSubject to this conditions, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Berrylands. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development;\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey extension to the front of the property to facilitate a porch, as well as the construction of a first floor extension to the rear. Both extensions would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, as well as both respecting the existing roof form of the property. The proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the application partly proposes the construction of a single storey extension to the front of the property, the existing parking provision will remain the same. As such the proposal would comply with local car parking standards and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
