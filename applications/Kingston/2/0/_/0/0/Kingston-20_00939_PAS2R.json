    "The proposed change of use of part of the first floor from light industrial (Class B1c) to 9 flats (Class C3) does not fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class PA.1. (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). It is considered that the building was not used solely for a light industrial use on 19th March 2014 or, in the case of a building which was in use before that date but was not in use on that date, when it was last in use.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located on the south western side of King Charles Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal relates to the conversion of the garage into habitable space, the erection of a new porch, a part two storey, part single storey rear, first floor box window extension, alteration to fenestration and a dropped kerb.\r\rConsultation\r5 surrounding properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Highway Engineer - No Highways objections in principle. However, the drawings submitted do not show a sufficient level of detail to determine whether the extended crossover could be achieved, based on the RBK Crossover Policy. Should planning approval be granted the applicant will need to apply for the crossover, at which time a site survey will be undertaken to confirm whether or not such an extension is permissible.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on transport and highways.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to varying front building lines along King Charles Road, the proposed front porch is considered not to have a detrimental effect upon the character and appearance of the area. The proposed rear extensions would not be visible from the street. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  In relation to neighbouring amenity the principal properties to be considered are No. 166 and No. 170 King Charles Road. With regards to No. 170 Officers note that the proposed rear elevation would now be the same depth, so it is not considered to cause harm. Officers acknowledge that the proposed first floor rear extension may cause some loss of light to No. 166, however, due to the separation distance between the properties, this loss of light would not be detrimental enough to warrant a refusal.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. With regards to loss of cycle parking in the garage, access to the rear of the property has been maintained so it is possible to provide alternative storage within the rear garden.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed floor plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged.\r\rThe submitted floor plans do not have a North point."
