    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it. \r\rThis application seeks a non-material amendment to facilitate the relocation of plant  to the roof of the consented 2 storey infill extension, with associated ducting on the roof of the two storey extension extension.The height of  the plant on the roof of the infill extension would be  beneath the height of the consented parapet wall. The ducting on the roof of the entrance extension would largely be concealed behind the approved parapet, but with a small element circa.100 mm shown to project above the parapet. It is noted that at its closest point this element  is setback circa. 1 metre from the edge of the roof and behind the approved stair.  3D modelling demonstrates that the plant would not be visible from the public realm, being concealed  by the approved parapets and  existing building structures.  The plant would be located within a central part of the College site. \r\rIt is noted that the application 19/02368/FUL as originally submitted proposed the plant in a similar layout and roof top location, and changed during the course of the application as a result of amendments sought in relation to comments made by the  Environment Agency. However, these comments related to the detailed layout of the ground floor, the provision of void space to accommodate flood waters and would remain unaffected by this proposal.\r\rThe original permission (19/02368/FUL) includes a condition to restrict noise emission from any plant (condition number 8) to protect residential amenity.  The applicant has confirmed that the current proposal has been reviewed by an Acoustician, who has confirmed that the plant would be designed to comply with condition 8  related to plant noise (5Dba below background) without the need for extra screening.  An additional condition is  included to ensure no unreasonable noise disturbance is caused to neighbouring non-residential development, as recommended by the Environmental Protection Officer. \r\rIn these circumstances, it is accepted that the proposed amendments are non-material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment be granted subject to the additional conditions set out above.",
    "The applicant is reminded that Condition 8 of Planning Permission 19/02368/FUL  requires that the rating level of the noise determined by the cumulative sound emissions of the plant to which this permission relates shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation. The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade and the measurements and assessment shall be made according to BS 4142:2014.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed floor plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works. The plans must also show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is encouraged.\r\rThe submitted floor plans do not have a North point.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed roof plans at a recognised scale (at 1:50 or 1:100 for example), showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. The plans must show the direction of North. Although the inclusion of a scale bar is not mandatory, it is highly encouraged.\r\r",
    "Please be advised this application cannot be considered as a free-go resubmission, as the previously submitted application is yet to be determined. You can either withdraw the previous application, or pay a fee for this application, of £206"
