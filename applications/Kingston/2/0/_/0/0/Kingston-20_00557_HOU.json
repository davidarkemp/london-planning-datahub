    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The finished floor levels of the development to which this permission relates shall be no lower than those of the existing building(s) and any electrical sockets or other electrical fittings within the development shall be installed no lower than 450mm above finished floor level.\r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations objection have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would have a modest footprint in relation to the dwelling, and neighbouring properties. Whilst the roof form would be flat, it would not be visible from the street and would be in keeping with the roof profile of the ground floor extension below. The site is not located in a Conservation Area.  As such, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property with an acceptable impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevations of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. It has also been demonstrated that the proposed development would meet the 45 degree daylight/sunlight criteria of the Residential Design SPD 2013. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed internal elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rThe submitted internal elevations are not labelled as existing or proposed."
