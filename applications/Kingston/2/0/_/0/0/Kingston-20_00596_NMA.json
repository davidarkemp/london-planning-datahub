    "Due to the nature of the proposed amendments, the Grade II Listing of the building and the trees at the site being subject to a Tree Preservation Order, it is considered that the proposal would not constitute a non-material amendment.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the\rbenefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r",
    "Please provide a revised copy of block scaled 1:500/1:200 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rPlease note the submitted block plan does not scale correctly at the scale given."
