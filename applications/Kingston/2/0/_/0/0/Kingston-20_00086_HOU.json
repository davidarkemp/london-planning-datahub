    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site relates to a first floor flat, located within a two storey end of terrace property on the corner of Villers Road and Lower Marsh Lane. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a side dormer roof extension with installation of 2no rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r\r15 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received. One response was received from the neighbouring property at No.175 Villiers Road.\r\rThe representation raised questions regarding the proposed development and window the rear dormer. In particular, if it would prevent No.175 from developing their property and if the proposed window would be blocked.\r\rAny proposed development at the neighbouring property would be considered on its own merits. In terms of the window, whilst it would serve a stairway, a condition attached to the permission would ensure the window is obscured and fixed below 1.7m. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSide Dormer \r\rThe proposed side dormer would be located on the north elevation of the building, protecting its most visible roof form to the front corner of the property. Whilst still visible from Villiers Road, the dormer is modest in scale, set back from the front elevation and the main the ridge line and will utilise materials to match the host building.  The proposed roof lights have been designed in accordance with the SPD policy guidance and considered satisfactory.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThere is one window proposed to the side elevation of the dormer that would serve an internal stairway. To ensure protection of neighbouring amenities to No.175 Villiers Road, a condition will require the window to be obscure glazed and fixed up to 1.7m above internal floor level. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r",

    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service.

No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issue in the assessment of the application is the impact on the listed chapel building.\r\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe significance of the listed building is as a gothic cemetery chapel dating from 1855. It is the focal point of Kingston Cemetery, which is a typical example of a \"garden cemetery\", a popular type of cemetery design in the Victorian era.\r\rThe chapel building is actually laid out as twin chapels straddling a carriageway, with connecting stone arches and spire above. The western chapel was originally for members of the Church of England, with the eastern chapel for non-conformists. The western chapel is now a remembrance chapel and the eastern chapel is a flower room.\r\rThe eastern chapel has suffered structural movement, resulting in the appearance of large cracks and the north-eastern corner, over the northern bay window and at the south-eastern corner. A raking shore has been placed against the northern elevation in an attempt to arrest the movement of the building. Subsequent movement has necessitated the installation of internal propping. The building is closed to the public because of its structural condition.\r\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of the existing floor slab and subsequent construction of 15no. augered piles and new floor slab. The northern end of the eastern wall would be dismantled and rebuilt, with other fractures repaired using HeliBars. \r\rThe existing floor slab is a modern concrete construction and its demolition would not result in the loss of any historic fabric. Its replacement would also be of a modern concrete construction and its finish would represent the only change to the appearance of the building. All other elements of the building would be dismantled, stored and reused as far as possible, with any repairs or replacements to be on a like-for-like basis. \r\rIn light of the fact that the only loss or alteration associated with the proposal would concern the modern floor, officers consider that the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of the listed building. It is therefore not necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal, although officers would point out that they are considerable, since the proposal would ensure the survival of the building and bring it back into public use.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that listed building consent be granted.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",

The material issues raised are summarised as follows:\r\r- Loss of light; and,\r- External finishes.\r\r1 neutral comment was also received, raising concerns about the use of the property.\r\rThe issues raised will be considered below.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed development would involve extending the existing hipped roof out to form a gable. Paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area.\r\rThe application property forms one half of a pair of semi-detached properties, both of which retain their original, steeply sloping hipped roofs. The proposal would therefore be at odds with the existing character of the property and would upset the visual balance with its adjoining semi-detached neighbour. It would also be at odds with surrounding development, since the properties on Burlington Road generally have either retained their existing hipped roofs or were originally designed with gables.\r\rAccording to Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD, dormer windows should be designed so that they are set down from the ridge of the roof by at least 500mm and set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by the same amount. They should complement the character of the existing property, align with any windows below, and not be built in the style of a mansard.\r\rIn this case, the dormer would be appropriately set down from the ridge and in from the sides and eaves of the roof. However, it would be unusually large in scale because the property has a cat-slide roof to the rear, which the dormer would extend over. Although the proposed box form is typical, it would not complement the character of the existing house and it would be readily visible from Walton Avenue (to the east).\r\rIn light of the above, officers consider that the proposed development, by reason of its scale, form and siting, would upset the visual balance with No. 24 Burlington Road and would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Walton Avenue street scene, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rAlthough the dormer would be large in scale, its siting atop the existing roof slope would be such that it would not appear overbearing. While it would limit the amount of natural light reaching the rear roof lights at No. 24 Burlington Road, officers consider that this would not be so significant as to amount to material harm, having regard to the height and position of the dormer relative to the roof lights. The impact on No.28 Burlington Road in terms of natural light would be much more limited owing to the degree of separation between this property and the development.\r\rThe proposed fenestration would offer similar views to the existing fenestration. In light of this, the proposed development would not unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of privacy.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rOther Matters\rOfficers note that neighbouring residents have expressed concerns over whether the property is in use as a house in multiple occupation, but no compelling evidence has been put forward that would lead officers to take this view in assessing the current application.\r\rOfficers also note that the submitted proposed elevations (drawing 21129_305) do not show the proposed hip-to-gable conversion. Notwithstanding the assessment above, it would be remiss of officers to recommend approval of the application on the basis of incomplete and conflicting drawings.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development, by reason of its scale, form and siting, would upset the visual balance with No. 24 Burlington Road and would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Walton Avenue street scene, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe only benefits of the proposal are those very limited, private benefits associated with providing additional living accommodation at the property.\r\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable. This is a neutral matter.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers recommend that planning permission be refused.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
