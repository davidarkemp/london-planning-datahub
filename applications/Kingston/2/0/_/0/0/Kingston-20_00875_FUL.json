No comments received under this re-consultation exercise)\r\rOfficer Comment: Duly noted. Please refer to body of report for full assessment of the proposals and impact upon neighbouring amenity. A condition would be attached to any grant of permission requiring swift boxes/bricks.\r\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and \r- The impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rCharacter & Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 38 (Front Extensions) of the Residential Design Guide, 2013 states that the following guidance will apply: \r-\tFront extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window. \r-\tNew porches should reflect the character of the main house, appear as part of the original building and not be an obvious addition. \r-\tPorches should be designed to be subordinate to the existing house and should not dominate the front elevation. \r-\tThe roof of the porch should match the design and pitch of the roof of the existing house. \r-\tAll front extensions should be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties. \r-\tFront extensions that extend across the entire frontage are unlikely to be supported. \r-\tFront extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on site.\r\rOfficer comments - A 6m deep x 2m wide front porch is proposed. The porch is considered to be an appropriate addition in terms of scale and design and would not dominate the front elevation.\r\rPolicy Guidance 36 (Two Storey Side Extensions) of the Residential Design Guide, 2013 states that:\r-\tThe extension should remain subordinate to the original house; \r-\tThe roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form;\r-\tFlat roofs should generally be avoided unless they are consistent with the form of the existing building's roof; \r-\tCare should be taken to retain characteristic gaps between houses to prevent them from combining visually to form a 'terrace' (see Figure 38 above); \r-\tFeatures such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house in terms of their style and positioning; \r-\tThe line of the roof's eaves should run with that of the original dwelling; \r-\tBalconies will generally not be acceptable, particularly where they may give rise to overlooking; \r-\tA minimum distance of 15m shall be maintained between a primary elevation of an existing house and the flank wall of a proposed two-storey side extension; and, \r-\tA minimum distance of 21m shall be maintained between habitable room windows of neighbouring properties.\r\rOn detached properties: \r-\tthe roof line of the side extensions should either follow that of the existing roof or be set down from that of the main house by a minimum of 500mm, and \r-\tthe extension should either be designed so that it appears as an integral part of the existing house, or where appropriate, set back from the front wall of the existing house by a minimum of 1m.\r\rPolicy Guidance 34 (Two Storey Rear Extensions) of the Residential Design Guide, 2013 advises that two storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling. \r-\tAdequate separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained\r-\tAdequate daylighting and sunlighting of neighbouring properties should be maintained using the 45 and 25 degree principles discussed above. \r-\tOn narrow width properties - particularly terraced properties, two storey rear extensions are unlikely to be appropriate as they often result in an unreasonable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook for adjoining properties.\r-\tThe roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof and should not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof. \r-\tThe roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the 2nd floor. \r-\tFlat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building, and the use of a flat roof for a roof terrace or balcony at two-storey height will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the erection of a two-storey side and rear extension. \r\rThe rear extension element would be 3.4m in depth from the original rear building line and span the full width of the dwelling at ground floor, with the first floor extending to a width of 6.8m with a set in of 3.2m from the edge of the dwelling (adjacent to the boundary with No. 14 Minstead Way). The single-storey rear extension element would feature a pitched roof with a height between 2.7m and 3.5m, with a flush fitting rooflight.\r\rThe extensions broadly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, and would also appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. The first floor extension would set-back from the front elevation by approximately 1m. The side extension would also be set in from the side boundary by 1m. The overall scale and siting is, on balance, considered to be acceptable and would not have a detrimental impact on the host property or character and appearance in the streetscene. \r\rOfficers therefore consider that, on balance, this element of the proposal would also have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse.  \r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider in relation to amenity would be the adjacent properties at No's 10 and 14 Minstead Way. \r\rThe proposed rear extensions would bring the application property in line with the rear building line at No. 14 Minstead Way.\r\rWhilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed extensions would increase the footprint of the building both in terms of depth and width, it is considered that the resultant dwellinghouse would remain proportionate to its plot and not create a harmful impact upon the wider streetscene. Furthermore, due to its scale and siting in relation to the neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an overbearing impact to No. 10 Minstead Way. \r\rDue to the orientation of the application property, the proposed extensions are not considered to result in materially harmful impact to sunlight to the habitable rooms or external rear garden space of No. 10 Minstead Way. The proposed side extension would result in a gap of approximately 4.3m between the built form of the application property and No. 10. No side facing windows are proposed, aside from one first floor window serving a bathroom which would be conditioned as obscure-glazed and, so, it is not considered to impact upon privacy towards this neighbouring property, and the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to neihgbouring amenity, the proposed rear element of the extension has been set in from the adjoining boundary with No. 109 Surbiton Hill Park to reduce any possible loss of daylight/sunlight. Due to the proposed pitched roof and limited depth, the proposed works are considered compliant with the relevant BRE guidance with regards to the 45 degree rule.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a flat/semi-detached/linked/detached dwelling.\r\rRelevant History\rOn 12 February 2013, planning permission was granted for: \"Refurbishment and extensions of existing retail store (Primark Nos 70-76) to provide a four storey retail building, with basement and roof level plant, including the demolition and redevelopment of 78 Eden Street (Friends Meeting House)\".\rThe planning permission is subject to Minor Material Amendments ('MMA') relative to Condition 2 (Approved Drawings) and Condition 8 (Windows) approved on 13 July 2016 and 12 February 2019 (refs: 16/12351/FUL and 18/12568/FUL). \r\rCondition 11 of the original Planning Permission (ref: 12/12754/FUL) (which is repeated in Conditions 11 and 8 of the subsequent MMA approvals) requires the following:\r\"Deliveries to the site and servicing shall only take place between 7am and 8pm Mondays to Saturdays. There shall be no deliveries or servicing on Sundays and Bank Holidays.\"\r\rNon-material amendment (NMA) applications to vary Condition 11 to relax the delivery restrictions on Bank Holidays between Christmas and New Year 2021 and 2022/23 and Jubilee Bank Holidays in June 2022 were approved in December 2022, January 2023 and June 2022 respectively (refs: 21/03818/NMA, 22/03705/NMA and 22/01629/NMA). (It was necessary to undertake deliveries on\rBank Holidays as substitute or additional bank holidays would have affected supplies within the Primark retail store  due to the restriction causing consecutive days of no delivery). \r\rProposal\rThis application seeks a variation of Condition 11 (thereby Condition 8 of MMA Permission Ref: 18/12568/FUL) to relax the delivery restrictions on bank holidays, as follows:\r\"Deliveries to the site and servicing shall only take place between 7am and 8pm Mondays to Saturdays and between 10am and 4pm on Bank Holidays. There shall be no deliveries or servicing on Sundays.\"\r\rIn support of the application it is advised that the business requires flexibility to undertake deliveries on bank holidays, as there will\ralways be two consecutive days of no deliveries on the day after the bank holiday weekend. Such flexibility will also allow the store to respond to changing circumstances and store requirements efficiently without applying for an amendment to Condition 11 each time. \r\rConsultation\rThe proposal was advertised by site and press  notice.\rIndividual notification letters were sent to 33 neighbouring properties and no response received\rEnvironmental Health Pollution Control team: No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key area of assessment is:\r- Impact on residential amenity.\r\rResidential Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: The service yard for Primark is located to the rear of the store, accessed from Lady Booth Road. There are residential flats adjacent the service yard in Caversham House. \r\rThe application has been advertised by site and press notice and by individual notification letters, and no response has been received. \r\rOfficers  note that on bank holidays, Primark is willing to work within a reduced delivery window between 10am and 4pm, avoiding\rdeliveries on anti-social hours. In addition, it is advised that the store's requirement is 2-3 deliveries per day on bank holidays.  Subject to securing these reduced houses, and a maximum of 3 deliveries on Bank Holidays, officers consider that residential amenity is adequately safeguarded in this central town centre location, whilst allowing the existing business to operate efficiently. \r\rIt is recommended to amend condition 8, as follows:\rDeliveries to the site and servicing shall only take place between 7am and 8pm Mondays to Saturdays and between 10am and 4pm on Bank Holidays (with a maximum of 3 deliveries on any Bank Holiday). There shall be no deliveries or servicing on Sundays. \r\rAdditionally, it is noted that Condition 9 requires considerate deliveries practices are to be implemented at all times.\r\rIn conclusion, subject to amended condition 8,  it  is considered that the proposed development would not significantly adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of noise or disturbance.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
