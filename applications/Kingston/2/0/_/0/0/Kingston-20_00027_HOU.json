    "The roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the approved drawings, within three months of the date of this consent, the first floor side window in the north-western elevation of the hereby permitted development shall be replaced with a window so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.   \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The ground floor side windows fitted in the north-western elevation of the development hereby approved shall be  fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.   \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the north-western or south-eastern walls of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r16x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3x representations have been received, which highlight the following concerns:-\r- The loft extension will violate privacy\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car park issues\r- Fumes\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rMatters of impact on amenity are addressed below. Issues regarding to noise could be addressed by condition if needed. There is no reason to conclude that fumes would be an issues, and the development would not materially increase in the size of the dwelling so no issues with regards to car parking would be envisaged. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear dormer roof extension, would not be set down from the ridge line of the original roofslope and would not be set in from the sides and eaves of the original roof, contrary to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD. Given the unusual form of the proposed rear dormer roof extension, officers consider the proposal would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling and would appear as an incongruous addition within the immediate surrounding area.  \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the nature of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. There are existing rear first floor windows to habitable rooms at the host property. As a result of these windows, the proposed dormer would not cause increased  overlooking or loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, significant enough to warrant refusal.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Res\r",
