    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two-storey semi detached dwelling  and an outbuilding situated at the end of the rear garden.\rThe site is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the addition of a dual pitched roof to an existing outbuilding.\rOf relevance is planning application ref. no. 17/16257/HOU for Addition of pitched roof to existing outbuilding and dismissed appeal ref. no. APP/Z5630/D/173181587. \r\rConsultation\r8 Neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 letters have been received regarding the following summarised concerns:\r- Excessive height of bulk of building\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Loss of privacy\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing outbuilding with a flat roof is approx. 2.5m high and it is situated approx. 1m below ground level of the host dwelling. Its width (approx. 6m) and length (approx. 8.3m) would not be changed. \r\rThe proposed pitched roof would add approx. 1.5m in height, bringing the total height to approx. 4m. \r\rConsidering the difference in ground level, while the proposal would appear proportionate in scale in relation to the host dwelling, it would seem dominating when viewed from the properties located to the rear on the lover ground level and from the adjoining property No. 103 Beresford Avenue. \r\rIt is noted that neighbouring outbuildings are much smaller in scale when compared to the proposal. \r\rWhile the existing trees would provide some screening, it is considered that it would not be sufficient in order to minimise the impact on the character and appearence of the area. \r\rOfficer's note application  ref. no. 17/16257/HOU for addition of a pitched roof approx. half a metre higher than the existing proposal. It is noted that the appeal ref no APP/Z5630/D/173181587 in relation to 17/16257/HOU was dismissed as it was found that the proposal would result in material harm to character and appearance of the area as \"the increased height would create a more visually imposing building, which would appear incongruous and unduly prominent within this garden setting between two rows of dwellings\".\r\rWhile the current proposal would be approx. 0.5m lower when compared to application ref. no. 17/16257/HOU, due to the location of the outbuilding, limited set back from the property boundaries and scale of the existing neighbouring outbuildings, the proposal is very similiar to the scheme dismissed on appeal. Officers consider that the proposed outbuilding would appear incongruous and have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Although the proposal is considered to be of an excessive height it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance due to the siting of the proposal and size of the adjoining gardens. \r\rComments have been raised that the proposal would result in loss of light/sunlight and loss of privacy.\rIt is considered that due the siting of the proposal and small size of the proposed windows and its location, the proposal would not result in significant loss of light/sunlight and loss of privacy in relation to the adjoining properties.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been received related to:\r\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rInappropriate design/layout\rLoss of light/sunlight\rPrivacy\rNoise\rUnacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe proposal would not seek a change of use and as such officers consider the existing residential use to be acceptable. Further, officers do not consider that a residential use would result in the material increase in noise. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.)\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/02566/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the siting and depth of the proposed single storey rear extension. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in a dominant and incongruous development that would have appeared out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area. The proposal would no longer connect to the existing outbuilding, and would total 6m in depth, and while this would still be in excess of the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers note that the property benefits from prior approval for a similar sized extension ref: 21/03554/PAEXT, as such officers consider this holds credible fall back weight. In any case, officers note that similar extensions can be viewed in the immediate vicinity and as such would not appear out of keeping with the character and appearance of the surrounding area, thereby addressing this issue. \r\rThe proposed part single, part two storey side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the shared boundary at ground floor level, however it would have a modest width, and would be appropriately set in, set down and set back at first floor level, and as such would appear an appropriate addition to the host property, that would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above, the current proposal has reduced the depth of the proposed single storey rear extension, and as such officers consider that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance.\r\rFurther, given that the proposed rear and side extensions would pass the \"45-degree elevation test\" in relation to the closest habitable window on adjoining property 101 Beresford Avenue, and would pass the \"45-degree plan test\"  in relation to the closest habitable window on 99 Beresford Avenue, it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light/sunlight.\r\rThe proposal would not include side facing windows above first floor level, and as such, it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would result in the demolition of the existing detached garage to the rear of the dwelling. However, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage do not meet the modern day internal standards as set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. In any case the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be able to accommodate on-site parking in line with the policy requirements of the London Plan.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposal would include the loss of the existing garage, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that cycle parking is provided in the event of an approval.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling that has been divided into two flats.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension to ground floor flat (following demolition of existing porch and shed) with associated changes to fenestration\r\rNeighbour Notification\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rRelevant Planning History\rThe application has been submitted following the refusal of planning application ref: 21/02430/FUL which proposed a single strorey extension to the rear and was refused for the following reason:\r\rThe proposed extension, by reason of its depth, height and proximity to the shared boundary, would unduly result in an undue sense of enclosure to No. 68 South Lane and unacceptably limit the outlook from the principal window of the nearest ground floor habitable room at this property, thereby resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIn assessing the current planning application, Officers must consider whether the previous reason for refusal has been addressed.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would not be strictly in accordance with the Residential Design SPD (2013) guidance in relation to its depth, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main building. While the roof of the extension would be relatively unconventional, it would be situated to the rear and would not be highly prominent within the street scene. Overall, it is considered that the proposed extension would be of an acceptable character and design.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe previously refused application (ref: 21/02430/FUL) proposed an extension of approximately 5m in depth along the shared boundary with adjoining No. 68 South Lane (the boundary angles inwards from the No. 70A - No. 68). The extension had a parapet roof height of approximately 3.15m in height.\r\rThe current proposal has sought to address the previous reason for refusal by reducing the depth of the extension by approximately 0.5m to a maximum of 4.5m. The extension no longer follows the angled site boundary and now incorporates a maximum set-in from the site boundary of approximately 0.5m at the rear-most elevation. The extension retains a parapet roof but now incorporates a mono-pitch towards the shared boundary which results in a lower eaves height of approximately 2.5m.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the reduced height, depth and increased set-in from the site boundary is sufficient to address the previous reason for refusal and to ensure that there would be no unacceptable loss of outlook or undue sense of enclosure to No. 68 South Lane. The proposals are therefore considered to be acceptable in this regard.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIt is considered that the previous reason for refusal has been satisfactorily addressed and that the proposed single storey rear extension would be in general accordance with the Development Plan. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is granted.\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a  two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on 48 Upper Brighton Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints, however is on the boundary of the Southborough Conservation Area.\r\rConsultations\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee - 12/04/2022\r\rNo adverse impact on the conservation area.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension, as well as changes to the fenestration associated with the conversion of the garage in a habitable room. Whilst the proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the recommended height as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that it would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal would lead to the removal of an existing garage. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site. In any case, the site benefits from on-site parking to the front of the property.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
