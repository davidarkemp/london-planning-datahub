    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows in the flank elevation and situated on the first floor shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. The local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.",

The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
