    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r\rNo response received\r\rRelevant history \r\r23/01551/HOU - Erection of a single storey rear extension - refused\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rThe proposal is an amendment to planning application 23/01551/HOU. The principle change is a reduction in the depth from 6m (refused scheme)  to 5m (current proposal).\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rOn this occassion whilst the proposal does not follow the guiding principles of the LPA's Residential Design SPD as with the previous scheme 23/01551/HOU it is considered in the context of the site and surroundings that on balance the character and appearance of the proposed extension would be acceptable in terms of design and appearance as it would be in keeping with the general precedence set by neighbouring single storey extensions and be in keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the surrounding area.  \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal is an amendment to planning application 23/01551/HOU. The principle change is a reduction in the depth from 6m (refused scheme)  to 5m (current proposal). It is considered that the reduction in depth does not overcome the previous reasons for refusal under 23/01551/HOU. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light. It is considered that the proposed extension would result in an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties due to its depth added to its height along the party wall boundaries which would be to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. \r\rIn addition it is likely that the proposed extension would be likely to result in a loss of light to the neighbouring occupiers by reason of its depth added to the height of the proposed extension and its proximity to the boundary which would be detrimental to the neighbouring occupiers and the applicant has not submitted any evidence to the contrary\r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not result in an increase of overlooking of the neighbouring properties or result in a loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rLevels \r\rOfficers note there to be a change in levels on the site. Any future resubmission should clearly show external ground level, on any deposited drawings where applicable so as the change in levels is clear and to avoid any ambiguity.",
