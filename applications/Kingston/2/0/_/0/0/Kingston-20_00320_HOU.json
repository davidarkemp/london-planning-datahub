    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the building shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of glazed screen in roof and timber staircase enclosure. Raising parapet height\r\rConsultation\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified and 3 letters of support have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets - The Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. Appropriate forms of roof extension will depend on the style and character of the house on which it is proposed. \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: Roof extensions can have a significant impact on the character of the streetscape both in individual cases or through the cumulative impact of several roof extensions within a street. This is particularly true where they are visually prominent within the street. It is noted that the site falls within the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character (LASC), a non-designated heritage asset, the significance of which is derived from a distinctive area of \"moderne\" style 1930's semi detached properties. The area was the first significant development on Grand Avenue and is of consistent high quality with a variety of details associated with the style including tiled details around entrances. Windows with a strong horizontal emphasis with some original \"crittall\" windows remaining. Flat and pitched roofed pairs with a mix of brick and smooth rendered finish. \r\rAs it stands, it is considered that Nos. 168 to 146 have a group value which contributes positively towards the significance of the LASC. The proposed balustrading and shed type structure would be incongruous and erode the coherent appearance shared between Nos. 168 to 146, thereby eroding the positive contribution they make to the character and appearance of the area and the LASC. The proposed glazing and timber structure would be highly visible within the streetscene and would upset the symmetry of these semi detached properties. Overall it is considered that the proposed development would be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character and appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAs set out above, it is considered that there would be an adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is not considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Grand Avenue/Elmbridge Avenue Local Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed obscured glazed screen would be approximately 1.7m to the side elevations and 1.45m on the front and rear elevations. It is noted that roof terraces are not characteristic of this relatively low-density suburban area and it is considered that the newly introduced overlooking at the roof top level towards neighbouring properties would be unacceptable within this site specific context. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of privacy to neighbours.\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: No Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling situated within The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset).\r\rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for the erection of a single-storey rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r6x properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received for this application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rProposed rear extension:\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design with regards to recommended depths. However, given the size of the garden and the host dwelling, it is considered that the proposed extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \rwould work well for the proposal that combines traditional and modern elements. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rDue to the siting, scale and design of the proposed extensions and terrace, the size of the garden of the host dwelling, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in undue overlooking, overbearing appearance or loss of light or loss of privacy in relation to the adjoining properties.\r\r\rNon-Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application site falls within The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character which is a non-designated heritage asset. The proposed extensions and materials that also contain more contemporary elements are considered to relate well to the host dwelling. It is noted that proposed materials for the front and the north elevation are matching the existing. Furthermore, the features characteristic to The Berg Estate area would be retained and the key features of the existing front elevation would be replicated.  \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would  not result in harm to the significance of The Berg Estate Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other th\r",
