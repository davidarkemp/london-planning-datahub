    "Permitted development rights for extensions to the dwelling, including dormer windows, were withdrawn by condition 12 of 97/3406/FUL. Having regard to Article 3(4) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended), the proposed development would not therefore, be lawful.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension with installaton of new rooflights to existing rear roof\r\rConsultation\r8 Neighbouring properties have been notified and  no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed single storey rear extension would be approximately 4.8m in depth. Policy guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth but If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased. The proposed rear extension when compared to No. 52 High Drive would be considered overbearing in appearance.  Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment:. As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
