    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling located on the southern side of Gordon Road.\r\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single-storey rear/side extension and rear piggyback roof extension with installation of 6no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\r28x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received by the Council.  \r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer: No objection\r\rHistoric England: No comment\r\rPlanning History\rN/A\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would project 4.5 metres into the rear garden and would be slightly deeper than the existing flat roofed extension that it would replace. The proposed piggyback extension at roof level, would be setback in accordance with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013. The proposed extensions would be finished in materials that would be in keeping with the host dwelling. Overall, Officers consider the development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rWhilst the proposed ground floor rear extension would be slightly deeper than the extension that it would replace Officers note that the neighbouring properties at No.11 and No.13, each have existing rear extensions. As such and due to the existing pattern of development there would be no unacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of light, loss of privacy, overbearing, or overlooking. Whilst the proposed window at second floor level would afford some views over neighbouring gardens this would not be unacceptable or inconsidtent with the suburban pattern of development. As tot he \"piggy back\" roof extension the uproposed rooflights would not present any opportunity for undue overlooking or loss of privacy, subject to a condition regarding obscure glazing. Overall, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.  \r",
