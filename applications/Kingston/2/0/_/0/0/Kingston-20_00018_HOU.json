    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any rooflights at second floor level in the north-eastern elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the north-eastern elevation of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a terrace dwelling.\r\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections have been received relating to: \r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 20/02995/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was that the proposed development would have been an overbearing and dominant addition to the original dwelling. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in an unsympathetic development that would have resulted in an undue sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties which would be detrimental to the future living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. \r\rWhile the current proposal has reduced the proposed single storey rear/side extension to 4m in depth, this would still be over the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD for rear extensions (3 - 3.5m depth), and given the confined nature of the site, the proposed development would appear an overly dominant addition to the host property and unsympathetic development within the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would not contribute to a loss of light/sunlight, sense of overbearing or contribute to a loss of privacy for No. 80 Cleaveland Road. Given the constraints of the site, and that No. 76 Cleaveland Road only benefits from a partial rear extension, the proposed development would contribute to a loss of light/sunlight and sense of overbearing for neighbouring property No. 76 Cleveland Road. However, due to the fact that the proposed development does not propose any windows to the side elevations, there would be no loss of privacy for No. 76 Cleveland Road.\r\rIn conclusion, due to the scale, siting and design of the proposed development, it would result in an overly dominant addition to the host property, and given the depth and proximity to the shared boundaries, would result in an unneighbourly extension that would unduly compromise the sunlight/light and sense of overbearing for No. 76 Cleaveland Road. As such the proposed development would not conform to Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",

    "For the sake of clarity, and being asked to delete certain plans, may we ask that you submit a full set of plans only which need to be considered as part of your application.
