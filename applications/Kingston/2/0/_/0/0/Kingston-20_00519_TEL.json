    "The proposed telecommunication equipment by virtue of siting and appearance, in particular the height of the pole and the quantum of ancillary equipment, would result in an incongruous addition to the street scene that would be visually intrusive, create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS 8 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
