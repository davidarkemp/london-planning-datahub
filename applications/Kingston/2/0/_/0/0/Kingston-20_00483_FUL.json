    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Kings Drive. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r03/16295/FUL - Erection of two storey side extension incorporating garage and two storey rear extension. Application Granted on 21 Jul 2003. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of an infill side roof extension above an existing two storey side extension, as well as the installation of 1 no. rooflight on the side roofslope. Whilst this extension would not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers note that the extension would not be uncharacteristic of Kings Drive. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwellinghouse located on Woodlands Avenue. The site is located within The Berg Estate - Local Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning History\r\r4708/MC - Erection of bedroom over garage. Application Granted on 21 May 1964.\r\rConsultations\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure a maximum of approximately 5.9 metres from the rear wall of the existing side extension/garage, and approximately 3 metres from the rear wall of the original dwellinghouse. The extension would have a flat roof and would measure approximately 3 metres in height. The extension would include one lantern rooflight in its centre. Officers consider that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, and it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 34 and No. 38 Woodlands Avenue. In relation to No. 36 Woodland Avenue, this neighbouring property benefits from a single storey rear extension, in a conservatory style with windows on all elevations. The application proposes an extension of approximately 5.9 metres on the boundary with this neighbouring property. Whilst the proposed extension may result in some loss of sunlight to the closest habitable room window at this neighbouring extension, as other windows facilitate this habitable room, Officers consider the impact on levels of sunlight to No. 34 Woodlands Avenue to be acceptable. As no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, the application would not result in a loss of privacy to No. 34 Woodlands Avenue. Similarly due to the scale of the proposed development, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an overbearing impact.  \r\rIn relation to No. 38 Woodlands Avenue, as the extension is set away from the boundary with this neighbouring property, in conjunction with the scale of the proposed development and that no windows are proposed facing this property, Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 38 Woodlands Avenue by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of varying scale, design, plot styles and time periods. As it is considered that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, with the development situated to the rear of the site, Officers consider the proposed development would not cause harm to the cultural significance of The Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the conversion of an existing garage into a habitable room. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site. \r\rFurthermore, it is considered that the remaining hardstanding is of an adequate size to accommodate two off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue would not warrant a reason for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential building in C2 use.\r\rProposal \r\rDemolition of rear extension and erection of part rear ground floor extension, first floor rear extension and roof extension in association with conversion from Residential Care facility (Use Class C2) into 5no. self-contained residential flats (Use Class C3) with associated bin store, cycle provision and landscaping\r\rConsultation \r\r26 objections received. The objections can be summarised as follows\r\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Effects on trees\r- Fumes\r- Noise\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: Object on grounds of parking pressure and lack of parking beat survey.\r\r\rAssessment\r\rThe proposed development would result in the loss of C2 housing and the applicant has provided no reasoned justification for its loss or supporting evidence that there is no longer a need for its provision. As such the proposal would be contrary to Policy H12 of the London Plan and Policy DM14 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe proposal would provide a net increase of 5 residential units (at a time when the borough does not have a 5 year housing supply)including 3 x 3 bed units capable of being used as family accommodation and more than 30% of the units. In real terms the net increase would be 2 residential units with a 6 bed care home which the current C2 use provides equating to 3 open market C3 units. The units would meet the internal and external floorspace and amenity space standards. The units would be of a practical layout and include provision for refuse and recycling and cycle parking provision. \r\rIt is considered that the the proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design would create a dominant and overbearing incongruous feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and the private views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties creating an unnecessary sense of enclosure to the neighbouring properties and detract from the character and appearance of the host proeprty and the surrounding area. The proposal would not be in accordance with policy CS8 and DM10 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe proposed development would increase demand for on street parking and exacerbating existing on street car parking presures and the applicant has failed to provide any off street parking to mitigate this or evidence that there is capcity on street by way of a parking beat survey and as such the proposal is likely to prejudice highway safety. The proposal therefore would not accord Para 111 of the NPPF and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThere are no trees proposed to be removed as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe applicantion is not supported by a daylight/sunlight assessment and there is concern that the properties agjacent the application site could suffer an adverse loss of daylight/sunlight to the detriment of the existing living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rThe siting, distance, from and orientation of the buildig and habitable room widows in relation to neighbouring properties is such that it is considered that the proposed development would not have an adverse impact on the privacy or outlook of neighbouring occupiers. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, it is considered that the public benefits of providing 5 net C3 open market units including 2 family sized units is not outweighed by the disbenefits of losing specialist C2 housing and the proposals impacts on the character and appearance of the area and amenity of neighbouring occupiers and exacerbation of existing parking pressures on street. As such the proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r",
    "Consultations\r11no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. One representation received in support of the proposals.\r\rPlanning History\rNo planning history recorded.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of the existing conservatory and erection of single-storey rear extension. Conversion of existing garage to habitable space with associated changes to fenestration.  Installation of 1no front and 1no rear rooflights. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey detached dwellinghouse. \rThe surrounding properties comprise of predominantly semi-detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; \r-\tThe Impact upon Highways; and \r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained to the rear. \r\rThe proposals involve the demolition of the existing conservatory structure to the rear elevation and erection of a replacement single-storey rear extension to span the full width of the dwelling. The roof is shown to be of a pitch design. The extension would measure 7.5m in width, part 4m, part 3m in depth and have a maximum height of 3.5m.\r\rThe extension would comply with Council's guidance on scale and design of single-storey rear extensions as outlined in Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The matching buff and red colour stock brick finish to the rear extension is considered acceptable, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. \r\rTo the front elevation, the proposals seek to convert the integral garage into a habitable room with associated change from existing garage door to a window of a similar appearance to the existing main windows within the front elevation of the property. This is considered to be an acceptable alteration which would not result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the host dwelling.\r\rThe application additionally seeks the installation of one rooflight to the front roofslope and one rooflight to the rear roofslope. It is considered these would be acceptable additions to the roofslope in terms of their size, siting and design.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed rear single-storey extension would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties. Officers note that there are no side-facing openings/glazing to the proposed rear extension towards the eastern boundary to give rise to overlooking or loss of privacy of the neighbouring property to the east (i.e. No. 20). Officers note that one small side window is proposed to the western side however this is not considered to result in any detrimental amenity issues given the separation distance and relationship to the application site of those nearest properties which front onto Connaught Road. The scale and design of the extension is such that it would comply with Council's guidance on such types of development. \r\rThe alterations to the fenestration would not cause any materially harmful impacts to neighbouring amenity.\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rImpact upon Highways\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure that they are not adversely affected. \r\rThe application involves the conversion of the integral garage space, although based on the existing floor plan, it does not appear to be of a size capable of fitting a modern car. Nevertheless, the area of hardstanding/driveway to the front of the property is of an adequate size to be used as a car parking space, and so the conversion would not result in the loss of a space that would impact upon highway safety.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. In addition adequate car parking space for the property would be retained, to the satisfaction of the Council.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED\r",
