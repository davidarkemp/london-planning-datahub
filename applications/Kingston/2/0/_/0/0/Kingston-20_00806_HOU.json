    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in harm to the health and longevity of surrounding trees. As a result, the proposal would harm the setting of the Southborough Conservation Area and would be contrary to policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The application site comprises a semi-detached terraced dwelling located on the south western side of Cardinal Avenue.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular site constraints or policy designations.\r\rThe proposed development seeks permission for demolition of existing conservatory and garden room, erection of single storey rear and front porch extension and outbuilding garden room.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would comprise a timber structure with a flat roof and would span the width of the site. Outbuildings of a similar scale and construction are evident across the rear gardens of properties within Cardinal Avenue and it is considered that the proposed outbuilding would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. Officers raise no objection to the proposed demolition of the existing outbuilding. \r\rThe proposed single storey would replace the existing single storey rear extension and extend an additional 1m to the rear of the property. Whilst the extension would not accord with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of depth, it is acknowledged the proposed extension would be a visual improvement on the existing structures, utilising materials to match the host building. Officers also acknowledge other examples of deeper rear extensions in the immediate vicinity of the application property and therefore consider the proposed extension would not detract from the character or appearance of the area.\r\rWhile the proposed front porch extension would not strictly accord with the guidelines set by the Residential Design SPD, it would appear a proportionate addition to the host property, with a roof form that is consistent with the original roofslope and would be modest in height. Officers also acknowledge similar development within the streetscene. Overall Officers consider that the front porch would appear a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host property, and one which would not detract from the character or appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would project an additional 1m to the rear of the property and would comprise a solid and impermeable structure (with regard to daylight/sunlight). In terms of the relationship with No.115 Cardinal Avenue although there would be some improvement in terms of privacy (through the removal of windows to the side elevation of the existing structure), it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that it would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight/sunlight to the nearest ground floor habitable room. The proposed development would therefore be contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIt is considered that there would not be any inacceptable adverse impact upon No. 111 Cardinal Avenue in terms of amenity.\r\rOverall and in conclusion, the proposed development would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide existing and proposed floor plans at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rWe received two different existing floor plans, please submit the floor plans which is relevant to this application."
