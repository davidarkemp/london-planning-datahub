    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for Conditions 3 (Materials), 4 (Construction Method Statement) 5 (Cycle Parking), 6 (Refuse and Recycling) and 10 (Sustainability) of planning permission 19/01051/FUL have been assessed by relevant consultants and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to: inappropriate design/layout and loss of light/sunlight, party wall/boundary issues. Concerns relating to boundaries and property rights are a civil matter and are not material planning considerations which can be assessed as part of this application. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey front porch extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed single storey rear extension would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, it would have a modest height, and given that neighbouring properties benefit from existing extensions, officers note that the proposed extension would not detract from the character and appearance from the surrounding area and would not appear an inappropriate addition to the host property.\r\rThe proposed single storey side extension would be a modest scale and an appropriate roof form and height, and as such officers consider it would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rWhile the proposed hip-to-gable roof extension would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that it could be constructed under permitted development rights, officers consider this to be a credible fallback position. \r\rFinally, the proposed first floor side and rear extensions area are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that both neighbouring properties benefit from existing extensions are ground floor level, alongside existing outbuildings along the shared boundaries with the applicant's property. Given that this is the case, and that the proposed extensions at first floor level would be set in appropriately from the shared boundaries, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rThe comments of the neighbouring property with regards to loss of light to a downstairs window are noted, however, the neighbouring property has, as already stated, been extended towards the boundary thereby reducing the distance between the window and any boundary feature, moreover, a different boundary treatment, for example a solid fence or wall, would have a materially similar impact as the proposed development. Taking all matters into consideration, Officers consider that the proposed development would be acceptable. \r\rWhile two openings are proposed at first and second floor level on the side elevation of the proposed development, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure these windows are obscure-glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would demolish the existing garage, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. Further, while the proposed development would construct an integral garage, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would also not comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision.\r\rHowever, whilst the proposed garage would not be appropriate for parking cars, it would be appropriate in accommodating on-site cycle parking in accordance with the standards set out in Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises of the Fox and Hounds Public House in Surbiton.\rThe site is within the Surbiton Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rErection of a fixed canopy over outdoor seating area.\r\rConsultation\rA site notice was displayed and neighbour letters were sent out. There was one letter of objection to this application. Comment Reasons:\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rOfficer comment: The area of the Pub site to be covered, is an existing external sitting area. The site is currently in use as a public house and it is anticipated that noise from customers using this area will be monitored and controlled by Licensing Legislation. however, it is considered prudent to provide a limited planning permission to allow a full assessment of the potential impact, however, in doing so we are mindful that there is other controlling legislation and that the site is already in use as a public house and the area can lawfully be used for seating. \r\rThe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee, made no objection to the proposal.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has stated in the drawings with this application and by email dated 19/10/2021, the supporting structure for the proposal will be timber and the roof will be polycarbonate sheets. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. The applicant has also indicated with the drawings that the proposed structure will be a maximum of 3.0 metres high and a depth of 6.15 metres. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that, subject to conditions, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposal is for a canopy over an outdoor seating area in the grounds of an existing public house. \r\rA temporary permission has been recommended for the reasons highlighted on the decision notice.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
