    "Site: St Andrews and St Marks Primary School, Maple Road, Surbiton\r\rConsultations\r95no. neighbours have been notified of the proposals. No representations received. \r\rCadogan Road Conservation Area Advisory Committee - Objection. \"The school is adjacent to the Cadogan Road CA and the proposed fence height of 2.6m along this boundary is significantly higher than the normal 2m maximum.\"\r\rRBK Tree Officer - objection. Lack of detail submitted for an application which appears to involve the removal of TPO trees without clear justification.\r\rFollowing further conversations between the tree officer and applicant have alleviated any confusion regarding the loss of TPO trees and the tree officer is satisfied sufficient information has now been provided.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the eastern side of Maple Road. Maple Infant's School lies directly to the south of the St Andrews and St Marks (SASM) main building.  The school grounds are largely hard landscaped with a limited amount of green space and some mature trees. SASM is a Church of England School and is the land owner. The neighbouring school at Maple Infant is a community school owned by the Council. The buildings on site are not listed or within a conservation area. The eastern boundary of the site adjoins the Claremont Road Conservation Area and the Cadogan Road Conservation Area is sited on the opposite side of Maple Road. The site is covered by tree preservation order.\r\rPlanning History\r23/01918/FUL - Replacement of existing fence boundaries, erection of single storey 2nos group room buildings and installation of new canopy structure. Withdrawn, dated 09.10.2023.\r\r18/16148/FUL - Front entrance extension to replace existing lean to conservatory. Granted planning permission, dated 31.05.2018.\r\r16/16511/FUL - Variation of Condition 19 of permission 14/16338/FUL to alter the materials and positioning of the boundary treatment separating St Andrews/St Marks Junior School from Maple Infants School. Granted planning permission, dated 12.12.2016.\r\r14/16338/FUL - Erection of 2 storey detached classroom block; erection of single storey extension to main building and covered walkway to proposed classroom block.  Erection of multi-use games area with astroturf play area.  Siting of new cycle parking area.  Removal of existing temporary classroom module. Granted planning permission, dated 21.07.2014.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal comprises the erection of single-storey 2nos group room buildings, installation of new canopy structure and installation of replacement aluminium doors.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to:\r-\tPrinciple of Development;\r-\tImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area (including impact upon heritage assets); and\r-\tImpact upon the Amenities of Neighbouring Occupiers.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rAt paragraphs 95 of the NPPF, 2023 it states that \"it is important that a sufficient choice of school places is available to meet the needs of existing and new communities. Local planning authorities should take a proactive, positive and collaborative approach to meeting this requirement, and to development that will widen choice in education. They should:\ra) give great weight to the need to create, expand or alter schools through the preparation of plans and decisions on applications; and \rb) work with school promoters, delivery partners and statutory bodies to identify and resolve key planning issues before applications are submitted.\"\r\rLondon Plan 2021 Policy S3 (Education and Childcare Facilities) sets out that \"development proposals for education and childcare facilities should: \r1) locate facilities in areas of identified need\r2) locate facilities in accessible locations, with good public transport accessibility and access by walking and cycling \r3) locate entrances and playgrounds away from busy roads, with traffic calming at entrances \r4) link to existing footpath and cycle networks to create healthy routes to schools, and other education and childcare facilities, to enable all children to travel actively to school (walk, cycle or travel by public transport) \r5) maximise the extended or multiple use of educational facilities for community or recreational use, through appropriate design measures \r6) encourage the shared use of services between schools, colleges, universities, sports providers, and community facilities, and between early years and health and social care providers \r7) ensure that new developments are accessible and inclusive for a range of users, including disabled people, by adopting an inclusive design approach \r8) ensure that facilities incorporate suitable, accessible outdoor space 9) locate facilities next to parks or green spaces, where possible.\"\r\rPolicy DM23 (Schools) of the Council's adopted Core Strategy, the Council will: \r(a) identify potential sites for new schools to meet identified needs \r(b) designate and protect open space on school sites as shown on the Proposals Map and seek to ensure that school expansion proposals retain open space and that all options to re-organise/expand schools within the existing built footprint are explored, with a presumption against a net reduction in open space \r(c) assess proposals for new schools and school expansion against the following criteria: \r\ri. the size of the site, its location and suitability to accommodate a new school or school expansion taking account of compatibility with surrounding uses, and existing planning policy designations (e.g. Conservation Areas, MOL, Green Belt) \r\rii. the impact on green open space, games pitches, outdoor play and amenity space, taking account of the character of the area, whether the site is within an area of open space deficiency and whether the school has sufficient outdoor space for play and games \r\riii. the location and accessibility of the site in relation to: the intended catchment area of the school public transport the local highway network and its ability to accommodate new or additional school trips without adverse impact on highway safety safe and convenient walking and cycling routes to schools. \r\rThe principle of providing two single-storey classrooms, new canopy structure and installation of replacement aluminium doors is therefore supported in principle. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 201 of the NPPF, 2023 says that where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of) the significance of a designated heritage asset, permission should be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, or all of the following apply:\r- The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;\r- No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;\r- Conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and\r- The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.\r\rParagraph 202 of the NPPF goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area.\rFeatures of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rThe site borders both Claremont Road Conservation Area and Cadogan Road Conservation Area.\r\rTwo group room buildings are proposed to be installed on the school premises. The proposed two buildings would provide additional space for educational activities, meetings, and small group instruction. The design of the buildings are considered to be in keeping with the school environment with the smaller building to be finished in timber cladding and the larger building to be finished in render with uPVC windows/doors.\r\rThe existing exposed external staircase leading to the first floor classrooms is proposed to be covered with a canopy. The proposed canopy is to be of opal and clear polycarbonate sheeting and is intended to provide protection from adverse weather conditions, enhancing safety for students and staff. Officers do not object to the proposed design and materiality of the canopy.\r\rThe proposed replacement of timber doors to aluminium doors to the first floor elevation is considered to be acceptable. \rThe proposed design, materiality and finish of the proposals are considered to be acceptable to the character and appearance of the application site and wider area. The impact upon the nearby Cadogan Road Conservation Area is considered to be neutral. \rOfficers consider the proposals to comply with the policy objectives of policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rResidential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rIt is not considered the proposal would not result in any adverse impact to the amenities of neighbouring properties.\r\rImpact upon Trees\rParagraph 174 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by, among other things, recognising the benefits of trees and woodlands.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees there should be adequate replacement based on the existing value of the benefits of the trees removed, determined by, for example, i-tree or CAVAT or another appropriate valuation system. The planting of additional trees should generally be included in new developments - particularly large-canopied species which provide a wider range of benefits because of the larger surface area of their canopy.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected. Where trees are to be lost through development, the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\r\rAs stated above, RBKs trees and landscape officer has reviewed the proposals and find these to be acceptable in terms of impact upon trees and removed his original objection.\r\rHighways & Traffic Impact\rThe applicant is required to demonstrate compliance with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 in order that the proposed development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\rThe proposal is for a minor extension to the building (i.e. 2no. modular buildings for group study) and will not result in an increase in the school's pupil roll. On this basis, the proposal is not considered to cause any highway safety issues or an undue impact on the local highway network.\r\rAs such, the proposal is in accordance with paragraph 111 of the NPPF (2023), Policies T6, T6.2 and T7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rThe application including replacement aluminium doors, installation of a canopy structure over the exterior staircase and erection of 2no. group buildings to the playground area are considered to be acceptable works in terms of impact on character and appearance of the site and surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals would, have no adverse impact upon the amenities of nearby residential properties, trees or local highways.\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
