    "By reason of its excessive depth the proposed single storey infill side/rear extension would fail to accord with the prevailing suburban pattern of development and would therefore be contrary to Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed development is considered to contravene Paragraph 127 of the NPPF, 2019, Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013 as it would fail to ensure a good standard of private outdoor amenity space for the existing occupants of No. 85 Portland Road by reason of the reduction in the size of the garden.\r",
    "The design at the back of the neighbouring property (number 13) is an inverted \"L\"shape with a\rbifold door opening on to a terrace adjacent to the fence between 13 and 15 Sussex Road",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey extension approx 5m in depth under a flat roof of approx 3.8m. The extension would open onto a raised patio of approx 50cm high. The extension would be finished in materials that would match the host property. \r\rConsultation\rNeighbouring properties were notified of the application, 3 objections from a single address point have been received raising the following issues:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings;\r- Inappropriate design/layout;\r- Loss of light/sunlight; and,\r- Maintenance of neighbouring wall.\r\rThe above issues will be addressed in the report. \r\rIn relation to the maintenance, it is not uncommon for walls of neighbouring properties to be built away from the boundary line. Whilst this would make maintenance difficult, it would not be impossible. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development, whilst not strictly adhering to the SPD in terms of depth and height, would nonetheless be reflective of the context of the site and the extensions that have been permitted at neighbouring properties. As such, the proposal is considered considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would breach the 45 degree rule in both plan and elevation form regarding the nearest ground floor doors of the neighbouring property, No. 13 Sussex Road, and as such there is likely to be an impact on light to. However, the approved plans for the neighbouring extension show that the room affected is served by a number of windows and skylights and as such any reduction in light to the doors would be offset by light entering through the other windows and skylight. \r\rThe comments of the neighbour with regards to creating a sense of enclosure / impact on outlook are noted. However, given the size of their garden, any sense of enclosure would only be for a short run of the garden, and with regards to outlook, it is noted that outlook from the window facing opposite to the extension would be impacted, but other windows serving the room would not be. In any event, I do not consider that the impact on outlook would be so harmful so as to support a refusal on these grounds. \r\rThe raised patio would not result in any impact on the amenities of neighbours.\r\rOverall, on balance, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
