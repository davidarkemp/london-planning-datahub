    "By virtue of its size, scale, design and prominent corner location, the proposed first floor side extension would not appear as a subservient addition when viewed from the surrounding street scene and would unbalance the semi-detached properties. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",

If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
