    "The proposed development would not ensure an acceptable standard of amenity for future occupants, by reason of poor outlook, insufficient internal light levels on lower ground floor levels, and an insufficient provision of private outdoor amenity space, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) Policy 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM10 of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "By virtue of their size, scale, and plot size, the proposed dwellings would appear cramped and inharmonious in relation to the nature of the form of the wider development on site and the prevailing pattern of development within the area. As a result, the proposed development would harm the character and appearance of the surrounding area. This would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policies 7.4 and 7.8 of the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8, DM10 and DM11 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013). \r",
    "Due to the limited separation distance, the kitchen/dining room window serving Plot 4 would result in a loss of privacy for the ground floor flat at No.82 to 88 Charter Court. The proposal would therefore conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 16 of the Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed loss of 13 garages would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon existing car parking provision for the residents of Charter Court resulting in adverse impacts upon traffic congestion, on-street car parking pressure on surrounding roads and vehicular and pedestrian safety in the area. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the Council's refuse vehicles and emergency service vehicles can access and service the proposed dwellings. The proposal would therefore conflict the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy  D11 of the Draft New London Plan (2018).",

    "Details of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---End of Officer Report---",
    "The site comprises a semi detached dwelling. It is not located in a Conservation Area or subject to any Article 4 Direction.\r\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration.\r\rThe application follows an earlier planning permission (21/02848/HOU) for the same development but with a slightly different roof profile for some of the rear extension. In particular, a small portion of the approved pitched roof would change from a pitched roof to a flat roof.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal. No representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey ground floor extension would replace an existing structure and extend slightly beyond its footprint to the rear of the existing dwelling, with some changes to fenestration to the front and rear. The extension would be of an appropriate height and depth, with an appropriate roof form and external materials to match the host dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider the development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: There is an existing structure located on the boundary shared with No.13 Elgar Avenue and the proposed development would not increase its scale or depth as it relates to, or is visible from this property.\r \rTo No.9 Elgar Avenue, the proposed extension would be setback from the boundary and compliance with the daylight/sunlight guidance in the Residential Design SPD has been demonstrated.  Officers therefore consider the impacts on amenities would not be unduly compromised.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013). \r\r\r\r",

    "The submitted proposed block plan is labelled as existing and does not show the proposed roof plan.\r\rNote: Please provide a copy of proposed block plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
