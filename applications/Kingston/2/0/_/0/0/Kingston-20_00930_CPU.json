    "The erection of single storey rear extension and hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with removal of 1no chimney stack and installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is located within Richmond Road Conservation Area-a designated heritage asset.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rKingston Town CAAC - No objection.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- The impact of the development on heritage assessments.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension and garage would not strictly comply with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, 2013, given its width, however, it would have an appropriate height and roof form and as such would appear as a subordinate addition in relation to the host property. Given that a similar extension is viewed on neighbouring property No. 1C St Albans Road, officers consider it would appear in keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed extensions and separation distance between the proposed single storey side extension and neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposal would include the construction of a garage that would be able to safely accommodate 1 car space and 2 cycle spaces. The proposed level of car parking and cycle parking provision would be in accordance with the standards set out in the London Plan. Therefore, officers consider that the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety and would support sustainable modes of transport, in compliance with Policies T5 and T6 of the London Plan, Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012 and the standards set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above, officers consider that the proposed development would be subordinate in relation to the host property and would be in keeping with the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. It follows that Officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
