    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990.  (As amended)\r",
    "Prior to above ground works the following details shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, implemented prior to occupation and thereafter permanently retained:\r\r(a)  materials for all external finishes and window frames (including their manufacturer's specification, dimensions, colour and texture).\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to commencement of any development on site, a Construction Management Plan detailing the following:\r\r(a)  Provision for loading/unloading materials.\r(b)  Storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles.\r(c)  Signing system for works traffic.\r(d)  Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works.\r(e)  Means of enclosure of the site.\r(f)  Wheel washing equipment.\r(g)  The parking of vehicles of the site operatives and visitors\r(h)  The erection and maintenance of security hoarding.\r(i) Hours of construction and deliveries\r\rshall be submitted to the planning authority for written agreement.

    "Refuse and recycling storage facilities shall be provided prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted in accordance with details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of the development, such facilities to be permanently retained at the site. \r\rReason: In order to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be commenced until details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of and visitors to the development hereby approved have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. These facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall thereafter be retained for use at all times. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. These details are required prior to commencement of development to ensure the development would have a satisfactory appearance. \r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows or rooflights in the side elevations (and situated above ground floor) shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Within 3 months of first occupation, evidence must be submitted to the Council confirming that the development hereby permitted has achieved no less than the C02 reductions (ENE1), internal water usage (WAT1) standards equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4.  Evidence requirements are detailed in the \"Schedule of Evidence Required for Post Construction Stage from ENE1 and WAT1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes Guide.  Evidence to demonstrate a 19% reduction compared to 2013 Part L regulations and internal water usage rates of 105L/day must be submitted to the Local Planning Authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\r\rReason:  In order to ensure that all development is designed and built to make the most efficient use of resources, reduce its lifecycle impact on the environment and contributes to climate change mitigation and adaptation in accordance with Policy CS1 (Climate Change Mitigation) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    " The car parking area shown upon the approved drawings shall be provided with a porous, hard-bound dust-free surface, adequately drained before the development to which it relates is occupied and thereafter it shall be kept free from obstruction at all times for use by the occupier of the development and shall not thereafter be used for any purposes other than the parking of vehicles for the occupiers of the development and visitors to it. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking accommodation and to avoid the congestion of surrounding roads by parked vehicles in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "By the time the development hereby permitted is substantially complete, pedestrian/vehicular intervisibility splays of 2.8m x 3.3m shall have been provided in each direction where the access meets the back edge of footway and shall be permanently retained free from any obstruction to visibility higher than 1.0m above ground level. \r\rReason: To maintain pedestrian/vehicular intervisibility in the interest of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "No development shall commence until a landscaping scheme including, where applicable, the retention of the existing trees shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only. \r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. These details are required prior to commencement of development to ensure the development would have a satisfactory appearance. \r",
    "Fences, walls or other means of enclosure shall be erected along the boundaries of the site (and individual plots) prior to the occupation of the dwelling to which they relate, in accordance with details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall thereafter be permanently retained. \r\rReason: In order to ensure the privacy of adjoining occupiers and visual amenity of the area is retained in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no extensions (including porches or dormer windows) to the dwellinghouses or buildings shall be erected within the curtilage. \r\rReason: To safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard the cohesive appearance of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments:\r1. Floor finish of alleyway main access route changed from resin-bound floor finish to tarmac floor finish.\r2. Pond in Communal garden changed to central plants zone.\r3. Replace small area of brown resin-bound floor finish with grass. \rIn this case, conditions were attached to the original permission requiring the submission and approval of details of the paving surface in the pedestrian access (condition 3B) and hard and soft landscaping details (condition 6).  The conditions were subsequently discharged and approved under condition discharge reference 20/00717/CLC  and 20/01555/CLC. Officers consider that the proposed changes would need to be considered as part of a variation to the approved details secured by planning condition and an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and visual appearance of the area. As such, the proposed changes are not considered to be non-material to planning permission 18/16588/FUL.",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependant on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. \r\rThe local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.",
    "You are advised that in order to consider the variations proposed, you should submit a condition discharge application to re-dischage the relevant details approved pursuant to conditions 3B and 6 of planning permission18/16588/FUL.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal is for the erection of a single storey rear and first floor extension with associated changes to fenestration.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties were consulted. No comments were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extensions would not be highly visible from the street and so the main consideration is the impact on the character and appearance of the application property. The dual pitched roof design proposed is in keeping with the roof design of the existing property and the stepping down of the ridge heights between the main dwellinghouse, the first floor extension and the single storey rear extension would make the extensions appear suitably subordinate to the application property. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The existing rear two storey element would not be increased in height or depth on the boundary with neighbouring property, number 10 Deacon Road. The proposed single storey rear element would create an additional depth of 1.3m on the boundary with number 10 with an eaves height of approximately 2.0m. This is considered not to cause any harm to this neighbouring property in terms of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe changes on the elevation adjoining number 14 Deacon Road would be more significant. The first floor rear extension would in effect create a two storey element on the boundary with an eaves height of approximately 4.5m at a depth of 3.1m. This design would pass the 45 degree test when measured from the elevations, and falls just shy of the 45 degree test when measured from the floor plans. The properties both benefit from large south facing rear gardens and it is therefore considered that this first floor element would not not cause any unacceptable loss of light or appear overbearing from this property. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear element would have an eaves height of approximately 2.0m and depth of approximately 4.2m on the boundary. Although this depth does exceed the guidance in the Residential Design SPD, the eaves height being 2.0m and the dual pitched roof design mean that this is considered not to adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of number 14. \r\rThere are five side elevation windows proposed which would look into the side passage of number 14, and a glazed door proposed on the side elevation facing number 10. The windows are shown to be at a high level and could be conditioned to be obscure glazed and non opening below 1.7m in the event of an approval.\r\rIt is therefore considered that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Details of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---End of Officer Report---",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe proposed development is for the erection of rear/side roof extensions including raising the ridge height and installation of a rear juliet balcony.\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbours were consulted. No comments were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe design of the proposal is considered to be a piggyback extension with two side dormers. The extension is set back more than 4.0m from the front elevation. The house is on a narrow plot and the gaps between the first floor side elevations of neighbouring dwellings are no more than 2.1m, and the eaves would be retained at the side elevations with the ridge height being increased approximately 0.5m, all of which is in alignment with the majority of requirements for a piggyback extension as is outlined in the Residential Design Guide (RDG). \r\rHowever, the RDG does state that no dormer style roof extensions should be proposed in addition to a piggyback extension. The two side dormers in addition to the raised roof height would appear as one large incongruous form, which would be highly visible from the street and would be entirely out of character with the application property and other properties in the immediate character area. It is considered that this visual impact on the character of the application property and the street scene would be unprecedented and would harm the integrity and character of the property and streetscene in an unacceptable manner. \r\rWhen balancing this harm against the benefits of increasing habitable space for the current and future occupiers of the property, it is not considered to outweigh this harm, and it is also the opinion of officers that less harmful means of extending the property to achieve increased habitable space could be pursued. \r\rThe proposed development is, therefore, considered unacceptable in terms of form, bulk, height, massing and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed side dormers would fall within the footprint of the existing building. The rear juliette balcony would not provide a view substantially different from the windows at the first floor level. The proposed side elevation windows on the dormers could be conditioned to be obscure glazed and non-opening below 1.7m, were the application otherwise acceptable. It is therefore considered that the proposal would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, given the unacceptable harm the proposal would cause  to the character and appearance of the application property and streetscene, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
