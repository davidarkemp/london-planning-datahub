    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Bolton Close. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and, \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Note: The application proposes the construction of a porch area at the front of the dwellinghouse, the conversion of the garage into a habitable room and related fenestration, as well as the construction of a single storey side extension. Within the vicinity of the application site, many of the properties on Bolton Close have converted their garages into habitable rooms, and similarly designed porch areas have been constructed.  \r\rThe proposed front porch area reflects the character of the main house, and appears as part of the original building and not as an obvious addition. Whilst the inclusion of pillar to support the porch area is uncharacteristic in the streetscape, this would necessarily negatively impact the character and appearance of the area. The porch has been designed to be clearly subordinate to the existing house. The front porch is therefore acceptable in relation to character and appearance. Furthermore the conversion of the garage into a habitable room is also acceptable in relation to character and appearance. The application proposes a roof to be flush with the garage and porch area, which matches the existing roof pitch and design. In addition, the proposed fenestration is of a similar appearance to the existing. As such the proposal would be in keeping with the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe proposed single storey side extension would primarily have a flat roof. Whilst this does not reflect and relate well to the main house, there is a pitched area at the front and the flat roof element is unviewable from the streetscene. In addition, the extension is proportionate and subordinate to the house in terms of scale and mass. Side extensions should be set in from the boundary by at least 250 mm so that guttering does not overhand adjoining land. Whilst the proposed side extension is not set in by this amount for its entire depth, there is adequate space for guttering and no elements should overhang. Furthermore, as this consists primarily of a garage conversion, the pair of semi detached properties remain largely symmetrical. \r\rTherefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Note: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal involves the removal of an existing garage. Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off-street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the maximum standards set out in the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r",
    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012;\r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012; and,\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a commercial property located on the western side of Coombe Road which falls within the New Malden District Centre and has most recently operated as a cafe.\r\rThe site also falls within a designated shopping frontage and a Council designated Critical Drainage Area.\r\rThe buildings on site are not listed, or locally listed and the site does not fall within a conservation area. There are no trees on site that are covered by a Tree Preservation Order (TPO).\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 3 (moderate).\r\rProposal\rThe proposal relates to the erection of a single storey rear extension to provide additional outdoor seating for 16x customers and staff including 2no.x new toilets and a fire exit. Officers note that in the submitted planning statement the applicant alludes to changing the hours of operation, however, this has not been reflected in the application form, description of developent, or other submission documents and therefore wont be assessed as part of this application. Officers further note that this development has already been implemented on site.\r\rConsultation\r19 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - Objection on the grounds of noise and disturbance.\r\rRBK Highways and Transportation Team - No response received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposed development on highways and transportation.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development comprises a single storey rear extension that measures approximately 8.4m in depth and 2.5m in height and spans the full width of th property. It has been constructed with materials that include breeze blocks, timber supports, timber boarding and polycarbonate sheeting.  Whilst Officers acknowledge that the area on which the extension has been erected backs onto a rear service lane and is largely shielded from public view, the proposed extension appears to have been poorly constructed and utilised poor quality, flimsy materials which appear temporary in nature, do note relate well to the host premises or the immediate surrounding area. Whilst Officers consider the scale and form of the proposed development to be acceptable, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of its poor quality construction and use of poor quality materials which has resulted in an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host premises and the immediate surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  As stated above Officers consider that the proposed development is of poor quality construction and has implemented poor quality materials. As a result, the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring properties, particularly the residents living on the upper floors of Nos. 20 and 24 Coombe Road, in terms of noise and disturbance. Furthermore, the Council's Environmental Health Officer has objected to the development on the same grounds.\r\rThere would be no adverse impact on daylight/sunlight, loss of privacy or visual intrusion. \r\rHighways and Transportation\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst it is understood that the extension can accommodate up to x16 customers and would increase the existing seating capacity of the cafe, this increase is considered not to significantly intensify the existing use and is also characteristic of similar business providing more spacious seating arrangements for customers in order to comply with Covid-19 requirements. Despite the PTAL of 3 (moderate) and the lack of on site customer parking, the site is located within the New Malden District Centre and is easily accessible by rail and local bus services. As such, the development is considered not to have an adverse impact upon highway\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion and on balance the proposed development is considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the host premises and the immediate surrounding area and neighbouring residential amenity in terms of noise and disturbance, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012. The development would be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThis application proposes variations to planning permission 20/01657/HOU - granted 07/09/2020. Officers note the permission granted was not subject to a legal agreement.  \r\rThis application proposes to amend the front and side elevation at ground floor level by changing the proposed window on front elevation to a door and creating a window at ground floor level on the north western side elevation. There would be no loss of parking as a result of the development.\r\rConsultation\rEighteen neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

    "Unless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks permission for single storey side and rear extensions.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension, would be setback from the principal elevation of the host dwelling, with a modest eaves height appearing proportionate when viewed from the street. However, the extension would be located on the shared boundary with No.32 Deacon Road for an extensive depth (the full extent and beyond that of the existing host dwelling).\r\rA planning application for a side extension to the neighbouring property at No.32 Deacon Road has been referenced 21/00873/HOU however this application was refused. As such there is no side extension to this property.\r\rThe other side extension would infill the area between the application property and No.36 Deacon Road with a modest eave height and pitched roof design. This extension would also align with the proposed rear extension with a depth beyond the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD. \r\rThe proposed rear extension comprises a narrow and modest projection between and aligning with both side extensions. Officers note there does not appear to be any evidence of other infill extensions within the surrounding area. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers do not consider the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the surrounding area in terms of scale, spacing and design. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side extensions would be located directly on the shared boundaries with Nos. 32 and 36 Deacon Road, and due to the constraints of the site the proposal would result in an undue sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the occupants of these properties but particularly to No.36 Deacon Road thereby conflicting with Policy D1 of London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIn conclusion, due to the scale and siting of the proposed development, it would result in an unneighbourly extension that would unduly impact on the outlook and sense of enclosure for No. 36 Deacon Road. As such the proposed development would not conform to Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to inappropriate design and layout, and loss of light/sunlight. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor side extension would not strictly adhere to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the shared boundary, officers note that it would have a modest footprint in relation to the dwelling, would be set back from the front elevation and would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling. As such it is considered that the proposed extension would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property would be in keeping with the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevations of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
