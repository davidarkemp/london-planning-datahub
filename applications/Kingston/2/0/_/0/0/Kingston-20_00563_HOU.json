    "The proposed outbuilding, by reason of its size, design, siting and bulk would represent a prominent and incongruous feature which would be harmful to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and wider locality. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012, and policy Guidance 41 and 42 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling which is linked at either side by a garage and is also within The Groves Conservation Area. The significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area is as an early residential suburb of Kingston Town Centre dating from the mid 19th century. It went through at least three distinct waves of development before becoming a local centre with a church, public house, shops and a school. \r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing garage and erection of a new replacement garage.\r\rConsultation\rForty one surrounding neighbours have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rMalden & Coombes Conservation Area Advice Committee - No Objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on The Groves Conservation Area\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment: \rDue to the subordinate nature of the proposal, officers consider that the proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and would not cause any harm to the significance of the heritage asset. Since no harm has been identifed it is not neccesary to weigh agains public benefit.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: The current garage is too small to accomodate a modern car. The proposed garge due to the limited space available would also remain too small to park a car. For this reason no loss of parking has been identified.  The Proposed garage would provide access through to the rear of the property and would be capable of cycle storage. The proposed garage would also allow for a future charging point for an electric vehicle.  The proposal is considered to achieve general compliance with Policy T5.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide existing roof plan at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work.\r\rThe stated scale  in the submitted existing roof plan is 1:100 but the provided scale bar does not measure to the stated scale."
