    "The grade guide wall, permanent capping beam and excavation of trenches for services are material operations (for the purposes of Section 56 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990) forming part of the development authorised by planning permission 15/12961/REM, and sufficient evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that these works have been commenced in compliance with that planning permission.",
    "Consultations\r29no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. 5no. responses were received which comprised 4 objections and 1 neutral comment. In summary, the objections raised the following summarised concerns:\r-poor design;\r-inappropriate use;\r- highways concerns; and,\r-concerns regarding the operation of the business.\rHowever, of the total 5no. responses received, only four were received within the statutory consultation period. As such, and in accordance with the Council's constitution, officers are permitted to deal with this application under delegated authority. \r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer: No objections. \r\rRBK Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comment.\r\rSite & Surroundings\rThe application site lies on the northern side of Red Lion Road between a short terrace of properties and extends to an area of 311.29sqm. The ground floor is occupied by retail uses with residential units above. \r\rThe application site is given additional means of access from the rear off Thornhill Road. \r\rThe application property is not listed and the site is not located within a conservation area.\r\rPlanning History\r01/08028/FUL - Continued use for the display and sale of cars.  Continued use of detached garage for preparation of cars for sale. Granted temporary planning permission, dated May 2001.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full retrospective planning permission for the demolition of existing detached garage, the erection of a new single storey office building, with WC facility, located at the back of the site for the preparation of cars for sale and the continued use of land for the display and sale of cars.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tthe principle of development;\r-\tdesign and impact upon the streetscene; \r-      impact on neighbouring amenity; and,\r-\tthe impact upon highway safety.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rOfficers note that the application site has been in use for the display and sale of cars since 2001. As such, there is no objection to the principle of the retention of the site for these same car sales purposes. The associated demolition and redevelopment of the car sales office is similarly accepted in principle.  \r\rDesign and Impact upon the streetscene\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThere was previously a detached timber garage on site that was used as an office by the applicant (AutoHaven Ltd) but this has recently been demolished. The replacement building now sits back further towards the rear of the site, allowing for more space to the forecourt for cars to be displayed.\r\rOfficers note that the previous office building was of a temporary construction and not of any particular design merit. The replacement structure would be single-storey in height and built in brick with a sand and cement render finish. It would occupy approximately 30sqm of the total 311sqm site. \r\rWhilst Officers acknowledge that the building would appear relatively utilitarian and of limited design merit, the building's positioning further back within the site is considered to limit its visual presence on the site. In addition, the relationship of the site to other neighbouring buildings means that they serve to somewhat shield the building from longer-range views in the streetscene.\r\rImpact upon Neighbouring Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including any impact on privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed building is relatively modest in scale (approx 27sqm) and, as mentioned in the above section of this report, its proposed positioning so as to be sited further back within the site (effectively replacing the garage structure which has been demolished) would limit any sense of visual intrusion or loss of privacy due to the separation distances between neighbouring residential properties. The openings to the building would predominantly be to the front elevation facing onto Red Lion Road and the front car lot. A horizontal window and one small window to the WC would feature to the side elevation, however, these would not cause any undue impact due to the existing boundary treatment in the form of close-boarded fencing and the detached single-storey structure to the site adjacent to the west. \r\rA condition has been re-attached to preclude the operators from undertaking car repairs on the site in the interests of protecting nearby residential amenity in terms of noise and disturbance. \r\rOn balance, officers do not consider there to be any material adverse impacts to residential amenity associated with the proposals over and above the existing situation. \r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 1b (poor). \r\rThere is an existing entry/exit system from the site via dropped kerbs off Red Lion Road and visibility is good to the east and west, although the site is within close proximity to a bus stop. The traffic generated by the facility does not appear to cause any significant congestion on the adjoining highway and adequate space is available on the forecourt for the safe entry and exit of vehicles. There is no highway objection to the proposal. Notwithstanding, it is considered necessary to attach the same conditions as previously imposed on the lapsed planning permission (ref: 01/08028/FUL) to ensure there is no adverse impact in highways terms. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, Officers consider that development would not result in an unacceptable impact in terms of character and appearance and highways and transportation.  As such, it is considered that the proposed development would achieve general compliance with the NPPF, 2021, the London Plan, 2021, the Core Strategy, 2012, and the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat retrospective planning permission be GRANTED \r",
