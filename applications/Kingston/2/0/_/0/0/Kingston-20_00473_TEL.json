The proposal would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "The applicant is informed that all necessary highways licenses and temporary traffic orders must be put in place, in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
