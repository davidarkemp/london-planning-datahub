The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Paragraph 4.30 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).  \r",
