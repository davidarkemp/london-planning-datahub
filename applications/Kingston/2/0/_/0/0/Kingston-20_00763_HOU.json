    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development  hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of existing rear patio with a roof canopy to an enclosed conservatory.\r\rConsultation\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified and 3 objections from 2 addresses have been received stating;\r- Increased Noise\r- Loss of Privacy\r- Impact on Drainage\r- Loss of Garden\r\rOfficers have comprehensively reviewed the objections received and careful consideration has been given to them during the assessment of the proposed development.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposal would convert an existing patio/roof canopy into a fully enclosed conservatory. The conservatory would remain subservient in height to the main dwelling and existing rear extension. It is considered that sufficient rear/side garden would be retained. Overall, it is considered that the proposal would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The main properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 238 Malden Road and No. 18 Wilton Grove. Due to the existing built form between No. 240 and No. 238 Malden road, it is considered that no harm to amenity would be created by the development. \r\rIn relation to No.18 Wilton Grove, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely impact the amenities of the occupiers of this property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy as the conservatory as a whole would remain subservient in height to the existing rear extension. Officers note that there is a side window on the side elevation of No. 18 Wilton Grove facing towards No. 240, however, the proposal would be no greater in height than the existing canopy and it would be subservient in height to the main dwelling. There would be no significant loss of privacy due to existing boundary treatment and when the existing fenestration at No. 240 which faces towards No. 18 Wilton Grove is considered.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rThe submitted block plan does not show the position of the proposed drop kerb.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed plans to show drop kerb at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rThe submitted proposed plan does not have a scale bar."
