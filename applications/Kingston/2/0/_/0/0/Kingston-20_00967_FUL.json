    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a ground floor flat in a semi-detached building located on Villiers Road. The site is within a Controlled Parking Zone, and is partly within Flood Zone 2, as well as the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of single storey side and rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r17 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r-The impact of the development on character and appearance. \r-The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r-The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: \rThe proposed rear extension would extend beyond the rear wall by an additional 1.5m, with a pitched roof 2.4m in height to the eaves and designed with materials to match the existing, in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.  The proposed side extension would maintain the same height of the rear extension and would be setback from the front elevation sufficiently to ensure the street scene view is not unduly compromised. It is acknowledged that the side extension would not be strictly with Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would be set along the common boundary, however given the modest scale of the proposal and its design, it is considered that it would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rOfficers Comments: The Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character constitutes a non-designated heritage asset. As it is considered that the proposed development would result in an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse, Officers consider that the proposed development would also not result in harm to the cultural significance of the non-designated heritage asset, the Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:\rGiven the siting, scale and design of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposed extension would pass the 45 degree rule with regards to the window to the rear elevation at the ground floor level at the adjoining property No 66 Villiers Road and given its modest eaves height of approximately 2.4m and separation distance, it is considered not to result in an overbearing effect in relation to this neighbouring property. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rFlood Risk\rThe applicant has indicated that the floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate. The application is therefore acceptable in relation to flooding. In conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the retrospective character of the application and the enforcement enquiry for the site address. \r\rThe solar panels installed over the rear dormer roof are projecting approximately 40 cm in its highest point above the existing roof line. It is acknowledged that while the siting of the proposal and its projection above the existing roof ridge is contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, it is considered acceptable in this case due to the modest scale, appearance and nature of the proposal.\r\rIt is acknowledged that the solar panels installed to the main roof given their siting would be visible within the street view, however considering its scale and appearance it is considered that the proposal would not have significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rThe panels installed over the roof of the garden storage are projecting approximately 80 cm above the existing flat roof in its highest point, resulting in a total height of approximately 3.4m. Considering its siting and scale and the existing neighbouring structure along the boundary, it is considered acceptable in this case. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its nature, siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a flat roof height of 3.2m, which exceeds the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33. However, the extension would have a modest depth of 3.5m which is 2m further than the existing outrigger, it would not be clearly visible from the street and would not be dissimilar to extensions in the immediate vicinity. \r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45  Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD.\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the development in relation to neighbouring properties and neighbouring extensions, it is considered that the development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and conversion of garage into habitable room\r\rConsultation\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the highways; and\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to the conversion of the garage, officers note that several properties within the street already benefit from garage conversion. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed single storey rear extension would only be 3 metres in depth and would be in compliance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD. It is considered by officers that overall, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. Despite the loss of the garage and potential cycle storage therein, the application property and garden is of an adequate size to accommodate dedicated and secure cycle storage and access from the front of the property to the rear would be retained.  Therefore, the proposal is considered to achieve general compliance with Policy T5.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which is considered sufficient.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling. The site is located in the non designated heritage asset the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character.\r\rConsultation \r\rNo response received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. Para 203 of the NPPF requires the LPA to consider the impact of a development on any non designated heritage asset and this is echoed by Policy DM12 of the Core Strategy.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the host property or the non designated heritage asset the Lime Grove Local Area of Special Character which the site forms part of as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters \r\rA condition requiring the submission of a fire safety strategy/statement is recommended in order for the development to accord with policy D12 of the London Plan. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Consultations\r6no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. One representation received, with comments raised in relation to the proposed materiality of the extension and the impact upon the bay tree (which is absent from submitted plans).\r\rOfficer Comment: Reference is made to a bay tree at a neighbouring property. The referenced tree is not protected by way of a Tree Preservation Order (TPO) and it is noted that the cutting back of any vegetation or roots which overhang or encroach on the application site would be allowed under common law.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey side and rear extension and changes to fenestration.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application property is a two-storey, detached dwellinghouse located on the northern side of St Albans Road, close to the junction with Studland Road. The existing dwelling benefits from a piggyback-style roof extension. \r\rThe surrounding area is residential with detached and semi-detached dwellings. \r\rThe application property is not statutory or locally listed and is not located within a Conservation Area or Area of Special Character.\r\rPlanning History\r08/12281/FUL - Erection of roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Planning permission granted on 1July 2008.\r\r21/03969/HOU - Erection of single storey side and rear extension, addition of new rear window at second floor. Refused planning permission, dated 11 February 2022 for the following reasons:\r\r(1)\tThe applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, undue sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the nearest ground floor habitable room at adjoining property, No.39 St Albans Road. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r22/01508/HOU - Erection of single storey side and rear extension, addition of new rear window in second floor. Granted planning permission, dated 5 July 2022.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would extend the full width of the dwelling and feature a flat roof. The height of the flat parapet roof to the proposed wraparound side and rear extension is shown to be 3.2 metres in height, abutting the common shared boundary with no.39 St Albans Road. This marks an increase in height from the approved extensions by 0.2m. The proposed side extension is shown to be positioned at a 0.5m set back from the front elevation of the original dwelling, which would comply with RBK guidance as set out in the Residential Design SPD, appearing as a sufficiently subservient addition to the main dwellinghouse. The rear extension is proposed to contrast with the original house as a contemporary addition through the proposed use of Corten steel. Whilst officers note that the choice of material to the extension would differ from that of the original dwelling, it would nonetheless read clearly as a contemporary addition. \r\rOfficers note that the application property is not located within a local area of special character or conservation area, nor does it pertain to, or is it adjacent to, a listed or locally listed building which would require greater restrictions in terms of materiality.\r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe flat roof of the rear / side wraparound extension would be 3.2 metres in height, abutting the common shared boundary with No.39 St Albans Road. \r\rThere is a large window at ground floor level to the rear of no.39 St Albans Road, which is set away from the common shared boundary with the application property. The depth of the proposed rear extension would be 3.9 metres, which exceeds the guidelines in Residential Design SPD (2013).  However, as a result of the large window at ground floor level to the rear of no.39 St Albans Road, being set away from the common shared boundary and the proposed height of the proposed rear extension, the depth of extension is considered to be acceptable and would have no significant impact on no.39, in terms of overbearing impact, sense of enclosure, or loss of outlook.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would be built to the North of the rear of no.39. As a result of this, there would be no significant loss of daylight or direct sunlight caused to no.39, by the proposed development when compared to the existing situation.\r\rIn terms of overlooking, neighbouring properties are overlooked by existing windows at first floor level and the addition of a second floor window, would not cause a significant loss of privacy. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which would comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan and a condition is recommended accordingly.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be appropriate to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. \r\rIn addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been raised relating to the loss of light/sunlight. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\r Design\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a depth of 6m, exceeding the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2Policy Guidance 33. However, the proposed extension would not be clearly visible from the street and would not be dissimilar to extensions in the immediate vicinity. Therefore, on balance, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extensions, using the BRE, 45  Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD. Whilst the proposed extension would have a depth of 6m, the proposed eaves height would be 2.2m and the pitched roof form would further reduce the harm to neighbouring properties, in regard to light. \r\rTherefore, given the siting of the development in relation to neighbouring properties and neighbouring extensions, it is considered that the development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
