    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2x front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion and alterations to chimney falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The assessment of this application is been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings. If it transpires that the drawings submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThis application follows previously refused application (21/00613/HOU 26.04.2021) which was refused for the following reason;\r\rThe proposed development, by reason of its scale, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling, would unduly erode the gap to No. 61 The Ridings resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant has revised the plans in order to address the reason for refusal.\r\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified and one objections have been received stating:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\rThese points will be addressed within the report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the changes made in relation to the first floor side extension. However the proposed development would now result in incongruous and unbalanced roof form.  The proposed development is therefore considered unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\r\rOfficer Comment: In relation to the proposed single storey rear extension, The applicant has demonstrated through the submission of a prior notification householder extension application that this extension would be permitted development (21/00585/PAEXT granted 23/03/2021).  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOverall, officers conclude that the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Since there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, it is recommended that permission be refused.",

The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
