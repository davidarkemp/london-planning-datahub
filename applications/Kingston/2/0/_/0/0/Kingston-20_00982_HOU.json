    "The application site is a semi-detached two storey dwelling to the west of Brunswick Road, Kingston.\r\rThe site lies within the Park Road Conservation Area. \r\rThere are individual TPOs to the front of the site. \r\rFlood Zone 1.\r\r38 neighbouring properties have been notified with 1 objection received:\ro\tOut of character / adverse impact on Conservation Area\ro\tDaylight and Sunlight\r\r\rKingston Town Conservation Area Advisory Committee: Object to harm to street scene and Conservation Area\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\r21/03676/HOU - Erection of first floor rear extension including balcony - Refuse 07.02.2022.\r\rReason for Refusal:\r\r1.\tBy reason of its excessively bulky appearance and flat roof forms the proposed development is considered not to relate well to the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the immediate surrounding area, causing less than substantial harm to the significance of the Park Road Conservation Area. This harm would not be outweighed against any public benefit. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies HC1 and D3 of the NPPF 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r2.\tThe siting and proximity of the proposed roof terrace to the shared boundary would result in an unacceptable adverse impact on the amenity of neighbouring property, No. 24 Brunswick Road in terms of loss of privacy/overlooking. Additionally, the applicant has failed to provide sufficient details as to the proposed boundary treatment of the roof terrace and has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed increase in height of the single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 24 Brunswick Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. The proposal would therefore conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8 andDM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r11/12130/HOU - Erection of Single Storey Side/Rear Extension - Granted 26.04.2011\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rDesign and Heritage Assets \rImpact on neighbour amenity\r\rDesign and Heritage Assets\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rLocal policies CS8, DM10, DM11 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) require that proposals relate well to their surroundings, recognise distinctive local features, have regard to the historic environment and be of a high standard to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.  \r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\rPolicy Guidance 34 of the Residential Design SPD:\r\ro\tTwo storey extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwelling. \ro\tExtensions proposed on the boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted. \ro\tAdequate separation distances between neighbouring properties should be maintained (as discussed above).\ro\tAdequate daylighting and sunlighting of neighbouring properties should be maintained using the 45 and 25 degree principles discussed above. \ro\tOn narrow width properties - particularly terraced properties, two storey rear extensions are unlikely to be appropriate as they often result in an unreasonable loss of daylight, sunlight and outlook for adjoining properties. \ro\tThe roof should relate well to the host property and its existing roof and should not be higher than the ridge of the existing roof. \ro\tThe roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the 2nd floor. \ro\tFlat roofs should generally be avoided unless a flat roof is a feature of the existing building, and the use of a flat roof for a roof terrace or balcony at two-storey height will generally not be acceptable as it may give rise to overlooking of neighbouring properties.\r\rOfficers Comment: \r\rThe Park Road Conservation Area is an area of fine Victorian houses and local shops dating from 1890 -1900.  The Character Appraisal for the Conservation Area identifies Brunswick Road as being within Character Area 2. Brunswick Road was laid out in 1885 and 26 villas were built by James Robinson of Wimbledon to the designs of Alfred Olley, an architect also of Wimbledon. The street's character derives from the controlled vocabulary of domestic architectural features and well-detailed frontages, which are skilfully adapted to provide corner buildings. The design of the north and south sides of the road is different, although the impression is of a unified style because of the features they have in common - two storey canted bays, red brick, stone dressings. The north side has handed pairs of wide-fronted houses, originally with small gabled dormers, while the south side has narrowly-detached single houses with decorative gables. At the east end, two matching pairs occupy the corner plots, with angled and steeply-gabled bays at the corners and bays to the side elevations to add modelling. Nos. 21 and 23 is an unusual and interesting pair asymmetrically designed (one large, one small) to look like a single house, with a tall gabled frontage. Boundaries rarely survive, but, where they do, (for example at nos. 17 & 19) they are low brick walls with stone copings and piers, some surmounted by hedges.\r\rThe Character Appraisal also recognises the introduction of Nos. 22 and 24 Brunswick Road, a new pair of houses granted permission on 29th September 2003. The design of the street façade of the new building was closely modelled on the existing detached houses on the south side of Brunswick Road. It is of similar proportions and incorporates principal design features found in the existing houses, including square and angled bays and a steeply pitched front gable. However, the new building\rThe Character Appraisal recognises two of the key features of the Conservation Area being:\r\ro\tThe area has a generally high quality of Victorian suburban residential and commercial development. The majority of buildings make a positive contribution to the character of the area and retain most of their original form and good quality architectural features and details.\ro\tThe area has a range of house types and sizes that fall into three well-  - 27 - defined groups, with their own distinct architectural and townscape characteristics at Kingston Hill, Brunswick Road and Clifton Road/Orchard Terrace. The groups also relate to each other to give an overall visual character to the conservation area, through their limited palette of building materials: stock brick and red brick, with stone detailing and slate roofs. All three groups have distinctive features particular to the group.\r\rOfficer comment: A two storey rear extension is proposed that would match the depth of the existing single storey rear extension to the property (3.5m in depth and 3.3m in width). \r\rThe extensions is broadly comparable in scale to the previously refused application (21/03676/HOU), albeit is slightly larger in width. The extension now does not extend beyond the side elevation of the property and has a pitched/gable roof as opposed to the flat roof extensions previously proposed.\r\rThe proposed two storey extension will not be visible from the front of the property given the extension does not extend beyond the side of the building and due to the close proximity of the neighbouring 20 Brunswick Road and existing mature vegetation. The proposed extension is likely to be visible from the north side of Brunswick Road (between 16 and 18 Brunswick Road).  However, the extension is relatively modest in scale (proportionate and subservient to the existing building) and is designed in a manner that is respectful of the architectural style and materials of the existing building and surrounding area. On this basis, the proposed extension is not considered to result in harm to the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.\r\rOverall, the proposed extensions are considered acceptable by reason of their design, siting, scale, mass, height and materials and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the Park Road Conservation Area. As such, the proposal is in accordance with the NPPF, Policy D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10 and DM 12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013). \r\rNeighbour Amenity\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: The neighbouring properties most affected by the proposal are No. 24 Brunswick Road to the south and No's 16 and 20 Brunswick Road to the north. \r\rThe two storey extension is 6m in height (5m to the eaves) and extends 3.5m beyond the primary rear elevation of the building, matching the depth of the existing single storey rear extension to the property. \r\rThe extension is set in 1.7m from the neighbour boundary with No. 24 Brunswick Road and the plans indicate that the extension will not interrupt the 45 degree line to the nearest habitable window to the neighbouring property. For these reasons, and as the height is not unreasonable, the proposal is not considered overbearing or likely to result in undue loss of daylight or sunlight to this neighbour. \rNo. 20 Brunswick Road is set further back than the host property and its rear extension would be set back approximately 3.3m from the rear of the proposed extension. Notwithstanding, the proposed extension is set 1.3m away from the neighbour boundary (and approx. 4.3m from the rear extension to this property) and so it is not considered that the proposal would be overbearing for this neighbour. Whilst the extension would be sited south of the rear extension to No. 20 Brunswick Road, and so potentially impacting on daylight and sunlight levels, there are no flank windows on the side of the property that would be affected directly by the proposed extension (any flank windows would be affected by the existing dwelling itself) and the plans demonstrate that the extension would not interrupt the 45 degree line of the rear facing habitable window to the neighbour extension. The proposal would result in some overshadowing to the rear garden area of the neighbouring property, however, this is not considered to be unreasonable given the scale of the extension. \r\rIn comparison to the previous scheme, an external terrace no longer forms part of the proposal and there is not considered to be an undue loss of privacy/overlooking arising from the proposed extension itself given the established level of overlooking at the site and surrounding area.\r\rFor these reasons, the proposed development is not considered to unduly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy, subject to conditions. The proposal is in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and DM 10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a brief Fire Statement. The plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for approval, subject to the conditions listed above. \r",
