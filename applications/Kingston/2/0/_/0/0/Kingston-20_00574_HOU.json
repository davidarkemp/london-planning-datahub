    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The roofs of the extensions hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the western (flank) elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the western (flank) elevation of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2x objections have been received by the Council, highlighting the following concerns:-\r-Inappropriate design/layout; and,\r-Privacy.\r\rOfficer Comment:- No. 59 Northcote Road is not a statutorily listed building and is not in a conservation area. A rear dormer attached to the roof of a single dwellinghouse, is normally considered permitted development. The increase in overlooking and loss of privacy caused to neighbouring properties to the rear and side, would be the same as that caused by a rear dormer installed in the roof of this property, within permitted development rights for this property. A condition is recommended to restrict overlooking and loss of privacy caused by windows on the flank of the proposal. It is accepted, that the large window to the front of the proposal, would slightly increase overlooking and loss of privacy to the front of properties on the opposite side of Northcote Road. However, the increase overlooking and loss of privacy caused to the front of these properties would be negligible, when the existing overlooking and lack of privacy caused to the front of these properties, is taken into account.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The front wall/window of the proposed side and rear roof dormer extension would be set behind the front wall of the original dwellinghouse. The flat roof of the proposed dormer would also be set down slightly in relation to the ridge of the main roof, shared with no.57 Northcote Road. It is accepted that side roof dormers are not characteristic of this part of Northcote Road. However, the size and overall design of the proposal would be acceptable and appear subordinate, when viewed from street level and properties opposite. Overall and on balance, it is considered that there would be no significant adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the streetscene, or local area, as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rOfficer Comment: Given the sitting of the proposed development in relation to habitable windows of neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rOfficers note that windows are proposed to the side elevation at second floor level. Therefore, to ensure that there is no loss of privacy/mutual overlooking in relation to neighbour properties officers consider that a condition should be imposed in the event of an approval to ensure that the window is obscure-glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor level. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

    "Condition 25 (Archaeological Impact Assessment):\r\rCondition 25 states;\r\rIf heritage assets of archaeological interest are identified by stage 1 WSI then for those parts of the site which have archaeological interest a stage 2 WSI shall be submitted to and approved by the local planning authority in writing. For land that is included within the stage 2 WSI, no demolition/development shall take place other than in accordance with the agreed stage 2 WSI which shall include:\r\rA. The statement of significance and research objectives, the programme and methodology of site investigation and recording and the nomination of a competent person(s) or organisation to undertake the agreed works.\r\rB.
