However, due to the insufficient/unacceptable submission for Conditions 6 (Construction Management Plan) and 17 (Drainage Design), this application has been refused.",
    "The Local Lead Flood Authority raise an objection to the submitted details in relation to Condition 17 (Drainage Design) for the following reasons:\r\rThe Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) provided by the Environment Agency shows that the site lies in an area of low risk of surface water flooding (meaning there is between 0.1% and 1% likelihood of flooding occurring in a given year). An online version of this mapping data is available to view through the Environment Agency's Long term flood risk information mapping.\r\rThe applicant has proposed to discharge surface water as existing to the Thames Water foul sewer at a restricted rate of 3.2 l/s. SuDS in the form of an underground cellular attenuation tank, green roof and permeable paving has been proposed to contribute to the site's drainage. A flow control device has been incorporated into the drainage system to restrict flow to the proposed discharge rate. It is stated in the drainage strategy that \"Infiltration is not possible on this site due to the findings on groundwater and soils within the site\". The applicant has not followed the drainage hierarchy (NPPG, Paragraph 056 Reference ID: 7-056-20220825) by proposing to discharge to a foul sewer.\r\rThe LLFA does not consider the foul network to be a drainage system for surface water and does not consider the current proposal to discharge to a foul network to feature on the sustainable drainage hierarchy. This is not considered a sustainable form of drainage. Additionally, in accordance with the Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Act 2003); a surface water connection may not be connected to a foul water sewer without consent of the sewerage undertaker. Therefore, the applicant is required to demonstrate permission from Thames Water for a connection (historical or proposed) and Thames Water retains the right to not permit a connection of surface water to a foul network.\r\rDrainage calculations have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed drainage system (at proposed rates, 3.2 l/s) can contain up to the 1 in 30 storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event would be safely contained on site. However drainage calculations do not include all areas that contribute to the drainage system. It is stated in section 2.2 that 0.054 ha and 0.024 ha make up impermeable and permeable areas (that contribute to the drainage system) respectively. However drainage calculations do not show that this amount of area has been modelled. The applicant should adjust drainage calculations to include all areas that contribute to the drainage system, attenuation storage volume should be adjusted as required.\r\rA surface water drainage layout as required has been provided to show the location of the proposed drainage components and the connectivity of the system. The layout also shows pipe numbers, gradients and pipe sizes complete, together with storage volumes of all SuDS components. A revised drainage layout should be provided to show the proposed drainage components and the connectivity of the system to the point of discharge. The revised layout should reflect any changes (connection point and or attenuation volumes) made in response to drainage hierarchy and drainage calculation concerns.\r\rThe LLFA does not recommend the discharge of this condition because the currently proposed drainage system does not comply with the hierarchy of sustainable drainage set out in the London Plan, Policy SI 13 and sufficient justification has not been provided to support the proposed drainage scheme. The applicant should aim to discharge into the nearby surface water sewer or provide necessary documents that demonstrate permission from Thames Water for discharge to a foul sewer as it's currently being proposed. Additionally, drainage calculations should be revised to include all areas that contribute to the drainage system and revised surface water layout provided to reflect any changes made.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Park Road Conservation Area. The significance of the Park Road Conservation Area is as an early residential and commercial suburb of Kingston Town Centre dating from the mid 19th century, which incorporates the historic London to Portsmouth route. It contains fine Victorian houses and survives as a local centre with two groups of shops of distinctive character around its key junction.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of an existing rear extension and erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r25 Neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r\rKingston CAAC - No objection\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 205-214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the The Park Road Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to its siting, limited depth and height, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area or the local area of special character as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regards to the proposed infill rear extension, it is noted that the proposed rear extension would be 6.5m in depth and 2.66 metres in height hard up against the boundary with No. 27 Victoria Road. Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook for the closest habitable room window at neighbouring No. 27 Victoria Road, also resulting in an undue sense of enclosure.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
