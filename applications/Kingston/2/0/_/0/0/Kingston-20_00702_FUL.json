However, due to the insufficient/unacceptable submission for Conditions 6 (Construction Management Plan) and 17 (Drainage Design), this application has been refused.",
    "The Local Lead Flood Authority raise an objection to the submitted details in relation to Condition 17 (Drainage Design) for the following reasons:\n\nThe Flood Map for Surface Water (FMfSW) provided by the Environment Agency shows that the site lies in an area of low risk of surface water flooding (meaning there is between 0.1% and 1% likelihood of flooding occurring in a given year). An online version of this mapping data is available to view through the Environment Agency's Long term flood risk information mapping.\n\nThe applicant has proposed to discharge surface water as existing to the Thames Water foul sewer at a restricted rate of 3.2 l/s. SuDS in the form of an underground cellular attenuation tank, green roof and permeable paving has been proposed to contribute to the site's drainage. A flow control device has been incorporated into the drainage system to restrict flow to the proposed discharge rate. It is stated in the drainage strategy that \"Infiltration is not possible on this site due to the findings on groundwater and soils within the site\". The applicant has not followed the drainage hierarchy (NPPG, Paragraph 056 Reference ID: 7-056-20220825) by proposing to discharge to a foul sewer.\n\nThe LLFA does not consider the foul network to be a drainage system for surface water and does not consider the current proposal to discharge to a foul network to feature on the sustainable drainage hierarchy. This is not considered a sustainable form of drainage. Additionally, in accordance with the Water Industry Act 1991 (as amended by the Water Act 2003); a surface water connection may not be connected to a foul water sewer without consent of the sewerage undertaker. Therefore, the applicant is required to demonstrate permission from Thames Water for a connection (historical or proposed) and Thames Water retains the right to not permit a connection of surface water to a foul network.\n\nDrainage calculations have been provided to demonstrate that the proposed drainage system (at proposed rates, 3.2 l/s) can contain up to the 1 in 30 storm event without flooding and that any onsite flooding between the 1 in 30 and the 1 in 100 plus 40% climate change storm event would be safely contained on site. However drainage calculations do not include all areas that contribute to the drainage system. It is stated in section 2.2 that 0.054 ha and 0.024 ha make up impermeable and permeable areas (that contribute to the drainage system) respectively. However drainage calculations do not show that this amount of area has been modelled. The applicant should adjust drainage calculations to include all areas that contribute to the drainage system, attenuation storage volume should be adjusted as required.\n\nA surface water drainage layout as required has been provided to show the location of the proposed drainage components and the connectivity of the system. The layout also shows pipe numbers, gradients and pipe sizes complete, together with storage volumes of all SuDS components. A revised drainage layout should be provided to show the proposed drainage components and the connectivity of the system to the point of discharge. The revised layout should reflect any changes (connection point and or attenuation volumes) made in response to drainage hierarchy and drainage calculation concerns.\n\nThe LLFA does not recommend the discharge of this condition because the currently proposed drainage system does not comply with the hierarchy of sustainable drainage set out in the London Plan, Policy SI 13 and sufficient justification has not been provided to support the proposed drainage scheme. The applicant should aim to discharge into the nearby surface water sewer or provide necessary documents that demonstrate permission from Thames Water for discharge to a foul sewer as it's currently being proposed. Additionally, drainage calculations should be revised to include all areas that contribute to the drainage system and revised surface water layout provided to reflect any changes made.",

    "Application Site\nThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Park Road Conservation Area. The significance of the Park Road Conservation Area is as an early residential and commercial suburb of Kingston Town Centre dating from the mid 19th century, which incorporates the historic London to Portsmouth route. It contains fine Victorian houses and survives as a local centre with two groups of shops of distinctive character around its key junction.\n\nProposal\nDemolition of an existing rear extension and erection of a single storey rear extension.\n\nConsultation\n25 Neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\n - Loss of light/Sunlight\n - Privacy\n\nKingston CAAC - No objection\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the development on heritage assets;\n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\n- Fire safety. \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\n\nHeritage Assets\nSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \nParagraphs 205-214 of the NPPF 2023 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\n\nOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area and therefore no impact on the The Park Road Conservation Area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh any harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment: Due to its siting, limited depth and height, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\nThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling within the Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character.\n\nProposal\nDemolition of single storey rear extension and erection of single storey rear/side infill extension, floor plan redesign and all associated works\n\nConsultation\n6 neighbouring propoerties have been notified and no representation have been received.\n\nAssessment\nThe key areas of assessment are:\n- The design of the proposed development; \n- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \n- Flood Risk; and,\n- Fire safety. \n\nDesign\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\n\nPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\n\nParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\n\nThe Albert Road/Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.\n\nParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\nThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\n\nOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area or the local area of special character as a result of the proposed development.\n\nNeighbouring Amenities\nPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\n\nPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\n\nOfficer Comment:  With regards to the proposed infill rear extension, it is noted that the proposed rear extension would be 6.5m in depth and 2.66 metres in height hard up against the boundary with No. 27 Victoria Road. Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of outlook for the closest habitable room window at neighbouring No. 27 Victoria Road, also resulting in an undue sense of enclosure.\n\nFlood Risk\nPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\n\nOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \n\nThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\n\nFire Safety\nLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\n\nOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \n\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Positive and Proactive\nIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\n\nBuilding Regulations\nYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\n\nParty Wall Act\nThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\n\n- carry out work to an existing party wall;\n- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\n- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\n\nNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\n\nProperty Boundaries\nYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\n\nConsistency of Plans\nReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\n\nConstruction Site Noise\nWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \n\nYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\n\nDefinition of Approved in Writing\nWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\n\nGround Level / Base Level\nUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.
