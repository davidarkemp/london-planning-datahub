    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",

The details submitted shall be designed to manage the transport needs of the employees, in order to demonstrate a car restraint policy for the site, minimise car usage and promote alternative modes of transport. This must include details on the number of employers at site. The approved scheme shall be implemented at the time of first occupation of the development and shall be retained for the life of the development.\r\rReason: To ensure that sustainable transport methods are encouraged and implemented in accordance with Policies CS5 (Reducing the Need to Travel) and CS6 (Sustainable Travel) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the first occupation of the development hereby approved, the cycle parking facilities as shown on the approved drawings shall be made available for use and shall thereafter be retained for use at all times. \r\rReason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",

    "Should the access into the site during construction not be paved, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads.We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.\r",
    "It is highlighted that any proposed works will result in substantial movement of heavy vehicles on the highways, and therefore the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Street Scene Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins.",

    "Please revise all supporting documents if required to reflect the revised descritpion.",
