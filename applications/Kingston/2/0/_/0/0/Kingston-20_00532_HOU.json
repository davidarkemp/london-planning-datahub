    "The applicant is advised that the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Highways Operation Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins. The same team will secure a deposit to ensure that repairing cost is covered should any damage result from the construction associated with this site",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 12 (Secure Cycle Parking) of planning permission 20/03014/PAO2R is hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Inconsistent drawings - having reviewed your plans package as a whole there are inconsistencies as follows:\r\r3D Plans 13 and 15 show the first floor side bathroom window is in a different position compared with the Proposed First Floor Plan. Please check the 3D Plans and revise them to ensure they align with the Proposed Floor Plan.\r\rYou submitted Existing and Proposed Front Elevation plans on the 13th and 24th March (Plan 04). Please can you confirm which is the correct revision as no difference is shown between Existing and Proposed, but they are different between the two revisions. Please also check these against the 3D drawings (Plan 08 and 09).\rIf you are making alterations to the shopfront then this will need to be included in the application.\r\rPlease review the plans to ensure they correlate, amend and resubmit where necessary. Please resubmit only the relevant plan/s.",
