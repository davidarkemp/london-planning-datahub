The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM10 and DM13 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document.",
