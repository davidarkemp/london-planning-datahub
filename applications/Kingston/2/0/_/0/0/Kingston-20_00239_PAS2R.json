    "The proposed change of use from existing workshop (Class B1(c)) to 4 bedroom dwelling house (Class C3) does not fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class PA of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). It is considered that in the absence of a Flood Risk Assessment the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the development would not have an adverse impact on the risk of flooding.\r",
    "Officer's Report - \rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. No objectionshave been received. However, one supporting comment has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development appears to exceed 50% of that of the original house, however taking into account the context of the site and immediate neighbouring properties, there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. Therefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r",
