    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace property. The building is over 2 storeys with the ground floor is used as a barber's shop. The upper floor is used as residential flat.\r\rProposal\rRetention of single storey rear extension to be used as a Cafe - Use Class E(c)\r\rConsultation\r32 Neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r- Noise\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer - No objection\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - Rrequested a condition restricting opening times -  The premises shall not be used by the public for the purposes hereby permitted before 8am and after 11pm Monday to Sunday.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The plans submitted do not correspond with picture that were taken at a site visit. The plans depict a brick structure but the extension appears to be constructed of metal clad and it is not clear what the roof is constructed of. The layout of table chairs plan also does not correspond. It has not been demonstated that the proposed materials used in development would respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area contray to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.   \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:   It has not been possible to establish how the use of the unauthorised structure to the rear would relate to the current use of a barber shop to the front as the Shisha Bar/Cafe appears to have its own separate entrance and signage which does not connect this to the barbers as stated in the planning statement but more as a completely different business. It is not clear what the suggested opening hours will be. It is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of noise and disturbance contray to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
