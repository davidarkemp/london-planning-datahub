    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling on the corner of Highfield Road and Woodside Close.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of side lean-to and rear extension, and erection of single storey rear extension, two storey side extension, and rear dormer roof extension with Juliet balcony and 3nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified and 1 representation has been received neither supporting or objecting to the development. \r\rIssues that have been raised are;\r- Loss of privacy due to the Juliet balcony; and\r- Builders' vehicles creating difficulties for parking and heavy loads damaging roads and pathways.\r\rRegarding highway issues, the applicant would be reminded of their responsibilities to highway safety and damage repair should permission be granted. The issue of privacy will be addressed under neighbouring amenity.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed development would not be compliant with Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD. It is also noted that similar corner properties along Highfield Road have been extended in this way. However, the proposed development would result in a disproportionate and bulky extension and roof form which does not reflect the existing roof pitch which would appear appears \"top-heavy\" and monolithic.  The proposed rear dormer also does not reflect the SPG guidance and the use of render instead of hanging roof tile would exacerbate its prominence within the street scene when viewed to the rear. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to the proposed rear extension, officers note that No. 1 Highfield Road does not benefit from a rear extension, However it is noted that there is currently a garden shed on the patio. The proposed rear extension would measure approximately 4.5m in depth and 3m in height with a flat roof and would be compliant with BRE guidance in relation to the 45 degree rule. With regards to the proposed Juliet balcony, it is not considered that the proposed opening would give rise to further overlooking as the outlook would remain the same as that of the first floor windows. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Positive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Condition 6 of planning permission ref: 21/04089/FUL (Allowed at Appeal ref: APP/Z5630/W/22/3300875) dated 21.12.2022 is as follows:\r\r'Prior to the commencement of the development hereby approved, details of a scheme to enhance the nature conservation interest of the site and an associated program for implementation and management of the same shall be submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved scheme shall be implemented in accordance with the approved programme.'\r\rThe submission includes an Ecological Enhancement Strategy dated April 2023, prepared by David Archer Associates and a Method Statement - Reptiles. The Strategy details native planting which includes shrubs, trees and hedgerows and other enhancements such as a wildlife pond and reedbed. Additionally, 3 Schwegler and/or 2F bat boxes would be installed along with 2 hedgehog houses. The Strategy includes maintenance details.\r\rThe details submitted pursuant to Condition 6 are considered to be acceptable.\r",
    "Condition 10 of planning permission ref: 21/04089/FUL (Allowed at Appeal ref: APP/Z5630/W/22/3300875) dated 21.12.2022 is as follows:\r\r'Notwithstanding the approved drawings and prior to any works above damp proof course level, details shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority indicating the positions, design, materials and type of all boundary treatment, fences and means of enclosures to be erected. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved details prior to the occupation of the dwellings.'\r\rThe details of boundary treatment appear to be shown on 997-L-01, Rev B and 997-L-02. Based on these drawings boundary treatment would comprise hedgerows and shrub mixes. Within the context of Condition 16 which states:  \r\r'Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and re-enacting that Order with or without modification), no additions or enlargements to the dwellinghouse or outbuildings on the site other than those expressly authorised by this permission, or means of enclosure or hardstanding shall be constructed.'\r\rit is considered that the details of hedgerow and shrub mixes to be used as means of enclosure would be acceptable. Were any other means of enclosure to be erected at a later date these would require planning permission.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The impact of the development on character and appearance. \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rThis planning application seeks to obtain planning permission for partial demolition of the existing rear extension, erection of a two-storey side, part two-storey/part single-storey rear and single-storey front porch extension.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of a two-storey side extension. Officers note that the proposed two-storey side extension would only be set down from the ridge line of the existing dwelling house by approximately 300mm. Whilst this aspect would not strictly meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD 2013, which requires two-storey side extensions to be set down from the ridge by at least 500mm to ensure a less prominent appearance in the streetscene, this would not warrant refusal alone as overall it would be a subordinate and proportionate addition.\r\rAdditionally, this extension would not exceed 50% of the width of the original house, it would be set back sufficiently from the front elevation by approximately 1m and would be set in from the boundary by approximately 6.5m (towards the rear) - 3.4m (towards the front). This element is therefore considered to have an acceptable impact in terms of character and appearance.\r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a part two-storey rear extension. Officers acknowledge that this element of the proposal would be of a significant scale and would be visible in the streetscene, as it sited to the rear of the dwelling. However, it would be located on a spacious plot and would blend in well with the existing dwelling, therefore, officers consider that it would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rThe applicant proposes the construction of a single-storey rear extension with a flat roof. Whilst this extension would exceed the recommended depth for single-storey rear extensions, it would appear proportionate to the the host dwelling by maintaining a flat roof height of approximately 2.9m, in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD.\r\rIn regards to the proposed front porch, officers consider it would not significantly affect the character and appearance of the original dwelling or the street generally. Although it would not respect the features of the adjoining property No.90 Lawrence Avenue, the proposal would respect the pitched roof form of the existing roof and would appear subordinate. \r\rTherefore, on balance, officers consider that the proposal would appear proportionate to the original dwellinghouse and therefore would not have an unacceptable impact on its character and appearance. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe proposed two-storey rear/side extension sits at a reasonable distance from neighbouring properties No.90 Lawrence Avenue and No. 35 Kneller Road. In terms of privacy, Policy Guidance 16, of the Residential Design SPD states that a separation distance of 7.5m should be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property. The separating distance between the shared boundary with No.35 Kneller Road and the new habitable room on the first floor would be approximately 7.8m complying with the guidance. \r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension, on the shared boundary with no. 90 Lawrence Avenue, would have a depth of approximately 4.5m and a flat roof height of approximately 2.9m, compared to the existing rear extension with a depth of approximately 5m with a pitched stepped height ranging from approximately 3.5m to 2.5m and an eaves height of approximately 2.4-2m. A rear extension with this depth would usually be considered unacceptable and the eaves height would increase by approximately 900-500mm. However, officers have assessed the effect of the extension on elevation and it is considered that there would be no significant loss of light due to the proposed single-storey rear extension. Additionally, while the eaves height would be higher than existing the overall height of extension would be lower and approximately 0.5m reduced in depth.  On balance, the proposed rear extension would not appear overbearing compared to the existing single-storey rear extension to be demolished.\r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
