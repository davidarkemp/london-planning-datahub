    "The proposed roof extension, by reason of its scale, form, bulk, mass, siting and design, would fail to appear subordinate or proportionate to the host dwelling and would visually unbalance the building of which it forms a part, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would therefore, be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Unless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans",
    "Please provide a revised copy of  block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rPlease note that there is no scale bar on the submitted block plan."
