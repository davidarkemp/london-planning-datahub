    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the proposed windows fitted in the side (west) and rear elevations shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to omit a flat roof skylight and make alterations to the approved rear fenestration. The approved single storey rear extension has a glazed door and separate window on the rear elevation. The sought amendment would replace the window and door with full height french doors and glazing.\r\rIn this case officers consider that an assessment would not have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposed changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey end-terrace dwellinghouse located on Wilson Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation was received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rThese are valid material planning concerns and will be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a two storey side extension, a single storey front extension, as well as the installation of decking to the rear of the site. In line with Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions), the proposed side extension does not appear subordinate to the original dwelling, nor has the roofline been set down from the ridge line of the original dwelling by 500mm. In addition, the front elevation has not been set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house. As such the proposed side extension is not subordinate to the dwellinghouse and would therefore have an unacceptable impact on its character and appearance. \r\rSimilarly, the bulky design and depth of the proposed single storey front extension does not reflect the character of the main house, and would appear as an obvious addition to the property. Furthermore it would not respect the symmetry of the features of the adjoining properties. This element would therefore have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the streetscape. \r\rAs such the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and streetscape. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are 16 & 20 Wilson Road. The proposed single storey front extension and two storey side extension is unlikely to have a significant detrimental impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties. However, the application also proposes decking to the rear of the house. This would be situated on an area of raised ground and would measure a maximum of approximately 0.6 metres in height. When taking into consideration both the raised ground level and the height of the decking, this element of the proposal would have a significant impact on the privacy of the adjoining property at 20 Wilson Road through overlooking the rear garden. As such the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of a neighbouring property.   \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal involves the removal of an existing garage. Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off-street car parking space. As such the proposal is acceptable in relation to the level of car parking. \r\rIn conclusion, by reason of its mass, height and design, the proposed side extension would not appear subordinate to the original dwellinghouse. In addition, by reason of its scale and design, the proposed single storey front extension would appear an incongruous addition to the dwellinghouse. Therefore the proposal would conflict with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. Furthermore, the proposed decking to the rear of the site would have an unacceptable impact on the privacy of the neighbouring property at 20 Wilson Road through overlooking, conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
