    "The proposed erection of side dormers and insertion of roof lights would fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end-of-terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a single storey rear extension and alterations to the roof of the existing two storey outrigger.\r\rThe application form also describes the development as involving \"external insulation\" but these works are not shown clearly on the submitted drawings or described in any of the other submitted documents.\r\rConsultation\r10 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rEnvironment Agency - No comment.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- Flood risk.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rParagraphs 198 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe site is located within the Albert Road / Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character. This is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rThe proposed single storey extension would be large in scale, infilling the space between the existing outrigger and the side boundary of the property and then projecting a further 3m out into the rear garden. Despite this, it would sit comfortably between the existing rear projection at the adjoining neighbour and the small block of flats to the other side. In this context, officers consider that the extension would appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the application property.\r\rThe proposed alteration to the roof of the existing outrigger would add comparatively little bulk to the property. However, the resulting flat roof would be at odds with the hipped main roof of the dwelling and would disrupt the symmetry of the rear facade, which is prominent within the Church Road street scene. Officers consider that this would amount to material harm to the character of the local area and less than substantial harm to the significance of the Albert Road / Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012, insofar as they require development to respond positively to their surroundings. It would also be contrary to policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the Core Strategy 2012, insofar as they require development proposals to preserve the significance of heritage assets.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe scale and siting of the proposed single storey extension would be such that it would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light. While the first floor outrigger is located directly in front of a balcony at the neighbouring block of flats and the alteration to its roof would increase its bulk, the increase would be limited such that officers consider it would not amount to material loss of light or outlook. \r\rOfficers note that the proposal would involve the insertion of new windows at first floor level in the north-eastern flank elevation. However, these would be high level and a condition could be imposed to limit any potentially harmful views from them in the event of an approval.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rThe site lies partly within Flood Zone 2, which indicates that it is at moderate risk from fluvial flooding. The site is at low risk from surface water flooding.\r\rThe application is supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment, which details measures to mitigate against flood risk, including setting the floor levels of the extension no lower than the existing floor levels and running electrical services through the ceiling rather than the floor. Subject to these measures, as well as setting electrical sockets no lower than 750mm above finished floor level, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would not increase the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development, by reason of the proposed flat roof form of the first floor outrigger, would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area and less than substantial harm to the significance of the Albert Road / Victoria Road Local Area of Special Character. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 203 of the NPPF 2021, policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe only benefits to the proposal are those very limited, private benefits associated with enlarging the accommodation at the application property. \r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and on flood risk. These are neutral matters.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
