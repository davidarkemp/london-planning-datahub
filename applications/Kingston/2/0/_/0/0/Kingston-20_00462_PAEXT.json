    "In conclusion and on balance, it is considered that the proposal would result in  an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighboring property No 82, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and  DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document SPD, 2013.",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation. The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the outrigger and would  have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
