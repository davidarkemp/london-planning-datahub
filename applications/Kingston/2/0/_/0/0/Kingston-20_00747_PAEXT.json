    "The proposed single storey rear extension would fall within the parameters of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of single storey rear infill extension and conversion of existing garage into mud-room & storage with associated changes to fenestration.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal. No representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rHistoric England - No consultation considered necessary.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey ground floor extension would infill a small area between the existing rear extensions and would be of an appropriate height, incorporating a pitch roof design, with materials to match the host dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider the development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed extensions would infill an area between the existing rear extensions, with no projection beyond the existing building line to the rear. Having regard to the above officers do not consider the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the amenities for occupants of neighbouring properties.   \r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Despite the loss of the existing garage, as it would not conform with the size parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 it would not constitute a loss in off-street car parking provision on site. Officers note that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate off-street car parking space that is reflective of the existing situation and considered acceptable. No objection is raised to the proposed changes to the fenestration associated with the conversion. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
