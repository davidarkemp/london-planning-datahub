    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows or rooflights in the side elevation (and situated on the first and second floor) shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.",

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 22/00841/HOU:\r- Changing the design of the approved single storey rear extension roof from pitched to flat.\r\rThe proposals would result in a decrease in the overall height, however, the height of the extension would increase in proximity to the neighbouring boundary due to an increased eaves height. The proposed changes and potential impact on neighbouring amenity and character and appearance are therefore considered not to be non-material.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the application be refused.",
    "The submitted location plan has an incorrect scale bar, it measures to 54.2m instead of 40m in 1:1250 scale. Please submit a copy of an Ordnance Survey based site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red, showing at least two road frontages and a North point. Show any other land owned by the applicant that is close to or adjacent to the property outlined in blue."
