    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises No. 8 Hook Road, a former dentist which has been converted into 3 flats (Class C3). The site is located in Southborough Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rConversion of existing internal cycle store into habitable accommodation and erection of single storey outbuilding/shelter (cycle storage) to rear to ground floor flat\r\rConsultation\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comments received\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee: No comments received\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Design and Impact on Heritage Assets; \r- Neighbouring Amenities & Standard of Accommodation; and,\r- Cycle parking\r\rDesign and Impact on Heritage Assets\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted drawings show the floor to ceiling windows to the proposed study/office as 'existing'. It is unclear whether this is a drafting error as the approved fenestration for this room is for a timber window to match existing (refs: 18/16451/COND & 17/16327/FUL). Google Street-View from March 2021 would indicate that the proposed larger windows/patio door is not existing. No details of the proposed materials of this fenestration has been submitted.\r\rRegarding the proposed cycle store, this would be situated to the rear of the site and would not be visible above the approved boundary treatment in that part of the site.\r\rInsufficient information has been submitted in relation to the proposed change in fenestration. It is also note that the window in question fronts onto Hook Road. While there is an existing fence fronting Hook Road, this does not appear to benefit from planning permission either (18/16451/COND & 17/16327/FUL). The change to a larger floor to ceiling window of an unspecified material could adversely impact the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. It has not been demonstrated that the proposed changes would not harm the character and appearance of the existing building or the Conservation Area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities & Standard of Accommodation\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPlanning permission ref: 17/16327/FUL for the redevelopment of the site for residential accommodation noted a shortfall in private and communal amenity space provision. It was considered that, on balance, the under-provision would be acceptable given the benefits of the scheme.\r\rThe proposed cycle store would be placed in the rear communal amenity space with a footprint of approximately 4sqm, thereby reducing the communal amenity space further to approximately 50sqm (a shortfall of approximately 27sqm of amenity space provision for the site). It is also noted that the cycle store would be positioned in place of approved landscaping and planting (17/16327/FUL), although this does not appear to have been implemented either.\r\rThe existing ground floor flat has its own private amenity space and its Gross Internal Area (GIA) of 77sqm would accord with the requirements of Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021). The proposal would therefore harm levels of amenity space for the development as a whole to provide additional internal space for the ground floor flat which has its own private amenity space and complies with the London Plan (2021) space standards.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would result in an unacceptable loss of communal amenity space for the development as a whole, which would harm the residential amenities of the neighbouring flats. This would not be outweighed by the benefit of providing the ground floor flat which meets the London Plan (2021) minimum space standards and has its own private amenity space, with additional habitable accommodation.\r\rCycle Parking\rThe existing cycle storage area is within the building itself and it considered to provide safe and secure cycle storage which would support and promote the use of sustainable modes of travel, in accordance with Policy DM8 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\rThe relocation of the cycle store to the rear communal amenity space would be less secure than the current arrangement which could discourage residents from using the cycle as a mode of transport. This would be a disbenefit of the scheme.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Southborough Conservation Area through the proposed change in fenestration and the lack of detailing of the proposed materials. The identified harm would be less than substantial and there would be no public benefit resulting from the proposal.\r\rThe proposed bike store would further reduce the communal amenity space to the rear which is used by the other flats within the flatted development; this would harm the residential amenities and standard of accommodation of neighbouring flats within the development. The removal of the integral cycle store and its replacement with a cycle store to the rear would be a retrograde step in terms of secure cycle parking and would likely discourage the uptake of more sustainable modes of travel.\r\rFor the reasons set out above, it is recommended that the planning application is refused.\r",
