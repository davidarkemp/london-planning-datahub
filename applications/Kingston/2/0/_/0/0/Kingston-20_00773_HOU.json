    "By virtue of its design, scale and mass, the proposed mansard dormer roof extension would appear as an excessively large and  incongruous addition that would harm the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house which shows an existing bay to the rear. The proposed extension would therefore extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Please provide a plan or sketch showing the location of the trees within the site or immediately adjoining the site."
