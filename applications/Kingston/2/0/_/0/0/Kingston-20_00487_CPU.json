    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2no rooflights to front roofslope to facilitate loft conversion  falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended)",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed hip-to-gable roof extension would not be in keeping with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, as it would unbalance the roof forms of the pair of semi-detached properties, given that the proposal could be completed under permitted development, officers consider that this would be a credible fallback position.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer extension would not be in keeping with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD as it would not be set up from the eaves, set down from the ride, or set in from the sides of the roofslope. As such, officers consider the proposed extension would be at odds with the existing roof as it would appear a bulky and dominant addition to the host property, further given the scale and inappropriate design it would appear an incongruous addition within the surrounding area that would not be in keeping with the prevailing pattern of form of development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proximity of the proposed development in relation to the closest habitable windows of neighbouring properties, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \rWhile there is an opening proposed to the side elevation of the dwelling at second floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure the windows is obscure-glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels, as such the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed rear dormer extension would appear an excessive and incongruous addition to the host dwelling that would result in harm to the character and appearance of the original building and surrounding area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
