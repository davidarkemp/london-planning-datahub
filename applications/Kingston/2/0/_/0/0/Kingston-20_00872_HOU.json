    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time be placed in the west elevation of the extensions hereby permitted without the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows or rooflights in the east and west elevations, and situated on the first floor and the loft floor level, shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, a privacy screen of 1.7 metres shall be erected along the eastern edge of the raised decking, the privacy screen shall provide a level of obscurity to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on the western side of Bradlands Way.\r\rIt is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  While the proposed extension would be viewed from the front elevation at certain angles, and would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013, given that it would have a flat roof (unlike the roof forms of the existing property), Officers note that similar flat roofs on first floor extensions are evident in the immediate surrounding area. Therefore, it is considered that it would not appear as an incongruous addition, or have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the streetscene. Further, the development would have a modest width, be set back appropriately from the front elevation and would maintain the eaves of the original roof slope, which would be in keeping with the host dwelling. Overall, Officers consider that the proposed development would be acceptable in character and appearance terms.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development and that it would be set in from the shared boundaries, and that no windows are proposed on the northern flank wall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for Condition 5 (Cycle Parking) of planning permission 21/01223/HOU has been assessed by relevant consultants and is hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for Conditions 3 (Acoustic Report) and 4 (Extraction System) of planning permission 21/02781/FUL have been assessed by relevant consultants and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.",
    "The application site is located on the pavement on the junction of Palace Road and Portsmouth Road, Kingston. \r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in character and appearance. The site is located in the designated Riverside South Conservation Area. The immediate surrounding buildings and curtilage/land are not statutorily or locally listed. \r\r5 objections have been received objecting to the siting and appearance of the proposed telecoms apparatus.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of a proposed slim line phase 8 monopole with wraparound cabinet at base, 3no. additional ancillary equipment cabinets and associated ancillary works\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) 1990 Act, the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe proposed telecom apparatus would be sited in a highly visible location on the juncture of Palace Road and Portsmouth Road Kingston and opposite and adjacent to a number of residential properties and adjacent the well used public realm of the Queens Promenade (Kingston Riverside).\r\rThe height of the mast would be 15m which would be in excess of 5 to 7m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical other such perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed telecoms equipment would be sited in the designated heritage asset of the Riverside South Conservation Area. Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would provide the benefit of an improved telecoms offer in the area this benefit does not outweigh the disbenefit of the less than substantial harm caused by the proposal in its failure to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the conservation area.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance of the telecoms apparatus would be inappropriate in this case and it is recommended that prior approval be refused as it would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, paragraphs 194 - 209 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits. \r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for Condition 6 (Construction Management Plan) of Planning Permission 19/00439/FUL has been assessed by relevant consultants and is hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.",
    "Site\rThe application site comprises a dwellinghouse located on Dinton Road. The site is located within the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC)-a non-designated heritage asset and a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ).\r\rConsultations\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation was received from a neighbouring property SUPPORTING the proposal (no reasons fro this support were given).\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road Strategic Area of Special Character; and,\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that the proposed development would relate well to the host dwelling and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the immediate surrounding area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficers Comments: As stated above the site falls within the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road SASC, a non-designated heritage asset. As also stated above the proposed development is considered to relate well to the original dwelling and the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Wyndham Road/Bockhampton Road SASC.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposed development would not result in any unacceptable loss of garden land and would continue to provide a good quantum of private outdoor amenity space for existing and future occupiers.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
