    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Watching Brief\r\rA watching brief involves the proactive engagement with the development groundworks to permit investigation and recording of features of archaeological interest which are revealed. A suitable working method with contingency arrangements for significant discoveries will need to be agreed. The outcome will be a report and archive.\r\rAll below ground works should be monitored by an archaeologist. Including, but not limited to: top soil stripping, removal of existing foundations, ground reduction for new foundations and services, and landscaping.\r\rYou can find more information on archaeology and planning in Greater London on their website\r\r",
    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear/side wraparound extension would extend to 4m in depth. While this depth is not recommended by the Residential Design SPD for terraced dwellings (4 v 3-3.5m depth), given that both neighbouring properties enjoy existing rear extensions of similar depth it would not appear out of keeping with the immediate surrounding area. The proposed two storey rear extension would continue the existing roof form of the original dwelling and would continue the line of the existing side elevation of the two storey rear projection. It would be modest in depth and as such would be a proportionate addition to the host property.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that no side facing windows are proposed to the two storey rear extension, or single storey side extension, there are no adverse impacts to privacy for adjoining neighbouring properties. Further, given that both neighbouring properties benefit from existing single storey rear extensions, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of sunlight/light. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, with a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rThe submitted site plan does not show the proposed development in hatched or shaded.",
    "Please provide copies of proposed south and east elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rThere are two different sets of proposed south and east elevations in the submitted documents. We require only one proposed south and east elevation relevant to this application"
