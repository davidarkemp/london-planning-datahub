    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The finished floor levels of the development to which this permission relates shall be no lower than those of the existing building(s) and any electrical sockets or other electrical fittings within the development shall be installed no lower than 750mm above finished floor level.\r\rReason: To mitigate the risks associated with flooding of the site, in accordance with policy 5.12 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS1 and DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\r\rInstallation of modular ramp to allow front entrance access\r\rConsultation\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ramp, platform and railings would be to the rear of the property and not visible to the street scene. It is noted that the ramp is required to allow safer access to the dwelling for the occupant. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not give rise to any unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area given its transient appearance and domestic scale.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling located on the south eastern side of Borough Road. The site falls within the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset).\r\rProposal\rThe proposal relates to the erection of a L-shaped rear dormer with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r13 Neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposed extension would be in keeping with the host dwelling. Officers also note that a number of adjoing properties have benefitted from similar roof extensions. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Whilst it is considered that the proposed extension would result in some loss of light to the nearest bedroom window at loft level of No. 10 Borough Road, it is considered this loss would be acceptable as it does not breach BRE guidelines and would not affect the principal window of the bedroom.  Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rAs stated above the Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that Officers consider that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. Overall, the proposed development is considered to preserve the character and appearance and significance of The Princess Road, Arthur Road and Borough Road Local Area of Special Character.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The assessment of this application has been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings. If you carry out development based on incorrect plans you may be liable to the Council taking enforcement action against you.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 comment in support of the application has been received. Within the letter of support concerns were raised in relation to the capacity of shared foul and surface water drainage as a result of the proposed development. However, these issues would not be material planning considerations for an extension of the scale proposed.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension and alterations to the front elevation are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the main dwelling or the immediate surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposed first floor rear extension would not pass the 45-degree rule test in elevation view, it would pass the 45 degre rule test in plan view in relation to the closest habitable windows at ground and first floor level at No. 81 Manor Drive North. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 81 Manor Drive North by reason of loss of light. The proposed extension is considered not to be materially more overbearing than the existing situation.\r\rGiven the separation distance between the proposed development and No.77 Manor Drive North, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No.77 Manor Drive North by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. \r\rWhile the proposal would alter the size and position of windows to the south eastern side elevation at first floor level, given that they would offer similar views to the existing, officers consider that it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rThere would be no unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of noise and disturbance.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
