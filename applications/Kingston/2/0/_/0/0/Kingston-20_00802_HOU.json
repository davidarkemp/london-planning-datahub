    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the first floor bathroom windows in the side (east) elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and internal alteration\r\rConsultation\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the existing situation between the development site and its adjoining neighbours, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Barnsbury Close. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r37 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; and, \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a hip to gable roof extension. Proposals for hip to gable roof extensions are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. However, the application site already benefits from a large two-storey front/rear extension, which significantly unbalances the pair of semi-detached properties. It is considered that as these properties are already unbalanced, the proposed hip to gable roof extension would not significantly increase the visual bulk of the dwellinghouse, or significantly further unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings.\r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension to the rear roofslope. When designing a roof extension it is important to ensure that the addition of a dormer window complements the original design of the house (particularly the roof form). In many cases it should be possible to design dormer windows so that they allow the conversion of a loft space, but do not dominate the form of the existing roof. The proposed dormer extension would not be set down from the ridge of the roof, or set in from the eaves and sides of the roof by 500mm as required by Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013. Additionally, the proposed dormer would span the entire width of the rear slope. When taking into account these factors, the proposed dormer extension would appear dominant within the rear roofslope and would not respect the existing character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rThe proposed alterations to the roof of the rear single storey extension are considered to be acceptable in relation the the impact they would have on the character and appearance of the dwelling. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider in relation to amenity is 31 Barnsbury Close. This neighbouring property has not been extended to the rear. The application site benefits from an existing rear extension on the boundary with this neighbouring property, which measures approximately 2.5 metres in height. The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension with a parapet wall measuring approximately 3.3 metres in height. Officers consider that the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed increase in height of the single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at 31 Barnsbury Close in terms of daylight/sunlight.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r5x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would be an infill extension to the rear of the property. The proposal would replace an existing glazed rear/side addition. The proposed ground floor rear extension, would have no significant impact on the streetscene and would also appear to be a subordinate addition to the rear of the host property.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, its proportionate and subordiate design and the fact that it would replace an existing extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy, overbearing appearance, or loss of light.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Elm Road. The site is sited within a Controlled Parking Zone. \r\rConsultations\r\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey side/rear extension, first floor rear extension, a rear dormer extension and the installation of 2 rooflights. \r\rThe proposed single storey side/rear extension would measure approximately 7.2 metres in depth. This would be a flat roof extension and would measure approximately 3.2 metres in height. The Residential SPD recommends that single storey extensions should not exceed 3-3.5 metres in depth for a semi-detached house, and should not exceed 3 metres in height. Whilst the proposed extension would not meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, the proposed extension would not be uncharacteristic and would still appear proportional and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. \r\rThe proposed first floor extension and installation of rooflights are considered to have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse. \r\rThe proposed dormer extension to the rear would not meet the requirements as laid out by the Residential Design SPD, as it has not been sufficiently set down from the ridgeline nor set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by 500mm. However Officers consider that the proposed development would not be uncharacteristic of the area given the development at the adjoining property, and therefore would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to be considered in relation to amenity is 190 Elm Road. A 45 degree line taken from the centre of the closest principle room window of this neighbouring property would intersect the proposed extension. However, between the proposed development and this neighbouring window is a distance of approximately 2.7 metres. Due to the separation between the proposed development and the neighbouring property, the proposed development would have a limited impact on the light and outlook of the principal room of the neighbouring property at 190 Elm Road.\r\rFurthermore it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance. Additionally, whilst the application proposes the installation of a window on the side elevation of the existing dwellinghouse, as this is a relocation of an existing window to a more central location, officers do not consider this element to lead to a substantial loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
