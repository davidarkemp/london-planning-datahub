    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates, any windows or rooflights at first floor level or above in the northern (flank) elevation shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and permanently retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable, tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) (or any Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification), no windows shall be inserted nor any other openings formed (other than those expressly authorised by this permission) at first floor level or above in the in the northern (flank) elevation of the dwelling unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling and is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal involves the demolition of the existing rear conservatory, the erection of a part two storey, part single storey rear extension including rear Juliet balcony in first floor and a new front porch.\r\rConsultation\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one objection has been received raising the following summarised concerns:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings; and,\r- Privacy.\r\rThis will be addressed within the report.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the varied front building line along Norbiton Avenue and consistent roof height with the existing garage it is considered that the proposed front porch would not be out of keeping with the host property, or result in any harm with regard to character and appearance. The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension and Juliet balcony would not be visible from the front of the property and would relate well to the host property. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the siting of the proposed extensions in relation to the neighbouring properties it is considered that the proposed development would not result in any unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring amenity. The proposed Juliet balcony at first floor level would offer the same views as current windows at first floor level and therefore there would be no material loss of privacy. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The applicant is reminded that the proposed outbuilding must be incidental to the main dwellinghouse and not used as a separate unit of accommodation. A purpose incidental to a dwellinghouse would not cover normal residential uses, such as separate self-contained accommodation or the use of an outbuilding for primary living accommodation such as a bedroom, bathroom, or kitchen.",
    "Site\rThe application relates to a two storey semi detached dwelling on the southern side of Norbiton Avenue. \r\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rRoof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony, installation of 3 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultations\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; and, \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes a roof extension that would retain a hipped element, however officers acknowledge that it would not match the roof forms of either neighbouring property, one an original hipped roof, the other a gable end roof. Whilst the proposed roof extension would somewhat unbalance the appearance of the pair of semi-detached dwellings the application site forms part of, officers note that a variety of roof forms can be seen along Norton Avenue and within the immediate surrounding area. Therefore, the proposed roof extension in this case would not appear out of character with the immediate surrounding area.\r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension to the rear. Whilst this element would not entirely meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, 2013 it would be reflective of other rear dormers in the immediate vicinity in terms of scale and design. The proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the immediate surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
