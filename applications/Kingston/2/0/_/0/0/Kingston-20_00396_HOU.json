    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the completed development hereby permitted, the three ground floor windows (serving the kitchen) to the side (eastern) elevation within the permitted side extension, shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with and retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale.

    "The site comprises a  two storey detached dwelling located on the southern side of Shortlands Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rErection of  single-storey rear extension, and two-storey side extension with associated changes to fenestration. Rear piggyback loft extension with installation of 6no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of an existing conservatory and erection of single-storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration. Rear piggyback roof extension with chimney stack removal and installation of 6no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received objecting to the location of the proposed bathroom at ground floor level. This matter will be addressed in the report below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would accord with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD and would be set back sufficiently from both neighbouring properties, and would not be uncharacteristic of ground floor development to the rear of properties in Shortlands Road. \r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would align with the proposed single storey rear extension at ground level, maintain the existing setback from the boundary and would be setback above to align with the existing first floor rear extension, and first floor development to the neighbouring properties.\r\rThe piggyback extension would be setback in accordance with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, including eave and ridge height, rooflights, distance from neighbouring dwellings and no inclusion of dormer windows. \r\rAll extensions would utilise external materials to match the host dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area would be acceptable. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed bathroom at ground floor level immediately adjacent to the rear garden of No,86 would have a window to its flank elevation. To ensure the amenities of No.86 a condition will require this window to be fixed and obscured.\r\rOtherwise, given the scale, siting and design of the proposed development, it is not considered the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r14x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rPROPOSAL\rThe application seeks the Removal of existing front boundary treatments to be replaced with a new boundary wall, fencing and gate.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the current Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe key planning considerations relevant in the assessment of this application are set out under the headings below:\r\rImpact on the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area:\r\rNPPF attaches great importance to the design of the built environment. Paragraph 134 states that permission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment. Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (Including House Extensions) states that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design.\r\rThe most essential elements are identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced and includes the following:\r\r - Prevailing density of the surrounding area;\r - Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms), massing;\r -  Plot width and format which includes spaces between buildings;\r - Building line build up, set back and front boundary; and\r - Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and the design detailing of elevation.\r\rPolicy Guidance 44 (Walls and Enclosures) of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013) is the most relevant to the proposal.\rWalls and enclosures are a characteristic feature of many of the Borough's streets across many of the common housing types. They provide a boundary to the curtilage of a property as well as providing some screening to safeguard privacy. Walls and enclosures should be in keeping with character of the street and surrounding area. The design, materials and height of walls and enclosures should relate well to other enclosures in the area.\r\rAlterations to, and the erection of walls, fences and gates often do not require planning consent. However, if the Permitted Development rights associated with a property have been removed or if the wall or fence proposed exceed 1 metre adjacent to a highway, or 2 metres above elsewhere, then planning consent is required.\r\rWhen designing walls or enclosures, attention should be paid to the form and detail of existing enclosures on the street so that new walls do not appear out of character. Materials should be chosen to match the materials upon the host building. If there is an established hedgerow which forms a strong boundary characteristic of the streetscene it should be a retained where possible. If gates are proposed as part of the scheme they should swing inwards and adequate visibility of pedestrians and vehicles should be maintained for all vehicles entering and exiting the property.\r\rThe original the property is served by a 1 metre high timber fence without gates. The application seeks to replace the existing with a new 1.5 metre high boundary wall, fencing and gates. It is noted that front boundary treatment in the vicinity comprises a mixture of low level fences, low level brick walls/fences as well as hedging/shrub planting. As such, the higher boundary treatment proposed would appear out of character with the lower-level boundary treatment elsewhere along Ely Close. The replacement wall and fencing would have a dominant appearance within the street scene and would appear visually intrusive. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, as well as the streetscene and surrounding area and therefore would not accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012. The notional security benefits of the proposal would not outweigh the harms identified above.\r\rImpact on the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers:\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's LDD Core Strategy (2012) seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, daylight /sunlight, noise and disturbance.\r\rThe scheme would have no significant impact on neighbouring amenities, in terms of privacy, outlook, daylight /sunlight, noise and disturbance.\r\r5. RECOMMENDATION\rRefuse for the following reason:\rThe height and materials of the proposed boundary wall, fencing and gates, would appear unduly prominent and visually intrusive in the streetscene and surrounding area. The proposed development would also be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the host property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r",
