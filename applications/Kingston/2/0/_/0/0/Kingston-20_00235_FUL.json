    "The proposal would involve the loss of an existing office in a location within Kingston Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. No  robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the property has been actively marketed. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policy DM17 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
    "By virtue of the lack of private external amenity space, the proposed development would result in a substandard form of residential accommodation for future occupants. The proposal would therefore be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013). \r",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the Council that the proposal could provide on-site bicycle parking provision in accordance with Policy 6.9 of the London Plan (2016) and the Council's Sustainable Transport Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure and congestion in surrounding streets.  As such, the proposal is considered to conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the adopted Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Condition 8 (Architectural Detailing) - Officers have reviewed the information submitted and are satisfied that the architectural detailing of the balconies, windows, doors, overhangs, rainwater goods, ducts, fans and louvres and their associated reveals and their relationship with the walls/fascias will ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 8 (Architectural Detailing) of Planning Permission 20/02219/CREG3 are hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008",
    "The site is located in Kingston Town Centre. The site is not located in a conversation area.\r\rThe application seeks to display 2no.x externally illuminated Fascia signs.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the proposal on highway safety; and,\r\rAmenity \rThe proposed installation of replacement internally lit double sided advertisement sign by virtue of its sitting in a prominent position in the public highway and tall appearance would lead to an incongruous addition to the streetscene. This would be visually intrusive creating visual street clutter, detracting from the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPublic safety\rThe proposed advertisement display would be static. It would not obstruct any highway signs and would not impede the free flow of vehicle or pedestrian movement. The advertisement would not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety.\r\r\rIn conclusion the proposal would not accord with section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Please confirm the description ''Display of 3no internally illuminated fascia sign, 2 no non illuminated fascia sign and 6 nos vinyl window sign.''",
    "Please provide existing and proposed floor plans to show the position of advert at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rThe submitted elevations do not have a scale bar. Please show the complete proposed elevations to show the display of the signage.",
    "Please provide 1 copy of drawing to a scale of 1:50 or 1:100, of the elevation(s) of the proposed sign in colour showing the method of illumination (if applicable) and a drawing showing a section through sign.\r\rThe submitted details do not have a scale bar and section."
