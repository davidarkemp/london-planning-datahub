It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed hip-to-gable extension roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that it would unbalance the roofs of the semi-detached properties, however given that a a number of similar extensions are viewed within the Rowlls Road streetscene, officers consider it would not detract from the character and appearance of the original dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extensions would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that it would not be appropriately set down from the ridge of the original roofslope, or in from the eaves or sides of the roofslope, however given that a a number of similar extensions are viewed within the Rowlls Road streetscene, officers consider it would not detract from the character and appearance of the original dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed extensions in relation to the neighbouring properties, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwelling house located on the southern side of Croylands Drive. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received objecting to the proposal on the following grounds:\r\rNoise, dirt and pollution created by the proposed development.\r\rThe above issues would be limited to the construction phase and managed through building regulations and other legislation to minimise impacts beyond the application property. \r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; and, \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed extension would replace an existing conservatory with a single storey rear extension, with a stepped appearance projecting further on one side than the other. The pitched roof extension would be of an appropriate scale, with external materials to match the existing property. The extension would align with the neighbouring rear extension at No.13 Croylands Drive and maintain the existing setback to No.11.  It would not be visible from the street and would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider are Nos.11 and 13 Croylands Drive. \r\rThe neighbouring property at No. 13 Croylands Drive has been extended to the rear and the proposed rear extension would match the building line of this property. To No.11 Croylands Drive the proposal would maintain its existing setback from the shared boundary, and given the modest projection of the extension at this point. Officers therefore consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of any neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non designated heritage asset).\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey front porch, side and rear extension.\r\rOfficers note that planning permission was previously granted (19/02765/HOU dated 10/01/2020) for the erection of a a single storey side/rear extension with associated works which is already under construction. This application would be for a similar development with the addition of a porch to the front of the property.\r\rConsultation\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the property currently has a small flat roofed porch. Therefore, the proposed extensions and alterations to the front of the property would not be completely dissimilar to the existing situation. In combination the proposed extensions to the front, side and rear would not be of an insignificant scale, however, they would be in keeping with the host dwelling and would result in no harm the character or appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rAs stated above the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.  \r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF states that:\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment: As set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that Officers consider that there would be no harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey end of terrace dwellinghouse located on Tolworth Road. The site is located within Flood Zone 2 (medium probability).\r\rProposal\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of existing garage, erection of two storey side and rear timber canopy extension. Alteration to existing rear extension including installation of 1 no rooflight. Installation of pv panels in rear roof.\r\rRelevant History\r21/03037/HOU - Demolition of existing garage and erection of two-storey side extension. Alterations to existing rear extension including changes to fenestration and installation of 1no rooflight. Installation of PV panels to rear roof. Erection of rear timber canopy. \r\rThis previous application was refused for the following reason:\r\rBy reason of its siting, mass and height the side extension would appear disproportionate to the original dwelling and would appear excessive in scale and dominant within the immediate streetscene. In addition, the proposed extension would not be set in from the boundary and could therefore lead to a terracing effect between properties. The proposal would have an unacceptable impact upon the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rConsultations\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\rThe impact of the development on highways; and,\rThe impact of the development on flood risk. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers note that the proposed two storey side extension would not be set back from the front elevation, or set down from the ridgeline of the roof by 500mm as recommended by the Residential Design SPD 2013. Nor would it be set in sufficiently from the boundary in accordance with the Council's guidance. Officers note that the proposed extension would be set in marginally from the boundary by approximately 0.3 metres and acknowledge that there is an access path between the property at No. 117 Tolworth Road and its neighbour and No. 115 Tolworth Road. Due to this slight set in, in conjunction with the site's proximity to the access path, the proposed extensions are unlikely to lead to a terracing effect. However, officers consider that the proposed two storey side extension would appear disproportionate to the original dwelling and would appear excessive in scale and dominant within the immediate streetscene. As such, Officers consider that the previous reason for refusal in relation to application 21/03037/HOU has not been adequately addressed.\r\rThe other aspects of the proposal are considered acceptable in character and appearance terms.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The proposal involves the removal of an existing garage. Despite this loss, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least two off-street car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, this issue would not warrant a reason for refusal as it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rIn terms of cycle parking Officers note that due to the loss of the garage and the side access to the rear of the property, it is unclear as to how secure cycle parking storage would be accommodated on site in accordance with the standards set out in the London Plan. In the event of an approval it is considered appropriate to require these details via condition to ensure compliance.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within Flood Zone 2, which has a medium probability of flooding. The submitted flood risk assessment states that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than existing floor levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate. This is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion and overall the proposed development would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
