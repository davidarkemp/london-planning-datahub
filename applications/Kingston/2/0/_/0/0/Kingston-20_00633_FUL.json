    "PREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY:\rApplication reference 20/01700/FUL - Erection of a two storey detached house and detached linked two storey annex with single storey detached garage (following demolition of existing house, garage, surrounding terraces and annex building). Granted planning permission, dated 06.11.2020.\r\rApplication reference 21/03092/CLC - Details required for Conditions 13 (Landscaping Scheme) 14 (Refuse and Recycling) and 15 (Cycle Storage) of planning permission 20/01700/FUL (Erection of a two storey detached house and detached linked two storey annex with single storey detached garage (following demolition of existing house, garage, surrounding terraces and annex building)). Application refused, dated 19 November 2021. \r\rApplication reference: 21/02905/FUL - Application under Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to amend Condition 1 (Approved Plans) and Condition 5 (Fenestration) of planning permission ref: 20/01700/FUL (Erection of a two storey detached house and detached linked two storey annex with single storey detached garage (following demolition of existing house, garage, surrounding terraces and annex building) dated 06/11/2020. Variation to include alterations to layout and footprint at ground floor level, lowering eaves line and changes to elevations (Condition 1) and alter the wording of Condition 5 removing the words referring to the study from the condition. Application granted, dated 14 December 2021.\r\rCONSULTATIONS:\r42no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No objections have been received. \r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe application site is a substantial detached house on the western side of Warren Park. \r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character. \r\rThe site is not statutory listed or locally listed. The site falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and lies immediately adjacent to Coombe House Conservation Area. \r\rPROPOSAL\rThis Section 73 application seeks variation to include Condition 6 of planning permission reference 21/02905/FUL to be omitted as rear balcony of west wing is removed, balcony of main dwelling reduced in size, and the rear terraces now proposed at lower level.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe variation to the approved plans include:\r\r- Removal of condition 6 (privacy screens)\r\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development, the resulting impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area, the impact of the development on heritage assets and the impact of the development on amenities of neighbouring residents. \r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission.\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe rear / side balcony to the western wing (closest to the western boundary) has been omitted from the scheme. As such, there is now no requirement to screen along the western side.\r\rThe proposed balcony off the main body of the dwelling to the rear and servicing bedrooms 1, 2 and 3 has been considerably reduced in size. Officers note it is located well within the site with distances from boundaries, in particular the western boundary. Officers also note the presence of tree screening along the boundary.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and area.\r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset) and lies immediately adjacent to but outside of the boundaries of the Coombe House Conservation Area. The surrounding character of the area is residential with relatively large, detached dwellinghouses within individual plots. Nearby dwellinghouses are a mix of contemporary mansion-style homes and properties built in the Arts and Crafts style. The estate retains its original mature landscaping.\r\rAs noted above, officers consider that the proposed amendments would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. Likewise officers consider that the proposed development would not affect the setting of the adjacent conservation area or the non-designated heritage asset of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character or otherwise harm either assets' significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal.\r\rResidential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers note that when the original scheme was determined, the planning officer assessing the proposals acknowledged the provision of large balconies which would wrap around the rear and western sides of the dwelling at first floor level. These balconies would be in excess of 21m from the neighbouring property to the north and this, together with the dense vegetation along the boundaries of the property, culminated in assessment that the balconies as originally proposed would not give rise to materially harmful loss of privacy. \r\rThe condition for privacy screens was attached however to ensure that the balconies be screened along their western edges to prevent views into the grounds of the neighbouring Coombe Hill School. \r\rAs mentioned above, the rear/side balcony to the western wing (closest to the western boundary) has been omitted from the scheme. Furthermore, the proposed balcony off the main body of the dwelling to the rear and servicing bedrooms 1, 2 and 3 has been considerably reduced in size. Officers note it is located well within the site with distances from boundaries, in particular the western boundary. Officers also note the presence of tree screening along the boundary.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed removal of Condition 6 (Privacy Screens) of Planning Permission ref: 21/02905/FUL are considered to maintain high design quality appropriate for its setting within a Strategic Area of Special Character and adjacent to a Conservation Area. The proposals are considered to comply with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.  \r\rRECOMMENDATION\rGrant planning permission.\r",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey detached dwelling house located on the northern side of Rodney Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for demolition of existing rear conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension. The agent has confirmed there will be no changes to the existing patio level.\r\r\rConsultations\r23 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; and, \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed extension would replace an existing conservatory with a single storey full width rear extension. Although beyond the parameters of the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, the proposed flat roof extension would be of an appropriate scale with external materials to match the existing property and of a depth that reflects the established pattern of development within the surrounding area.  It would not be visible from the street and would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider are Nos.16 and 20 Rodney Road.   \r\rThe neighbouring property at No.20 Rodney Road has been extended to the rear and the proposed rear extension would be of a similar depth, scale and design. The proposed extension would be an additional 1m as it relates to this property however is considered modest given the existing extension to No.16 Rodney Road and the separation distance.   Officers therefore consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of any neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
