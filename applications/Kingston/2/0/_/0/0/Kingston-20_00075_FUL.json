    "Based on the limited information that has been submitted, it is considered that the proposed uPVC windows would not preserve or enhance the character or appearance of the Conservation Area.  The public benefits of the scheme would not outweigh the less than substantial harm caused by the proposed development. As such, the proposal fails to meet the statutory requirements in Section 72(1) of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990, and would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and  Policies DM10, DM12 and CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012). \r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation has been received in support of this application. \r\rThe neighbourhood traffic engineer was consulted and no objections was raised in regards to the proposed scheme.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the garage conversion would be visible from the streetscene by way of the garage door replacement with a new window however, the proposed front elevation window would be in keeping with the fenestration pattern of the main dwelling and the surrounding locality which would adequately integrate into the streetscene. It is considered the proposal would not cause significant negative impact to the streetscene of Tangmere Grove.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proportionate and subordinate nature of the proposed development and its proximity in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
