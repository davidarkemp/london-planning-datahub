    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed extension would alter access arrangements to the rear garage, at present the splay in the rear wall would assit with access to the garage. No information in front of Officers would demonstrate that access would be prevented with the proposed extension. In any event there is parking to be found at the front of the dwelling. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest depth of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Northcote Avenue. The site is situated within Flood Zone 2/3 (medium probability).\r\rPlanning History\r\r21/01686/CPU - Demolition of existing detached outbuilding and erection of new single storey enlarged detached outbuilding. Application Granted on 19 Jul 2021. With conditions.\r\r04/16135/FUL - Erection of single storey side extension incorporating garage and kitchen extension and front porch. Application Granted on 18 May 2004. With conditions.\r\r03/16056/FUL - Erection of single storey side extension incorporating garage and front porch. Refuse on 26 Mar 2003\r\r02/16151/LDP - A change in roof profile from hip to gable and the erection of a projecting rear dormer (LDC/P). Application Granted on 16 Sep 2002.\r\rConsultations\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on drainage. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a first floor side extension, above an existing single storey side extension. This extension would be set back from the front elevation of the dwelling and set down from the ridge line. Furthermore, the proposed extension would not exceed 50% of the width of the original dwelling. Whilst the proposed first floor side extension would not be set down in line with the recommended 500mm as outlined by the Residential Design Guide, Officers note that the extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse and would therefore have an acceptable impact on its character and appearance.\r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension, in place of an existing conservatory. This extension would measure approximately 4 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse and would have a flat which would measure a maximum of 3 metres in height. Officers consider that this extension would also appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse and would therefore have an acceptable impact on its character and appearance.\r\rFinally the application proposes 4 no. solar panels. The proposed solar panels will be fixed on an angled support frame, such that they would sit approximately 280mm above the top of the flat roof of an existing dormer extension. The proposed changes are considered acceptable in terms of their design and would result in a negligible impact on the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and wider streetscene.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficers Comments: \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.
