    "The proposed gable roof forms would result in the loss of symmetry between the pair of semi-detached dwellings at numbers 139 and 141 Hook Rise South, Chessington KT6 7NA. The proposed first floor front infill extension would result in a form of development that would fail to appear subservient to the host dwelling. The proposed rear dormer would be excessive in size. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012) and paragraph 4.29  and Policy Guidance 36 and 39  of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
