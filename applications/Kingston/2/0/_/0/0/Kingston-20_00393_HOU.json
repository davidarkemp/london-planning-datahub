    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the building shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The rating level of the air conditioning equipment hereby approved as part of this development will be at least 5dB below the background level as measured from the nearest sensitive facades, during the relevant periods of operation.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of adjoining residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Prior to use, machinery, plant or equipment/extraction/ventilation system and ducting at the development shall be mounted with proprietary anti-vibration isolators and fan motors shall be vibration isolated from the casing and adequately silenced and maintained as such. \r\rReason: To ensure that the amenity of occupiers of the development site/surrounding premises is not adversely affected by vibration noise, in accordance with policy 7.15 of the London Plan, 2016. \r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details for Condition 17 (Car Charging Points) 17/15107/FUL have been assessed and are hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the approved details.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations from a singular household have been received relating to construction management and parking capacity. Officers note that parking is not restricted within Lynton Road and surrounding streets and as such officers consider that there will be sufficient parking for additional vehicles.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed single storey side extension would not be set back from the front elevation, and would have a slightly unusual roof form, it would be appropriately set in form the shared boundary and would have a modest footprint. As such, officers consider that it would appear a subordinate addition, and that it would not appear an incongruous addition to the appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rWhile the proposed outbuilding to the rear would have a considerable footprint, it would be set in from the shared boundaries, and would have a modest height, and as such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed single storey rear and side extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFurther, given the separation distance from the proposed outbuilding to the rear and the flank elevation of the neighbouring property to the south, officers note that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
