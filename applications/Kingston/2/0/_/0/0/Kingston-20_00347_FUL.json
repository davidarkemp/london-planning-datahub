    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Clayton Road. The site is situated within Flood Zone 2.\r\rConsultations\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation was received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds of:\r- Inaccurate plans\r\rThe initially submitted proposed plans were inaccurate, as they showed the proposed dormer extension extending beyond the boundary of the property and onto the rear roofslope of the adjoining property. Accurate plans have since been submitted. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes a hip to gable roof conversion. Proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. The adjoining property at No. 142 Clayton Road currently has an original hipped roof. As such, the proposed gable roof extension would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings. However, gable roof extensions are not uncommon along Clayton Road, and officers therefore consider that this element of the proposal would not have a significantly adverse impact on the character of the area. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension to the rear. Whilst this element would not entirely meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, it would be modest in scale and would not dominate the rear roofslope. The proposed development would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Southborough Conservation Area and is covered by an area Tree Protection order (TPO). The site is also adjacent to and opposite locally listed buildings of townscape merit.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing rear extension and erection of single-storey rear, front porch extension and first floor extension above the existing garage. Erection of 3 nos rear dormer roof extension, installation of 3 nos front, 2 nos side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rConsultation\r31 Neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating;\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - Objection - The windows at the rear elevation of the property are not in keeping either with the windows at the front elevation or the wider Conservation Area. Our concerns relate primarily to the 1st floor rear windows which could be visible from outside the property and the breach of the existing eaves line with the large window in the centre of the rear elevation\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on the Southborough Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on TPO's\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: It has not been demonstrated that the proposed type and colour of materials (primarily Anthracite grey aluminium framed windows) would complement the character of the original or neighbouring dwellings and would be of a high quality given the location of the site within the Southborough Conservation Area.  It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above, it is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals. Officers consider that this adverse impact would amount to less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. It is therefore necessary to weigh this harm against any public benefits of the proposal. \r\rThe applicant has not advanced any arguments as to the public benefits of the proposal, nor is it apparent to Officers that there would be any. The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified less than substantial harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2021).\r\rTrees\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer Comment: Although there is no loss of trees proposed, officers note the proposed rear development would be in close proximity to the roots of a tree covered by an area TPO and the applicant has not submitted an arboricultural assessment or a tree protection plan to support the application. Therefore, it is considered that the applicant has not demonstrated through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not result in harm to the health and longevity of a tree covered by a tree protection order through damage to its root protection area.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side/rear extension would not strictly adhere to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, 2013 in terms of depth and set back from the front elevation, given that the extension would sit in a spacious plot and be separated from the shared boundaries, officers consider that it would appear as an appropriate addition to the host property and would be in keeping with the character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed front porch extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the demolition of the existing detached garage, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to the internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013 and could not accommodate a modern vehicle officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street parking. The remaining hardstanding to the front of the property could accommodate 1 car parking space which would accord with the maximum standards set out in the London Plan 2021.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to to provide a new pergola to rear of property, relocation of 1 side door and 2no. rooflights, 3no. new rooflights and  hip to gable to rear. In this case officers consider that an assessment would have to be made to ensure that the proposed changes would not give rise to any adverse impacts with regards to character and appearance and neighbouring residential amenity. As such, the proposed changes are considered not to be non-material.",
