    "By virtue of its design, siting and scale, the proposed two storey side extension would result in a terracing effect, and would fail to appear as a subservient addition to the detriment of the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The flat roof form on the proposed first floor rear extension would not respect the character of the host dwelling, and would appear as an incongruous feature that would be at odds with the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 34 and 36  of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The applicant is advised that the existing conservatory does not meet the criteria as laid out in Class A of Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). As such, the conservatory is currently unauthorised and will require planning permission.",
    "Please submit a copy of an Ordnance Survey based site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red and adjoining land owned by applicant in blue, showing at least two road frontages and a North point.\r\rThe proposal is for drop kerb, therefore please revise the location plan to show the red outline in the proposed site including the front pavement, where drop kerb will be proposed"
