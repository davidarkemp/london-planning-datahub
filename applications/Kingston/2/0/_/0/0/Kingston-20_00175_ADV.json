    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the first floor side extension would propose a flat roof form and would not be set back from the front elevation, given that that the roof form would be consistent with existing roof form, and that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate surrounding area, officers consider that the proposed development would not appear out of keeping with the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would not conform to the recommendations set by the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, however, the height would be modest and the roof form would be in keeping with the original dwelling. As such, officers consider that that the proposed development would appear an appropriate addition to the host property. Further, officers note that the form and siting of the proposed development would be consistent with the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate vicinity, and as such the proposed development would not appear out of keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed alterations to the front fenestration would appear consistent with features of the original dwelling, and as such would not appear out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling or surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed first floor side extension in relation to neighbouring properties, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe proposed rear extension would replace an existing outbuilding of a similar footprint and would have a modest height, therefore, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rOfficers note that an opening is proposed to the side elevation of the single storey rear extension. As it would sit hard against the shared boundary, officers consider that a condition should be imposed to ensure that the opening is obscure glazed and non opening at 1.7m above FFL to protect neighbouring residential amenity. Subject to the satisafaction of this condition and given the above, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would convert the existing garage into habitable space. However, as the existing garage would not conform to modern day internal standards as set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposed development would not result in the loss of off-street car parking. In any case, the existing hardstanding to the front of the property would provide 2 of-street on-site parking spaces.  Whilst this level of provision would exceed London Plan maximum standards, Officers consider that it would be unreasonable to refuse permission in this regard.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking and while it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, officers consider that the provision of cycle parking could be addressed via condition in the event of an approval.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012; \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012; and,\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises four units located at the northern end of Barwell Business Park.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks to vary condition 1 (the approved plans) of planning permission reference 19/02315/FUL to allow for alterations to the elevations (addition of condensers and louvres, alteration to existing flues).\r\rConsultation\r3 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health - No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The principle of development;\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established. \r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the granting of the original permission.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe most significant visual change would be the proposed reduction to the height of the flues atop the roof of the building. As approved, these would rise to approximately 9m above the height of the roof; the current proposal would see this reduced to just 1.5m. The proposal would also involve the removal of an antenna attached to the east elevation (which would also have projected above the height of the roof).\r\rThe remaining alterations would be at a lower level and therefore would not be so readily visible from surrounding areas. In any event, the louvres and condensers proposed would appear typical given the use of the building and its location. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe nearest residential properties to the site are located approximately 60m to the north-west on Leatherhead Road. Given this distance, as well as the intervening soft landscaping and the long-established industrial use of the site, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would not have any material adverse impacts on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. This view is strengthened by the fact that the Council's Environmental Health Officer has reviewed the proposal and raises no objections.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The original conclusions reached in respect of all other issues remain unaltered from 19/02315/FUL.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
