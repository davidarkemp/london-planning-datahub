    "The proposed development, by reason of the flat roof form of the two storey rear extension, would create a visually unattractive and incongruous feature when viewed from surrounding properties, resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the immediate surrounding area. The development would therefore be contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring residential amenity. By reason of its scale and siting it would appear overbearing when viewed from 6 Canbury Avenue and would unacceptably reduce the amount of daylight enjoyed by this property, resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants. The development would therefore be contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
