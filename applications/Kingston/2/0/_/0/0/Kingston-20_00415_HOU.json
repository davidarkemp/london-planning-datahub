    "Application Site\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, detached dwellinghouse on the western side of Traps Lane, at the junction with Langley Grove.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character comprising of mainly two-storey detached dwellings. \r\rThe site does not contain a Listed Building and the site is not located within a Conservation Area. The site is located in Flood Zone 1.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of part single-storey side and part two-storey rear extensions. Installation of new front facing fence and formation of dropped kerb vehicular access.\r\rPlanning History\r17/15196/LDP - Erection of single storey rear extension.

Refused planning permission on May 2021.\r21/00283/HOU - Erection of two storey side and part two storey rear extension. Refused planning permission on April 2021.\r\rConsultation\r10no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations received.\r\rHighways Officer - No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- Impact upon the Character and Appearance of the Site and Surrounding Area; \r- Impact on Neighbouring Amenity; and\r- Highways and Transportation\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rCouncil' Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for single-storey rear extensions (under Policy Guidance 33), as follows:\r\rSingle storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases the following guidance will apply: \r\rDepth: \r-\tIf the neighbouring house is set at a lower level the depth of the extension should be reduced.\r-\tIf the neighbouring property has a different rear building line then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r-\tIn all cases at least 50% of the rear garden should remain. (Rear extensions to houses with very small gardens will be assessed on their individual merits.) \r-\tExtensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth.\r\rHeight: \rExtensions proposed with: \r-\ta flat roof should not exceed 3m in height; \r-\ta parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height; \r-\ta pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height; \r-\tand, a balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\r\rCouncil's Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for single-storey side extensions (under Policy Guidance 35), as follows:\r-\tThe roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form, and the height of the roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the second storey.\r-\tThe extension should remain proportionate and subordinate to the original house, so that in general, the width of the extension does not exceed 50% of that of the original house. \r-\tThe extension should be set in from the boundary by at least 250mm so guttering does not overhang adjoining land. \r-\tSide extensions should normally be set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm. \r-\tCare should be taken to ensure that there is no significant loss of daylight or sunlight to neighbouring properties or gardens in accordance with the 45 and 25 degree rules described above. \r-\tFeatures such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house. \r-\tWhere waste bins or cycles are stored to the rear of the house, direct access to the rear garden should be maintained. \r-\tSide extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on plot. \r-\tSide extensions to semi-detached dwellings should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property\r\rThe proposals seek permission for a single-storey side extension. The side extension would measure approximately 4.5m in width and extend the full length of the dwelling and project 3m from the existing rear building elevation to form a rear extension. \r\rIn design terms the extension would complement the host dwelling with an appropriate roof pitch and whilst the side extension would not be set back from the principal building line but would instead sit flush to the front wall, this is considered acceptable to ensure a suitably cohesive appearance in this instance given the overall scale and detached nature of the host dwelling. The rear extension element would similarly comply with local guidance and is considered a subordinate addition. The proposed rear extension would increase the footprint of the property and thereby reduce the amount of private amenity space available for residents to enjoy. However, adequate amenity space would be retained so that the enjoyment of the property is not compromised. \r\rWhilst the proposed boundary treatment would be contemporary in style, officers note that similar boundary treatment can be viewed in the immediate surrounding area, and as such the proposed boundary treatment is considered to be acceptable in terms of design, with no resultant adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers are satisfied that the proposal would not appear overbearing when viewed from neighbouring properties or unduly deprive the occupants of these properties of light. This is due largely to the absence of any immediate neighbours to the north. The proposed fenestration would offer similar views to the existing and officers consider this to be appropriate.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rThe proposed height of the boundary treatment would be 1.5m in height, and include part brick wall/part horizontal wooden fencing above and section of slatted timber vehicular entrance gates and separate pedestrian gate. The new vehicular access proposed off Traps Lane would necessitate a dropped kerb which has been explicitly shown on plans. \r\rFollowing review from RBK Highways Officers, they have not raised any concerns regarding visibility and highway safety from the boundary treatment. Highways officers are also satisfied in terms of the highway safety of the proposed crossover and access off Traps Lane. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of highway safety and as such would accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and on the wider area and would not result in a materially harmful impact to the amenities of adjoining neighbouring dwellinghouses in terms of overshadowing, loss of light and visual dominance or sense of overbearing. The proposals have also been assessed as acceptable in terms of highways safety.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate otherwise, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. \r\rYour attention is also drawn to the fact that this permissio does not grant any rights to use Council owned land for any purposes. \r\rIf you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rThis application is a revision of 20/02743/HOU, which was refused because of the impact it would have had on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rThe key difference in this application is a reduction in size of the two storey side extension from 4m to 3.7m width, and the roof of the extension would be set lower than the main roof.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Residential Design SPD requires that two storey side extensions should appear as subordinate and proportionate additions to the host property. To that end, they should be set down from the main ridge of the dwelling by at least 500mm. In the case of properties with a cat-slide roof form, they should also be set back from the front wall of the property by at least 1m in order to retain this feature.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would be sufficiently set back from the front wall at first floor level, but would not be at ground floor level and the existing cat-slide roof would still be lost. The extension would therefore fail to appear subordinate and would result in the application property having a wholly different appearance to its adjoining semi-detached neighbour. It would significantly alter the massing of the building, such that it would appear lopsided and unbalanced.\r\rOfficers note that many of the properties on the road have been extended to varying degrees but many of these retain (even if it is only as a somewhat symbolic gesture) their original cat-slide roofs. The pair of semi-detached properties opposite the site do not appear to have been altered whatsoever.\r\rHaving regard to these considerations, officers consider that the proposed two storey extension would dominate and unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties of which the application property forms a part and that the development is unacceptable in terms of its excessive scale and siting. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\r\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
