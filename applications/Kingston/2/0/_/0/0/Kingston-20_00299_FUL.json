    "The proposed side dormer extension by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and would be visually intrusive in the streetscene, to the detriment of the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and the streetscene. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM 1 0 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Schedule 2, Part 1, Class C (b) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) states that any other alteration to the roof of a dwellinghouse is not permitted if the alteration would protrude more than 0.15 metres beyond the plane of the slope of the original roof when measured from the perpendicular with the external surface of the original roof.",
