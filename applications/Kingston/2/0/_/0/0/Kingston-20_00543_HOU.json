    "The proposed hip to gable roof conversion and gable roof form on the two storey side extension would unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at Nos. 10 and 12 Forest Side, Worcester Park KT4 7PB. The roof forms on the proposed development would add significant bulk above the eaves height of the host dwelling, and would appear incongruous with the immediate setting of the site. The proposal would therefore fail to comply with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM 10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 36 and paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
