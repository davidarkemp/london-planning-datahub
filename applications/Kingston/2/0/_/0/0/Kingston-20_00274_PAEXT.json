    "The proposed extension would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been received from 1 property relating to: \r\r- Effects on trees;\r- Inappropriate design/layout;\r- Loss of light/sunlight; and,\r- Access. \r\rConcerns relating to boundaries and property rights are a civil matter and are not material planning considerations which can be assessed as part of this application. Otherwise the concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and are detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey front porch extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set by the Residential Design SPD, it would be modest in scale and have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling, and as such it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original building or surrounding area.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed single storey side extension would not be set in from the shared boundary, however, it would have a modest eaves height and would continue the roof form of the proposed front porch extension, and as such would be considered an appropriate extension to the host property. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear would not adhere to the recommendations set by the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth (4m v 3.5-3m), however, given the modest height it would appear a subordinate addition to the host property.\r\rOfficers have no evidence to suggest any trees on site would be adversely affected by the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that while the proposed development would sit hard against the shared boundaries, given the separation distance between the proposed development and the flank wall of No. 10 Cedarcroft Road, as well as the modest eaves height of the proposed development and siting of windows and openings, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 10 Cedarcroft Road by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rSimilarly, in terms of No. 6 Cedarcroft Road, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of its occupants by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy due to the modest eaves height, siting of windows and openings and limited projection beyond the neighbouring rear elevation.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. As the access to the rear of the property would be severed due to the proposed development, and it is not clear from the plans where cycle parking would be accommodated on site, officers consider that this issue could be addressed via condition and would not warrant a reason for refusal.\r\rTherefore,  subject tot he satisfaction of a cycle parking condition the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
