    "The erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front roof lights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to reduce the width of the single storey side/rear extension, replace the proposed timber cladding with blockwork on the single storey side/rear extension, and install a boiler pipe and soil vent pipe to the side elevation of the dwelling. \r\rWhilst the changes to the proposed footprint are likely to be Non-material, clear plans should be provided in a fresh application that focus on the proposed changes only. Moreover, further information on the Boiler Flue and SVP are required.",
