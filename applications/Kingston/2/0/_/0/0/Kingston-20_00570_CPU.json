    "The demolition of existing conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The application site comprises of a proposed restaurant, which is part of a parade of shops on the western side of Eden Street, Kingston Upon Thames. \rThere are four existing condensers on the first floor flat roof at the rear of the building. The proposal is for the replacement of these condensers with new models. Two condensers will serve the AC system for the customer area and the back-of-house/kitchen area. Two other condensers will serve a new fridge and freezer. A new kitchen ventilation system is also proposed, including one supply fan and one extract fan. There are a number of properties nearby, which have existing plant. Specialist noise consultants have been instructed to prepare a Noise Impact\r1 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received by the Council.\rRBK Environmental Health -\rThe Environmental Health Officer is satisfied that the revised acoustic report demonstrates mitigation measures that will achieve compliance with the Council's plant noise condition. In order to provide a robust enforcement capacity going forward, the following condition, which cannot be discharged, is recommended:-\r\"The rating level of the noise determined by the cumulative sound emissions of the plant hereby permitted, shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation.  The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade.  Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is for the replacement of four existing condensers on the first floor flat roof at the rear of the building. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rOfficer Comment: Given the proposal is for the replacement of four existing condensers on the first floor flat roof at the rear of the building, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. As demonstrated by the revised acoustic report provided in support of the application, officers consider that the proposal would not give rise to increased unacceptable noise or disturbance for occupants of neighbouring properties, particularly as a prescriptive condition in this regard, is recommended. Finally as the proposal is for air conditioning units, officers consider that the proposal would not give rise to unacceptable levels of fumes for occupants of neighbouring properties.\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r"
