    "----Officer Report ----\r\rThe application site is located on the south side of Jubilee Way.\r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in use. The site is located adjavcent the Metrpolitan Open Land of Tolworth Court Farm and King George Playing Fields.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of 20 metre high slimline monopole supporting 6no. antennas, the installation of 2no. equipment cabinets along with associated ancillary development thereto.\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are:\r\r- Siting and;\r- Appearance\r\rThe application is located on the pavement in a prominant location on the south side of Jubilee Way near to the Industrial estate to the west and adjacent to designated Metropolitan Open Lands of Tolworth Court Farm and King George Playing Fields.\r\rThe proposed mast would be 20m in height which would be in excess of 10 to 12m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical of other such predominant perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality and it is considered that the siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location by virtue of its siting and appearance which would result in an incongruous addition to the streetscene that would be visually intrusive and create visual clutter and would not be in keeping with and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the setting of the adjacent Metropolitan Open Lands of Toworth Court Farm and King George Playing Fields and be in conflict with policies CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits.\r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal \rFormation of dropped kerb. \r\rConsultations\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineer - No objection \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the proposal on the highway\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that numerous properties on Chantry Road benefit from dropped kerb access and hardstandings to the front of their properties, it is considered that the proposal would be in-keeping within the immediate context of the site. As a result, the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the street scene or the surrounding area, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy.\r\rIt is noted that the hardstanding has been installed. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to its minor nature, it is considered that the proposals would not cause undue harm to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore be compliant with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy.\r\rHighways\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF is clear that: Development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rLocal Policy DM10 requires new developments to have regard to highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rIt is noted that the Council's Neighbourhood Engineer raised no objections to the scheme. \r\rThe proposed new dropped kerb would be sited on a befitting location and would be easily visible by the highway users of Chantry Road. As such, it is considered that the proposal would not undermine the existing highway safety conditions of Chantry Road. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8, DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

    "Application Site\rThe application site is located on the northern side of Warren Drive North at the junction with Beresford Avenue. \rThe building is not statutory or locally listed and is not located within a conservation area.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the installation of 1no. side roof light and addition of 1no. side window at first floor level.\r\rConsultation\r7no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; and \r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals involve the installation of 1no. rooflights to the side roofslope, together with the addition of 1no. window to the first floor side elevation. The proposed rooflight would be an aluminium Velux window flush to the roof. The window to the first floow side elevation is labelled on the submitted plans as obscure-glazed, and officers apply a condition to this effect.\r\rThe proposed changes are considered acceptable in terms of their design and would result in minimal impact on the character and appearance of the host dwellinghouse and wider streetscene.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",

The revised proposed first floor side extension would have a total depth of 4.5m, it would main the existing gap between neighbouring property No. 55 Northcote Road and would not extend past the two storey rear extension of neighbouring property No.59 Northcote Road. \rWhilst it is noted that the proposed eternit cedral waterboarding would not have similarity to the host dwelling walls, officers note that the proposed development would generally be designed to respect the character of the original dwelling with the proposed pitched roof, as such would appear as a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. \rOfficers consider that on balance there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above, the proposed first floor side extension would have a total depth of 4.5m, it would main the existing gap between neighbouring property No. 55 Northcote Road and would not extend past the two storey rear extension of neighbouring property No.59 Northcote Road.
