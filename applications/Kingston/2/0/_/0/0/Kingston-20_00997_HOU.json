    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall be occupied solely for purposes incidental to the occupation and enjoyment of the application property as a single dwelling and shall not be used as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings.",

    "The applicant is reminded that implementing this development in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful. This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. \r\rThe applicant is advised that the works related to application 21/02977/CEU must be substantially complete prior to the commencement of works approved as part of this permission.",
