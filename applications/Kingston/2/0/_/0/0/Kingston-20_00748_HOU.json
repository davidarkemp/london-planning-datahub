    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development  hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the side (west) wall of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements  for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy  Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a building (Use Class E).\r\rThe application seeks to install internally illuminated fascia sign and projecting signs.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the proposal on neighbouring residential amenity; and,\r- The impact of the proposal on highway safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered appropriate for a commercial premises and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  A condition to restrict the hours which the fascia signs can be illuminated and a condition to limit the illumination level of the signs is proposed. Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion, on street car parking pressure, or compromise pedestrian or highway safety. \r  \rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposals would not be significantly different from the existing situation and would therefore have no adverse impact upon highways and transportation, thereby complying with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a commercial unit located on the ground floor of a semi-detached property. The site is located within St John's Locally Significant Industrial Site.\r\r135 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - No objection subject to conditions\r \rPublic Health Nutritionist - The site would be within 300m of Kings Oak Primary School and within close proximity of 5 existing hot food takeaway restaurants. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The principle of the development; \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage.\r\rPrincipal of Development\rOfficers note that whilst the site falls within St John's Locally Significant Industrial Site, the property currently operates as a retail shop following planning app ref: 12/14032/FUL. Further, while the proposal sits within an Industrial area, officers note that Kingston Road Local Centre lies directly opposite the application site, and as such in relation to surrounding uses along Kingston Road, the proposed change of use in this case would not be incompatible or dissimilar to the existing. \r\rHowever, officers also note that the proposed fast food takeaway would sit within 400m walking distance from the entrance of Kings Oak Primary School and therefore the proposal would not be compliant with the objectives of Policy DM21 of the Core Strategy.\r\rDesign\rThe proposed external changes would involve the installation of an extraction flue to the side elevation of the property. While it would be viewed from the streetscene, officers note that it would not extend higher than the ridge of the original roofslope, and would be set back from the front elevation, and as such officers consider the impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area to be minimal. The proposal would also alter the signage on the shopfront, but no other changes are proposed to the front elevation of the property. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rThe proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHowever, Officers are not convinced that the proposed odour control measures would be in compliance with current guidance, especially taking into consideration the neighbouring dwellings that will overlook the extraction system when the former Homebase site development has been completed. As such, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that there will be a high level of odour control implemented within the scheme, in the event of approval. \r\rFurther, officers note that insufficient detail has been provided regarding noise control, and as such officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that an acoustic report is submitted prior to use, to ensure that there is no adverse effect for neighbouring properties in regards to an increase in noise, in the event of approval.\r\rAs such, it is considered that in the event of an approval and subject to a condition to control odour, noise and the hours of operation, the proposed development would not result in undue noise or disturbance.\r\rHighways and Transportation\rWhile the application site has a PTAL Score of 2 (low), officers consider that the change of use would not result in a significant intensification of activities on site and or trip generation. Despite the lack of parking provision associated with the site, there would be sufficient opportunities for short stay parking (commensurate with the size and type of proposed use) on surrounding roads in close proximity of the site.  Therefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon on-street car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety over and above the existing use, thereby achieving compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10. \r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rConclusion\rThe scheme under consideration involves the change of use to Hot Food Take-Away - Sui Generis Use Class from Retail unit - E(a) Use Class and the installation of an extractor flue pipe.\r\rThe proposed development would have no adverse impacts on employment land and premises.  Neither would it have an unacceptable adverse impact upon character and appearance and or highways and transportation. These are all neutral matters.\r\rHowever, given that the application site would fall within 400m walking distance from an entrance of a primary school, officers consider that the proposal would fail to accord with policy E9 of the Lonodn Plan and policy DM21 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. Officers consider that this issue would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of granting permission, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF 2021 taken as a whole. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.",
    "A proposal was recently refused for an outbuilding ( 21/00402/CPU dated 07.04.2021) due to its height in relation to the boundary. During construction the height of the outbuilding has been reduced to comply with the legislation and the proposed bathroom has been removed.\r",
    "Please confirm the description 'Demolition of existing garage and erection of three storey side and single storey rear extension, installation of 1 no rear rooflight in main roof.'",
    "Please submit a copy of site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red and adjoining land owned by applicant in blue, showing at least two road frontages and a North point.\r\rNote: Please note that the quality of advice will be proportionate to the level of information provided, therefore it is to the applicants benefit to provide as much supporting information as possible for the proposal such as plans, elevations, photographs and supporting documents."
