    "Reject non-material amendments - the amendments proposed are greater than non-material.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections have been received from 2 separate households relating to:\r\r- Effects on trees;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings;\r- Inappropriate design/layout;\r- Loss of light/sunlight;\r- Noise; and,\r- Privacy.\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the first floor side extension would not adhere to the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, as it would not be set back from the front elevation, or set down from the ridge of the original roof slope, and as such would not appear as a subordinate addition to the host property. \r\rThe proposed hip-to-gable roof extension would also not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, as it would significantly unbalance the roofscape of the pair of semi-detached properties the application site forms part of. Ultimately, the combination of the hip-to-gable roof extension with the first floor side extension would create a bulky and excessive addition to the host property, and given that no similar extensions are viewed in the immediate streetscene, officers consider it would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would also not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, as it would not be appropriately set down from the ridge or in from the side of the roof slope and as such would add to the bulk and excessive nature of the proposed development.\r\rWhile the proposed single storey rear extension would also not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth and height, officers consider it wouldn't appear out of scale with the host property. Further as similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rOfficers note that a comment was received regarding the impact of the proposed development on surrounding trees, however, given that there are no protected trees within or surrounding the application site, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely impact on protected trees. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the single storey rear extension would not extend further in depth than what is existing, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rWhile the first floor side extension and roof extensions would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the habitable windows of neighbouring properties officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rOfficers note that an opening is proposed on the side elevation at first floor level, however, to mitigate against any loss of privacy to neighbouring properties, officers consider that a condition could be imposed if planning permission were to be granted to ensure that it was finished in obscure glazing and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels. In this case, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers note that a comment was received relating to possible noise generated by the proposed development. However, given that the proposed development would be for a residential extension within a residential area, officers consider that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact with regards to noise disturbance and neighbouring amenity would not be unduly compromised. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would convert the existing garage into habitable space, officers note that the internal dimensions of the existing garage does not comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any loss of off-street parking on site. In any case the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would accommodate on-site provision (1 space) which would accord with London Plan standards.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion and by reason of its scale, mass and design, the proposed first floor side extension, rear dormer roof extension and hip-to-gable roof extension would appear excessive, dominant and would not relate well to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
