    "PREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY:\rApplication reference 20/01700/FUL - Erection of a two storey detached house and detached linked two storey annex with single storey detached garage (following demolition of existing house, garage, surrounding terraces and annex building). Granted planning permission, dated 06.11.2020.\r\rApplication reference 21/03092/CLC - Details required for Conditions 13 (Landscaping Scheme) 14 (Refuse and Recycling) and 15 (Cycle Storage) of planning permission 20/01700/FUL (Erection of a two storey detached house and detached linked two storey annex with single storey detached garage (following demolition of existing house, garage, surrounding terraces and annex building)). Application refused, dated 19 November 2021. \r\rCONSULTATIONS:\r17no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. 1no. comment has been received which was neutral in content and is summarised as below:\r-  Emphasises the need to protect trees and hedgerows\r\rOfficer comments: The Arboricultural Report dated October 2020 is to remain unchanged and, as such, officers consider that the assessment made in respect of impacts upon, and protection of, trees / landscaping remain valid and adequate.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS\rThe application site is a substantial detached house on the western side of Warren Park. \r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character. \r\rThe site is not statutory listed or locally listed. However, it falls within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and lies immediately adjacent to Coombe House Conservation Area. \r\rPROPOSAL\rCondition 1 (Approved Plans) and Condition 5 (Fenestration) of Planning Permission ref: 20/01700/FUL (Erection of a two storey detached house and detached linked two storey annex with single storey detached garage (following demolition of existing house, garage, surrounding terraces and annex building) dated 06/11/2020. \r\rVariation to include alterations to layout and footprint at ground floor level, lowering eaves line and changes to elevations (Condition 1) and alter the wording of Condition 5 removing the words referring to the study from the condition.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe variations to the approved plans include:\r- Removal of single storey side extension (Gym, 21.6sqm) and rear terrace and displace this between the dining and games room, now 21.1sqm;\r- Lowering of rear floor and terrace levels;\r- Displace the proposed garage west by 300mm;\r- Reposition the proposed two storey element, consisting of games-room on ground floor and bed 4 and study on first floor, 300mm to the east and align with the dominant house form;\r- Removal of rear balcony from bed 4;\r- Alterations to the size of windows and door openings, including reducing the size of openings, enlarging the north facing study/bed 6 and stairwell windows, removing utility windows and removal of frameless corner windows;\r- Removal of first floor west facing window from bed 6/study;\r- Addition of roof light to upmost flat roof (bed 2 en-suite); and,\r- Removal of metal cladding from the exterior.\r\rThe main issues to consider when assessing this application relate to the principle of development, the resulting impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area, the impact of the development on heritage assets and the impact of the development on amenities of neighbouring residents. \r\rPrinciple of Development\rThis application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established.\r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the grant of the original permission.\r\rImpact upon Character and Appearance of the Area\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposals would result in a minor change to the floor area (0.5sqm) by compacting the overall footprint. The overall volume would remain similar to that as approved. The alterations proposed would not result in a development which increases in scale or bulk as the development would continue to be constructed closely within the originally approved building envelope. \r\rThe proposed overall height would remain the same as that approved. Officers note however that the proposal would now appear slightly decreased in scale as a result of the lowering of the eaves. \r\rThe proposed garage would remain the same size to that which has been approved, but the proposals would see this building be repositioned slightly to align with the other proposed changes to the main dwellinghouse.\r\rThe adjustment of the two-storey element to the west of the dwelling would be relatively minor and is considered not to result in any detrimental impact to the overall design of the dwelling.\r\rThe adjustments proposed to the fenestration are considered appropriate. \r\rWith the western extension omitted and repositioned centrally between the two main building forms, two modest sized windows are shown to be introduced at ground floor level. One of the two first floor windows (i.e. serving a study) has been omitted and the remaining window would be reduced in size. As a result of this change, Condition 5 of the original planning permission is sought to be reworded to omit reference to the study. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and area.\r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset) and lies immediately adjacent to, but outside of, the boundaries of the Coombe House Conservation Area. The surrounding character of the area is residential with relatively large, detached dwellinghouses within individual plots. Nearby dwellinghouses are a mix of contemporary mansion-style homes and properties built in the Arts and Crafts style. The estate retains its original mature landscaping.\r\rAs noted above, officers consider that the proposed amendments would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. Likewise officers consider that the proposed development would not affect the setting of the adjacent conservation area or the non-designated heritage asset of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character or otherwise harm either assets' significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal.\r\rResidential Amenity\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rConclusion/Planning Balance\rUnder the provisions of s.73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the proposed amendments to Condition 1 (Approved Plans) and Condition 5 (Fenestration) of Planning Permission ref: 20/01700/FUL are considered to maintain high design quality appropriate for its setting within a Strategic Area of Special Character and adjacent to a Conservation Area. The proposals are considered to comply with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy D3 and Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012. \r \rRECOMMENDATION\rGrant planning permission.\r",
