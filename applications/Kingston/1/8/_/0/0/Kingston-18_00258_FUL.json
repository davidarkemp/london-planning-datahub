    "Within six months of the date of this Decision Notice, the hoarding, as identified on the submitted plans and documentation, shall be entirely removed from the site. \r\rReason: In the interests of the visual amenity of the area and in order to preserve the special character of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM12 of the council's LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, adjoining Metropolitan Open Land to the rear. \r\rThe current application relates to previous planning permission ref no 19/02014/HOU (Erection of a part two storey, part single storey side extension and single storey rear extension. Erection of front porch, rear dormer extension with Juliet balcony and front dormer extension with two roof lights to facilitate loft conversion) and the enforcement case ref no EN/15604. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on Metropolitan Open Land (the site address borders with MOL).\r\r5 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. Three letters have been received raising the following summarised concerns:\ro\tExcessive height or bulk of the outbuilding;\ro\tLoss of privacy as a result of the balcony use; and,\ro\tUnacceptable or incompatible use.\r\rOfficer response:\rThe above concerns will be addressed in the following assessment.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The balcony in relation to the rear dormer comprises a small platform measuring 0.9m deep and a surrounding glass balustrade that would allow standing access. Given the proposed design, siting and modest scale of the balcony (not spacious enough to accommodate a sitting area) and the fact that it would not be visible from the street, the balcony is considered not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the property or the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed development also includes a new roof design over the single storey rear extension which would be flat and approx. 3m high (the approved, part flat part pitched roof, roof measured approx. 3.3m), which is considered to be of an acceptable design and would be in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe existing outbuilding is situated at the back of the rear garden and is approx. 3m high, 9m wide and 2.8m deep, featuring a small and centrally located clock tower on the roof (non-illuminated and soundless). Officers acknowledge that the proposed height of the outbuilding exceeds what is afforded through permitted development rights, however, given the siting of the outbuilding, its modest depth, the presence of existing outbuildings at adjoining properties and the existing boundary treatment, it is considered that the outbuilding would not conflict with the prevailing form and pattern of development and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the existing street scene, the surrounding area or Metropolitan Open Land. \r\rOverall and on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the host property or the surrounding area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the erection of the balcony raised neighbours' concerns regarding potential overlooking and loss of privacy. However, given that the base of the balcony measures only approx. 0.9 in depth, it would not be large enough to accommodate a sitting area or the opportunity to dwell for extended periods of time. Whilst the balcony would allow views into neighbouring rear gardens these views would be similar to those achieved from existing windows in the rear elevation of the application property and would not facilitate direct views into neighbouring habitable room windows.  Due to the siting and scale of the balcony it is considered not to be overbearing. \r\rThe outbuilding situated in the rear garden, given its siting, modest depth and the existing outbuildings at the adjoining properties would not result in loss of daylight/sunlight, loss of privacy or create an overbearing effect (the eaves height is approx. 2.4m). \r\rThe new flat roof (approx. 3m high) over the single storey rear extension would not result in an unacceptable impact on the amenities of the adjoining occupiers. \r\rGiven the above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIt is noted that the application site borders Metropolitan Open Land to the rear. Due to the scale and siting of the proposed development, the existing boundary treatment comprising tall, mature trees and existing outbuildings in the rear gardens of neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not have any greater impact upon the openness of the MOL than the existing situation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016), the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
