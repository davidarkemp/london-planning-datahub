    "The proposed development would meet the criteria of Classes B and C of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would be lawful.",
    "The council's Environmental health Officer, the Environment Agent and Network Rail have been consulted and do not raise any objections. The council's neighbourhood Traffic Engineer have lifted their objection following removal of the proposed crossover.  \r\r15 neighbouring properties have been consulted and I contribution has been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposed development upon highways and transportation; \r- Flooding impacts; and\r- Impact on trees \r\r\rPolicies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 require that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. Architecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 requires that buildings and structures do not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of surrounding land and buildings, particularly residential buildings, in relation to privacy, overshadowing, wind and microclimate.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 requires proposals to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side extension and detached dwelling would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 act together to ensure that new development reflects the standards in the Government's Nationally Described Space Standard 2015. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires that each new dwelling has a minimum of 50m2 of private garden (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed new dwelling would be dual aspect and meet the minimum space standards and the amenity space would exceed the minimum requirements. Overall the proposed new dwelling would provide a good standard of accommodation. \r\rParagraph 109 of the NPPF states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. Policy 6.3 of the London Plan 2016 requires that the impacts of proposed development on transport capacity and the transport network are fully assessed. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rPolicy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016 states that the Mayor of London wishes to see an appropriate balance being struck between promoting new development and preventing excessive car parking provision that can undermine cycling, walking and public transport use. To this end, Table 6.2 of the Parking Addendum to the London Plan 2016 sets out maximum car parking standards which should be the basis for considering planning applications.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application initially proposed a new crossover to serve the new dwelling, however, following concerns raised by the Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer, this has been removed. As such the new dwelling proposes no off street parking. The site is not located within a controlled parking zone. The PTAL score is 1b (poor) and therefore off street parking would be desirable, however, that would not be possible to provide in this case and it is not considered that the additional cars associated with the proposal would place undue pressure on existing on street parking and as such the proposal would comply with Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019, Policy 6.3 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy. \r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Assessment that accompanies the application proposes  appropriate mitigation (resilience) measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
