These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from the landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "The building/extension that you propose may affect a right of light enjoyed by the neighbouring property. This is a private right which can be acquired by prescriptive uses over 20 years; as such it is not affected in any way by the grant of planning permission.",

The applicant (or any subsequent owner or developer) is therefore reminded that the onus of responsibility to ensure the proposed cladding installation meets current fire safety regulations lies fully with them and that they are legally obliged to apply for the relevant Building Regulations.\r",
    "During construction, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway.  The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads.  We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris.  This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.",

The applicant should be aware that any such parking will cause unnecessary concern and agitation within the local community; Should make full use of the site accesses to maximise the availability of off street parking",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.",
