    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision. \r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990. (As amended).\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed amendments are as follows: \r\r- Insertion of an additional roof light within the front roof slope;\r- Replacement of the juliette balcony in the rear dormer with a window;\r- Replacement of the roof lantern in the rear extension with a flat roof light; and\r- Removal of the window in the rear extension in favour of an enlarged set of bi-fold doors.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that these amendments would not have any material impact on either the character and appearance of the area or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. The proposal is considered to be in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe proposal seeks the replacement of the pitched roof atop the existing single storey rear extension with a flat roof, together with alterations to the fenestration in the front, rear and flank elevations.\r\r25 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rKingston Town CAAC - No response received\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed flat roof would not be in keeping with the original design of the property or the adjoining semi-detached neighbour. However, the extension it would sit atop is very small in scale and does not appear to be original. In any case, it would not be readily visible from the public highway and would therefore have a very limited impact on the character and appearance of the area. The alterations to the fenestration in the rear and side elevations would have a limited impact upon the character and appearance of the area for the same reason. \r\rThe alterations to the front elevation would see the existing windows restored to their original size. Currently they are noticeably smaller, which disrupts the symmetry with the adjoining semi-detached property. The existing windows also lack a central mullion and the proposal would see this restored. While the proposed windows would be of a uPVC construction, officers note that the existing windows are constructed of the same material and overall, officers consider that the changes to the size and design of the windows would have a positive impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
