    "The proposal would require planning permission.",
    "Consultations\r9no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension with increased roof height on existing extension.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site comprises of a two-storey, semi-detached property. \r\rThe surrounding properties comprises predominantly semi-detached two-storey dwellinghouses.\rThe application site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tCharacter and Appearance; \r-\tThe Impact upon Residential Amenity; and\r-\tFire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would not be visible from the streetscene, contained behind the existing built form. \r\rThe proposals involve the erection of a 3.6m deep infill rear extension. The extension would have a flat roof with the form and height matching the existing rear extension which is proposed as part of this application to be a height to correspond. \rThe proposed extension is considered minor in its scale and appropriate in its design, in keeping with the rear elevation of the host building. \r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider that there would be no material impact from the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed rear single-storey extension would cause no significant increase in the loss of privacy, loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties, projecting no further in depth than the rear built line of the adjoining semi-detached dwelling (at No. 111) and only very slightly beyond the rear elevation at No. 115.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the relevant policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe proposal by virtue of its scale, design and materiality is considered to be subservient to the host dwelling and would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or wider area. In addition, the proposals would not result in materially harmful impact to neighbouring amenity by way of overlooking, loss of light or sense of overbearing or enclosure. \r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "The redoutline in the location plan is only in the main block, the red outline needs to include the access fron the main road/highway. Please submit a Site Location Plan at a scale of either 1:1250  which identifies the site and the surrounding area and shows at least two roads and the north point. The site should be outlined in red. It should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development (e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway, visibility splays, car parking and open areas around buildings).\r",
    "The submitted block plan is labelled as existing.\rPlease provide a Proposed Block Plan drawn at an identified standard metric scale (such as 1:200 or 1:500) showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site. The Block Plan must show the direction of North and should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
