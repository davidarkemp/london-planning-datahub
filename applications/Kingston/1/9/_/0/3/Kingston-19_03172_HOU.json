    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The outbuilding shall be occupied solely for the purposes ancillary to the occupation and enjoyment of 43 Kingsmead Avenue. It shall not be occupied as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: The outbuilding is of insufficient size to provide a suitable standard of residential accommodation, and would fail to comply with the minimum the space standards set out in Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016), and would be contrary to Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (April 2012), and the Kingston Residential Design SPD (July 2013).",
    "The site comprises a two-storey end terrace located on the eastern side of Rose Walk, which is a well-established residential area. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and\r- Whether the development would increase the risk of flooding in and around the site.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale/form/bulk/height/massing/spacing/design (delete as appropriate). It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy (delete as appropriate).\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 and is located within a Crtitical Drainage Area. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. This could be by an appropriately worded condition if permission were forthcoming.",
