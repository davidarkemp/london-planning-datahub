    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990.  (As amended)\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the northern and southern flank walls of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows in the northern elevation (and situated on the first floor in relation to the bathroom and on the second floor in relation to the bathrooms) shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Cycle parking.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the single storey side extension does not strictly accord with the recommendations as set out by the Residential Design SPD, given the configuration of the site, and that the proposed development would be set back from the front elevation, the proposed development would not appear out of scale with the host property. Further, officers note that similar flat roof single storey side extensions exist within the Barton Green streetscene, and as such the proposed side extension would not appear out of keeping with the immediate surrounding area. The single storey rear element would be modest in scale and as such appear a proportionate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the existing side access from the front to the rear of the property, as well as the store would be lost as a result of the proposed development and consequently the existing means of securely storing bicycles on site. London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include secure provision for cycle parking and while it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, officers consider that this issue could be addressed via condition.\r\rExisting car parking provision would not be affected on site.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application property is a two-storey end-terrace dwelling, with converted loft space, located on the north side of Browns Road. The property has an 'L' shaped footprint and a handed appearance to the adjoining property at no. 2 Browns Road. Beyond the rear elevation of the property, there is a garden depth of approximately 8.9m, with the rear boundary of the property adjoining the side elevation of no. 6 Muybridge Yard. Running parallel to the western side boundary of the property is the access road that serves the residential properties in Muybridge Yard, and on the opposite side of this access are the rear boundaries of properties within Ewell Road. The property is not listed and is located outside, but adjacent to, the Oakhill Conservation Area.\r\r21 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and no responses were received following the consultation period. \r\rThe following consultation was undertaken:\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee - No objection \r\rThere is no planning history relevant to the application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon the character and appearance of the conservation area; and\r- The impact upon residential amenity.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.  \r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness. \r  \rParagraph 193 of NPPF (2019) states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r     \rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) states that development proposals which affect heritage assets should conserve their significance by being sympathetic to the asset's significance and appreciation of their surroundings.                                         \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy (2012) sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of an existing single storey, flat roof extension at the rear of the property. It does not possess significant architectural merit that benefits the host property or the surrounding area and so there is no objection to its loss. The proposal involves the erection of a replacement single storey, flat roof extension in a similar location that also infills the gap between the property and the side boundary with the access to the properties in Muybridge Yard. The proposed extension would be in scale and character with the original property and so there would be no adverse impact in this regard.\r\rImmediately adjacent to the side boundary of the property is the Oakhill Conservation Area. Views across the site towards the conservation area would be seen against the backdrop of the properties in Ewell Road that are commercial at ground floor with residential above. At the rear of some of these properties is extraction equipment associated with the commercial uses, which do not make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. \rGiven the scale and appearance of the extension in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the character and appearance of the conservation area would be preserved as a result of the development. The proposal would therefore accord with policy HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2012) states that new developments should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal would increase the footprint of the property and thereby reduce the amount of private amenity space available for residents to enjoy. The proposed extension would marginally project further rearwards than the existing structure with the majority of the additional floorspace being created by the infilling of the gap up to the side boundary of the property. Approximately 44sqm of private amenity space would be retained, which is below the 50sqm recommended by the Residential Design Guide (2013). Whilst there would be space lost with the infill aspect of the extension, it is not considered that this area provides meaningful amenity space that would be used on a day-to-day basis due to its narrow width. Therefore the amount of meaningful amenity space would be similar to the existing provision, and so the proposal would not compromise the occupants' enjoyment of their private space. \r\rThe proposed extension would have a flat roof finish that could potentially be used as an outdoor seating area/balcony that is accessed from the first floor. Such a use is likely to lead to increased noise disturbance to neighbouring residents as well as an increased perception of overlooking. Therefore a condition can be imposed to prevent any such use of the roof area. On the opposite side of the Muybridge Yard access road is an entrance door and window that serves a property with Ewell Road, though it is not clear whether it provides access to the ground floor or a residential property on the upper floors, or a separate unit of accommodation. At the side of the application property, the proposed extension will have an eaves height of 2.9m and slightly set in from the boundary. This door and window already face onto the side elevation of the two-storey, main body of the dwelling so any outlook would not be further compromised by the addition of the extension. \r\rIt is therefore considered that an acceptable relationship with neighbouring properties would be maintained and so the proposal would accord with policy of the London Plan (2021) and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site is located at the junction with Richmond Road and Albany Park Road and contains a detached bungalow that has been extended by way of single storey and roof extensions. The site is located within Flood Risk Zone 2 (Medium Probability) and has a PTAL score of 1b (Very Poor). The site also lies within a controlled parking zone. Albany Park Road is a residential street with a suburban feel and some characterful detached two storey houses, particularly nearer the Richmond Road end, providing good quality street frontage. Similarly, the houses on Richmond Road, particularly those opposite Fern Hill School and Kingston Academy, are almost exclusively two storey, sharing a similar architectural language to houses on Albany Park Road, comprising traditional materials such as brick, render and tiles. \r\rOne letter of objection has been received. The objection can be summarised as:  excessive height, bulk and footprint; loss of light & privacy. These comments are addressed in the comments below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Highways/transportation; and,\r- Flood risk.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment: The proposal seeks to demolish the existing bungalow and replace it with a three storey 5 bedroom dwellinghouse. A flat-roofed garage/garden room is proposed adjacent to the western boundary. The proposed house would have a dual pitched roof with gable ends to the front and rear. The house would have a render finish to the walls and a zinc roof with what appears to be standing seams. The proposal would introduce roof terraces at first floor level and large areas of glazing on the north elevation. The proposed house would be of a contemporary vernacular. One car parking space would be provided within the garage. \r\rNo contextual analysis has been submitted with the application. It is considered that the design and use of materials makes little or no reference to the architectural style of houses in the surrounding area which seems particularly important in this prominent location. Furthermore, no street scene elevation has been submitted and so it is unclear how the proposed house would relate in terms of scale, mass and more crucially, it's height to the immediate and wider context. The incorporation of roof terraces would appear to be an incongruous feature, not reflective of its surroundings. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not successfully integrate into its surroundings. \r\rThe proposed development due to its height, mass, bulk, design and materiality would present an unduly prominent building which fails to satisfactorily integrate into its surroundings. As such, the proposed development represents a feature that would be incongruous and out of keeping, resulting in a detrimental impact to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 (Character, Design and Heritage), DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012).\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Windows are proposed on all elevations including the southern elevation, however, appropriate conditions could be imposed to mitigate any overlooking impacts to the neighbouring dwellings. Subject to appropriate conditions, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. \r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comment: Policy T6 of the London plan requires 1.5 spaces per 3+ bed dwelling in outer london PTAL 0-1 areas. The proposal would provide one off street parking space which is considered acceptable in this case. \r\rThe development would be required to provide cycle parking in line with the standards contained within Policy T5 of the London Plan. Although no cycle parking is proposed, officers consider that this could be secured via conditions, given the ample space on site.\r\rParagraph 163 of the NPPF states that when determining any planning applications, local planning authorities should ensure that flood risk is not increased elsewhere. Where appropriate, applications should be supported by a site-specific flood risk assessment. This includes all development within Flood Risk Zones 2 and 3.\r\rDevelopment should only be allowed in areas at risk of flooding where, in light of this assessment, it can be demonstrated that:\r-Within the site, the most vulnerable development is located in areas of lowest flood risk, unless there are overriding reasons to prefer a different location.\r-The development is appropriately flood resistant and resilient.\r-It incorporates sustainable drainage systems, unless there is clear evidence that this would be inappropriate.\r-Any residual risk can be safely managed.\r-Safe access and escape routes are included where appropriate, as part of an agreed emergency plan.\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 echo national policy in these regards.\r\rOfficer comment: The replacement dwelling is located within Flood Risk Zone 2. The application has submitted a FRA, however, insufficient information has been provided in regards to the specific flood resilient and resistance measures that would be applied to the scheme. Furthermore, no SuDS strategy has been submitted.  \r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would be flood resistant and flood resilient, would not increase surface water flooding, would not exacerbate/cause flooding elsewhere and provide safe accommodation for future occupiers. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Paragraph 163 of the NPPF 2019 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, Policies D3, D4 and SI 12 of the London Plan (2021) and policies DM4, CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house which shows an original outrigger. The existing side extension is also not part of the original footprint. The proposed extension would therefore extend beyond the side elevation of the original footprint and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) & (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
