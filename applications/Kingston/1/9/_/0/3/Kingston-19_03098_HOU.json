    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development  hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The roof of the development hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the annotations on the approved drawings,  prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted all first floor windows fitted in the side (north and south) elevations, and the ground floor windows fitted in the side (south) elevation as shown on drawing number PL/P-310 Rev E, shall be obscure glazed and be constructed so that no part of the  framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed development is located within 15m of Thames Water's underground assets, as such the development could cause the assets to fail if appropriate measures are not taken. Please read our guide 'working near our assets' to ensure your workings are in line with the necessary processes you need to follow if you're considering working above or near our pipes or other structures. https://developers.thameswater.co.uk/Developing-a-large-site/Planning-your-development/Working-near-or-diverting-our-pipes.",
    "The Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Highways Operation Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins. The team would secure some deposit to ensure that repairing cost is covered should any damage result from the construction associated with this site.\r",
    "A license from the Highways Operation will be required to erect off site direction signs. This same team will issue the hoarding license (if necessary) and seek appropriate deposits.\r",
    "During construction, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads. We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.",
    "Please provide copies of existing and proposed elevations (from the second side) at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work. \rIf the proposed works are not visible from the second side, please provide a shaded outline of the house.\r",
