    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The application site falls within the Grove Crescent Conservation Area.\r \r5 neighbouring properties consulted and 1 objection was received relating to overlooking and privacy. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Area (CAAC)\r\rObjection- re-siting of chimney breast, design of new side/ rear windows, addition of spiral staircase & incorporation of roof terrace all problematic & out of character with the original & surrounding properties. Clearly visible from Grove Lane.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers comment: Following demolition of the existing conservatory a proposed rear extension with roof terrace extending 1m further to the rear is proposed, leaving a gap of roughly 1m between the boundary line of the neighbouring property to the rear. \r\rThe roof terrace is proposed to cover the entire footprint of the replacement rear extension which would measure 4.66m in depth. The total height of the proposed development would be 4.6m. The rear and south-east facades would be faced in brick, while the north-west elevation would incorporate a glass balustrade of 1.1m in height. A spiral staircase leading from ground level up to the roof terrace is proposed on the north west elevation.\r\rThe applicant has drawn officers' attention to a recent development at No. 4-6 Geneva Road (application reference 18/12655/HOU) as evidence that the principle of a roof terrace extension is acceptable. Whilst this neighbouring roof terrace is acknowledged, the applicant is advised that No. 4-6 Geneva Road does not fall within a conservation area and is significantly smaller in scale and bulk, relating well to their host properties and surrounding area. The applicant is also advised that planning applications are assessed on their individual merits.\r\rIn this case the excessive height, bulk and mass of the rear extension and roof terrace, the use of brick for such a large expanse of the rear elevation, the flat roof form, the design and position of the windows in the rear elevation and the sprial staircase would would combine to form an incogruous addition that would not relate well to the host property or the prevailing form and pattern of development in the area. Although views of the rear addition from public vantage points would be limited, it would be clearly visible from nearby properties and buildings. \r\rRoof lights are proposed to both sides of the existing main roof slopes, alongside the removal of the chimney stack. Officers note that rooflights are characteristic of the area and would be acceptable subject to being of a \"conservation area\" style. However, the presence of chimney stacks are a key feature of this area and the original property and the proposed removal of the chimney stack is considered unnaceptable. \r\rOverall, the proposed development would result in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the proposed rear extension extending 1m further to the rear than the existing extension, given the configuration of the site and siting of neighbouring properties and buildings it is considered not to unduly deprive neighbouring properties and buildings of natural light. However, the roof terrace is considered to result in an unacceptable loss of privacy and overlooking in relation to neighbouring habitable rooms at No. 2 Geneva Road.\r\rOverall, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of loss of privacy and overlooking to the habitable rooms of No. 2 Geneva Road, thereby conflicting with Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThis application is, in effect, a revision of a previously approved application, reference 19/02576/HOU. The key revisions are as follows:\r\r- Single storey rear extension increased in depth from approx. 4.4m to 5.4m\r- Two storey side extension increased in height by approx. 300mm\r\r5 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. One objection was received on grounds of loss of privacy.\r\rOfficer response: The application does not propose any new windows versus the already approved scheme. As such, it would not have any material impact on privacy over and above the approved scheme.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The approved two storey side extension was set down from the ridge of the main roof by 500mm and set back from the front wall of the dwelling by 750mm. The current application seeks to raise the ridge of the roof of the extension by approximately 300mm (resulting in it being set down by just 200mm from the main ridge). The front wall of the extension would also come forward to accommodate this change, resulting in a set back of 500mm. Although the degree of set down from the ridge is not in accordance with the Council's guidance, officers are satisfied that the extension would maintain a subordinate appearance owing to the degree of set back from the front wall.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would be well hidden from public view and the proposal to increase its depth would not have any materially detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rOverall, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal to increase the height of the two storey side extension by approximately 300mm would have a very limited impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. However, the proposal to increase the depth of the single storey rear extension would result in it presenting to the occupiers of 35 Oakdene Drive (who do not appear to benefit from any rear extensions of their own) as a 5.4m wide and approximately 3m high brick wall, set right up against the boundary. Officers consider this to be an unneighbourly relationship, in which the development would appear overbearing and would deprive the occupants of 35 Oakdene Drive of a reasonable outlook. The proposal is therefore considered to be unacceptable in terms of its impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. As there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.",
