    "By virtue of its design, size and scale, the proposed part two storey rear extension and rear dormer extension would fail to appear as a subservient addition when read against the rear elevation of the host dwelling. The proposed front dormer extension would appear as an incongruous addition that would appear out-of-keeping within the eastern side of the street scene on Cleveland Road. The proposal would therefore have a harmful impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 34 and 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.",
