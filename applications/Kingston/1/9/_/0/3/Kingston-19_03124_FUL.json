    "The site comprises a first floor flat in a semi-detached property.\r\r17 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections were received. The material issues raised can be summarised as: inappropriate design and layout, loss of light, and loss of privacy. These issues will be considered in this report.\r\rIt should be noted that building control requirements are covered by a separate regime and are not material to the planning process.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rooflights to the side of the roofslope are considered to be in scale with the host property. Further, officers note that rooflights are viewed from the streetscene on Dudley Road, therefore the development would appear in keeping with the surrounding area. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rooflights are sited in a way that would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The application property is a two-storey, semi-detached dwelling located on the eastern side of Upper Park Road, which is a well-established residential area. There is a two-storey side extension that does not appear to be an original feature of the property. The main property has a hipped roof finish that reduces in height to the flat roof above the two-storey side extension. On the opposite side of the property there is a single storey extension that spans the full width of the elevation and adjoins a single storey rear extension, which is also a later addition to the property. The property is not listed nor is it within a conservation area though it is within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The property is located within flood zone 1, as defined by the Environment Agency, though it is within a locally designated Critical Drainage Area. \r\r7 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and no responses were received following the consultation period. \rThe planning history relevant to this application is as follows:\r20/01238/HOU - Replacement roof over the main dwelling and existing two storey side extension to include 3no dormer extensions on the rear elevation with juliet 2no juliet balconies and installation of 2no front rooflights , first floor side extension, two storey front extension and two storey rear extension - refused August 2020\r15/13017/HOU - Erection of replacement roof with rooflights and formation of hipped roof over existing flat roof side extension - granted December 2015\r12/12222/HOU - Erection of Single Storey Side Extension and Two Storey Rear Extension - granted June 2012\r11/12881/HOU - Erection of Single Storey Side Extension, Two Storey Rear Extension and erection of roof extension to include raising the height of existing ridge by 1.2 metres, hip to gable roof extension with Rear Dormer Addition - refused March 2012\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon the character and appearance of the area; and\r- The impact upon residential amenity\r- The impact upon the risk of flooding in the area\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe side additions to the property have created an imbalance to the appearance of the property in terms of height and roof types across the front elevation. Planning ref. 20/01238/HOU was refused due to concerns that the scheme would fail to respect the character of the original property; erode the visual separation gap with neighbouring properties and incorporate an incongruous roof type to the detriment of the character and appearance of the property and the wider area. \r\rIn order to overcome this, the roof type has been amended to a hipped finish that rises to a central flat roof. The result of this is that the visual separation with the neighbour at no. 44 Upper Park Road will be maintained and also have a roof type that is in keeping with the neighbouring properties. Within the rear roofslope, a dormer extension is proposed. It will be centrally positioned and of an appropriate size and design for the roofslope and in the context of the rear elevation. The remaining aspects of the application would be in scale with the the original property and would not have an adverse effect on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe previous refusal did not cite the amenity of neighbouring residents as a concern and the amendments now proposed would not raise any further concerns.At the rear, the single storey aspect of the extension would have a flat roof finish that could be used as a sitting out/balcony area. Any such use could lead to increased overlooking of neighbouring properties as well as increased noise disturbance. A condition can be imposed to prevent any such use and ensure that an acceptable relationship with the neighbours is maintained. \r\rPolicy DM4 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) seeks to ensure that new development does not increase the risk of flooding. Although the site is located within flood zone 1, and therefore at a low risk of flooding, it is within a Critical Drainage Area. However, it is considered that due to the scale and nature of the development, the risk of flooding would not be increased in and around the site. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would be in scale and character with the original property, and that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. Residential amenity for occupants of the property and their neighbours would not be compromised as a result of the development, and the risk of flooding in and around the site would not be increased as a result of the development. In conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace building between Tolworth Broadway and Broad Oaks.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of an additional storey atop the existing single storey rear projection to provide 1no. one bedroom flat.\r\r22 properties were notified of the proposal. 1 objection was received. The only material issue raised was loss of light. This issue will be considered below.\r\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The planning history;\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of the proposed accommodation;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r- The impact of the development on the transport network.\r\rPlanning History\rThe planning history is a material consideration. Planning permission was previously refused under application reference 20/01789/FUL. The reasons for refusing that application were: that the proposal would have offered a poor standard of accommodation by reason of lack of privacy; a lack of cycle parking facilities; and a lack of waste storage facilities.\r\rThe current application is a revision of this preivously refused application. The key changes are that the footprint of the building has been reduced to facilitate the provision of an outdoor amenity area, a reduction in the number of proposed bedrooms from two to one, alterations to the fenestration in the flank elevation, and the provision of cycle parking and waste storage facilities. The test is whether these changes are sufficient to overcome the previous reasons for refusal and render the development acceptable in its own right.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe scheme under consideration involves the provision of housing and the Council cannot demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. Therefore, the \"tilted balance\" as set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF is engaged.\r\rPolicy H1 of the London Plan 2021 sets a target for the Borough of 9,640 net housing completions within the next ten years. Planning decisions should optimise the potential for housing delivery on all suitable and available brownfield sites to ensure that this target is met.\r\rThe proposal would provide one additional dwelling on the site, which would make a small but nonetheless positive contribution towards meeting the Council's housing targets. The site is in an area of mixed land use, which includes a significant proportion of residential uses, and the use of the site for residential purposes is well established. Having regard to these considerations and the fact that the site is not subject to any designations which fundamentally conflict with the type of development proposed, the principle of the development is considered to be acceptable.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 requires boroughs to seek to ensure that new development reflects the Government's technical housing standards. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have a minimum of 50m2 of private garden (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows. Each new flat should have 10m2 (plus an extra 1m2 for each occupant after the first). \r\rThe proposed flat would accord with the requirements of the technical housing standards and would meet the London Plan requirement for a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m. The applicant has demonsrated that the revised fenestration in the flank elevation would not allow users of the adjacent stairway to readily look into the proposed bedroom. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would provide a satisfactory level of privacy for future occupants. A private outdoor amenity space of 10sqm would be provided, which is 1sqm below the requirements of Policy Guidance 13 but is in excess of the requirements of the London Plan Housing SPG.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the standard of the proposed accommodation is considered to be acceptable.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rHaving regard to the context of the site i.e. the presence of the two first floor flats immediately adjacent (which were granted permission on appeal in 2015), the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIt is noted that the two first floor flats immediately adjacent to the site have unobscured windows facing Hamilton Avenue and this relationship was previously found to be acceptable. Officers further note that aside from these two flats, there is a good degree of intervisibility between the properties on Tolworth Broadway/Broad Oaks and Hamilton Avenue in any case. The proposed side facing windows would look out over spaces which are primarily used for parking, which again are already clearly visible from other\rnearby vantage points.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the objection received on grounds of loss of light. However, the proposal would pass the 25 degree test in relation to the nearest habitable room window. Officers also note that the relationship between the proposal and 72A Tolworth Broadway would be very similar to that between 70A and 70B Tolworth Broadway, which was previously found to be acceptable.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rTransport\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan\r\rThe proposal would not involve any new or amended access to the public highway or a material change in the character or volume of traffic entering and leaving the site. \r\rThe proposed flat would not be provided with any off-street car parking spaces. This is in line with local and regional parking standards, which suggest that a maximum of one space should be provided in this case. Officers are mindful that the PTAL of the site is moderate (3) and it is not located within a controlled parking zone. In light of these considerations, officers conclude that the lack of off-street car parking would not result in material harm to neighbouring residents or an adverse impact on highway\rsafety.\r\rIt is noted that the previous application was refused because of the lack of cycle parking facilities. The applicant has now shown dedicated space within the site for one cycle parking space and this level of provision is in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021. It is recommended that full details of this facility be secured by condition.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the safety and operation of the transport network.\r\rOther Matters\rIt is noted that the previous application was refused because of the lack of waste storage facilities. The applicant has now shown dedicated space within the site for waste and recycling storage facilities. It is recommended that full details of this facility be secured by condition.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposal would provide one additional dwelling on the site, which would make a positive contribution towards meeting the Council's housing targets. Officers are satisfied that the proposal would provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation and would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, and on the transport network.\r\rThe proposal is therefore considered to be in accordance with the development plan and officers conclude that there are no adverse impacts which would significantly and demosntrably outweigh the benefits of granting permission, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
