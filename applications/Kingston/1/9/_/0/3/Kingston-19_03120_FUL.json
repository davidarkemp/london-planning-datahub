    "You are reminded that the original planning permission 15/12936/FUL, was subject to a S106 Legal Agreement as amended by Deed of Variation dated 3/12/2018 accompanying application 17/12982/FUL. The obligations secured by the legal agreements remain binding and enforceable following  this amendment application submitted under Section 73 of the Act.",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rThe proposal is for the use of the existing garage as habitable accommodation, together with associated alterations to the front and rear elevations.\r\r8 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the transport network.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would not involve the introduction of any additional built from to the site and the proposed alterations to the front and rear elevations would be consistent with the design of the dwelling. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would not involve the introduction of any additional built form to the site, nor would it involve the addition of any windows at first floor level or above. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
    "Policy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a rear outrigger and a large rear bay window . The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the outrigger and the side elevations of the bay window and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii)  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",

RBK tree officer has reviewed the infomation provided and is satisfied this will not cause any harm to the trees. Officers considers the amendments to be non-material and as such, it is recommends that the application for a non-material amendment be granted.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The application site falls within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area.\r \r4 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rMaldens and Coombe Conservation Area Advisory Committee - no objection.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outrigger extension would extend on the lower and upper ground floor levels to a depth of approximately 4m, and be comparitively narrower in width than the existing. The outrigger would have a hipped roof measuring approximately 4.25m to the eaves and approximately 5.44m to the ridge from ground level. Other associated changes include a cast iron balustrade to the upper ground level outrigger Juliette balcony.  Overall, the proposals in terms of design and materials are considered to be high quality and in keeping with the existing property. \r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers comment: Due to the proposed design and siting of the proposed extension and alterations and their relationship with neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area relates to an area of individually designed detached and semi-detached houses dating from the 1850s set in a mature landscape on the edge of Richmond Park. Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Liverpool Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. As previously mentioned, the proposed extensions and alterations would be in keeping with features of the original house and the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r",
