    "The details submitted for Condition 4 Part 10 (Key Design of New Gabletes for Lambeth Coal Store) of planning permission 19/01212/LBC by the applicant are considered satisfactory and this condition is hereby fully discharged.",
    "The site comprises an end-of-terrace dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal seeks a hip-to-gable conversion and a rear dormer, together with the insertion of two roof lights in the front roof slope. Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that dormers should be set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm and set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm. In this case, the dormer would be set up from the eaves by 252mm and would not be set down from the ridge line nor in from sides of the roof. However, officers are mindful of the fact that this element of the development could likely be carried out under permitted development rights and on this basis, it would be unreasonable to resist it on the grounds of character and appearance.\r\rOfficers consider that the hip-to-gable conversion would unbalance the terrace. However, there are several examples of this in the immediate vacinity and again, this element of the proposal could likely be carried out under permitted development.\r\rThe insertion of roof lights to the front elevation would have a very limited impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the location of the proposed new built from above the existing footprint of the property, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. The proposed fenestration would offer materially similar views to the existing. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, officers consider there to be a limited degree of conflict between the proposal and policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. However, it is a material consideration that the majority, if not all, of the proposal could likely be carried out under permitted development rights. Having regard to this fallback position, officers consider that it would be unreasonable to resist the proposal and recommend that planning permission be granted.",
