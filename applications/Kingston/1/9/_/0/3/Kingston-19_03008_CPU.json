    "The proposed development would meet the criteria of Classes B, C and G of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would be lawful.\r\r*Note to applicant - in order to comply with the conditions of Class B of the Order, any window inserted on a wall or roof slope forming a side elevation of the dwellinghouse must be-\r\r(i) obscure-glazed, and\r\r(ii) non-opening unless the parts of the window which can be opened are more than 1.7 metres above the floor of the room in which the window is installed.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Whilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would conflict with the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 with regards to depth, it is considered that the proposed development would not be materially different to the existing situation. Policy guidance 35 states that side extensions should normally be set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm however, a number of neighbouring properties have extended to the side with no set-back so it is not considered that the proposal would result in any significant harm to the street scene. Overall and on balance the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would not be visible from the street. It is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
