    "The applicant has demonstrated, on the  balance of probabilities, that erection of rear extension and rear dormer, installation of 2x front rooflights  to facilitate loft conversion was substantially complete over 4 years ago and is therfore lawful under Setcion 171B(i) of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a A1 retail unit on Vale Parade which is a small row of mixed use commercial units with residential to the upper floors centre. The site falls within the Kingston Vale Conservation Area. The significance of the Kingston Vale Conservation Area is as an early Victorian village on the London to Portsmouth Road at the Robin Hood Gate entrance to Richmond Park and Wimbledon Common. \r\rIt is noted that the existing shop would be changed to a restaurant, however, this would not require planning permission as both of these uses fall within Class E of The Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) (Amendment) (England) Regulations 2020.\r\rSeventeen neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - Officer questioned a small error he noticed on the drawings. Applicant rectified the error and submitted an amended plan on 25/03/2021. Officer has no objections following this but recommended a condition relating to noise.\r\rMalden & Coombe Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on the Kingston Vale Conservation Area\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy DM12 is clear that the Council will: 'ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area' and preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed flue would be positioned at the rear of the premises and would not be easily seen from the street and would not be an uncommon addition given the commercial uses along the parade. For this reason, It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area and no harm has been identified in relation to the Kingston Vale Conservation Area, thereby complying with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal would not involve any extensions or new windows and so it would not appear overbearing or result in material loss of daylight, sunlight or privacy for neighbouring occupiers. Officers acknowledge there may be an increase in noise due to the mechanics of the flue but note this would not be unusal due to the other businesses along the parade and noise mitigation limits would be secured by condition should permission be granted. The Environmental Health Officer has raised no objection subject to a restrictive planning condition relating to noise.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would comply with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policies CS8, DM12 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019).",
