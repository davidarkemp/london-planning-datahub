    "The application property is a two-storey detached dwelling located on the eastern side of Bowness Crescent, which is a well-established residential area. The property has a single storey flat roof extension to the side, which does not appear to be an original feature of the property. The side boundary of the property to the north adjoins the large rear gardens of Nos. 2-6 Windermere Road; and the host property has a long rear garden with a depth of approximately 28 metres. The property is not listed nor is it within a conservation area, and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity. The property is located within Flood Risk Zone 1, and so at a low risk of flooding. It is also located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\r10 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and no responses were received following the consultation period. \r\rThe planning history relevant to this application is:\r90/0594/FUL - Erection of single storey side extension incorporating garage - approved May 1990\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact upon residential amenity.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe application property comprises a single-storey extension to the side of the property that has a flat roof finish. The proposal would add a pitch to the roof of the existing extension which would continue and integrate with the proposed rear extension. This is considered to be an appropriate addition to the property. The proposed extension would be of a scale appropriate to the original property and would not unduly dominate its resultant appearance. Appropriate materials would also be used to ensure an acceptable appearance. As the proposal would have the appearance of a domestic extension that is in scale with the original property, it is considered that there would not be an adverse effect on the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and the general streetscene. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rAlthough the proposed extension would be adjacent to the boundary with No. 4 Windermere Road, it is considered that there would not be any adverse impact upon the amenity of these neighbours. The neighbour has an extensive rear garden and the residents would be able to enjoy their amenity space without any undue sense of overbearing or dominance from the extension. There is a good separation distance to the neighbour at No. 16 Bowness Crescent and so an acceptable relationship would be maintained. \r\rWhilst the extension would increase the footprint of the property, and so reduce its private amenity space, ample space would remain so that the amenity of the residents would not be compromised. \r\rThe proposed extension would be in scale with the host property and would not have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area or the wider Strategic Area of Special Character. The residential amenity of the occupants of the property and their neighbours would not be compromised as a result of the development.

    "The application property is a two-storey, semi-detached property located on the north side of Northcote Road, which is a well-established residential area. The property has an 'L' shaped footprint with a single storey monopitch extension, which does not appear to be an original feature of the property. The adjoining property has a similar footprint that also includes a single storey addition. A shared passageway provides separation distance from the neighbouring property at No. 86, which has a conservatory added to the rear. The property is not listed, nor is it within a conservation area and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity. The site is located within Flood Risk Zone 1, as defined by the Environment Agency, and is therefore at a low risk of flooding.\r\r2 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and no responses were received following the consultation period. \r\rThere is no planning history relevant to this application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The impact upon the character and appearance of the area; and\r- The impact upon residential amenity.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would involve the loss of the single storey rear addition to the property, though as this is not an original feature of the property and is not considered as having any significant architectural merit, there is no objection to its loss. A single storey side/rear extension with a first floor infill is proposed and these would be in keeping with the scale and character of the original property. The main entrance to the property is via the side elevation where a canopy above the door is proposed. This would be a modest addition to the property and not have any adverse visual impact. The proposal also includes an infill extension at first floor level with the introduction of a hipped roof. Whislt this would result in the squaring off of the appearance of the property it would not adversely affect its original appearance. The works to the rear of the property would not be readily visible from any public viewpoint and it is considered that the development as a whole would not have any adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed development would increase the footprint of the property and thereby reduce the amount of private amenity space at the rear. However, it is considered that ample space would remain for residents to enjoy and undertake their day-to-day activities. Following the demolition of the existing extension, the proposed structure would extend 4.7m away from the property, 2m further beyond the rear elevation of the adjoining property. With an eaves height of 2.5m close to the boundary, it is considered that there would be no overbearing or dominating impact upon this neighbour's amenity area. Due to the orientation of the properties in this built up area, it is considered that the neighbour would not suffer from a loss of natural light to their property. Due to the alignment of the properties, the proposed first floor infill would have no detrimental impact on this neighbour.\r\rOn the opposite side, the property is off-set from the boundary with No. 86 and it is considered that the scale and nature of the development would ensure that an acceptable relationship is maintained. Additional windows are proposed within the side elevation of the property, though given that these would face a shared passageway with No. 86 then no overlooking issues would be experienced. Similarly, it is considered that the first floor infill would have no adverse impact upon the amenity of this neighbouring property.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would be in scale and character with the original property, and that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area.

The proposed single storey side extension would reduce in width and create a separation distance of a minimum of 0.8m from the boundary. It would not be set back from the front elevation but as this would be a continuation of what is existing there would be no adverse effect to the streetscene. The two storey side extension would be set back from the front boundary by 0.5m which is recommended by the Residential Design Guide SPD. The pitched roof would also be set in from the main roof slope and thus would ensure the development is subordinate to the host property.\r\rThe proposed replacement part single storey rear extension would be the same depth as what is existing, would continue the existing roof form and would use materials to match the existing dwelling. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Given the modest width of the proposed development and separation distance it is not likely to adversely affect the amenities of the neighbouring property. Further, all windows to the ground floor side elevation are proposed to be obscure glazed. The single storey rear extension would replace the existing rear conservatory and retain similar dimensions, therefore it would not adversely affect the amenities of the neighbouring properties. \r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

The hipped roof would have a height that is within the parameters recommended by the Residential Design SPD 2013. The development would not be viewed from the streetscene, and all materials proposed would be in keeping with the host property.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

However, due to the existing parapet wall and boundary treatment the proposed extension would not adversely affect the amenities of this neighbouring property. No. 4 Douglas Road would be separated from the proposed development by approx 1.3m, therefore due to its siting would not cause loss of light/sunlight or feeling of overbearing. Two openings are proposed to the side elevation but would offer similar views to what is already existing and therefore would not cause an increase to overlooking for this neighbouring property.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
