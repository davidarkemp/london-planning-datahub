    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:\rAs required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 55 o14/01/20f the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the D1 use hereby permitted shall be used only for counselling therapy services (and allied physiotherapy, osteopathy, chiropractics, sports therapy, acupuncture) and for no other use within Class D1 of the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (or any other Order revoking and reenacting that Order with or without modification).\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of local residents, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    " The D1 use to which this permission relates shall only operate between the hours of 09.00am and 19.00pm Monday to Friday and 09.00am to 18.00pm Saturdays, and not at all on Sundays and Bank Holidays.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of local residents, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a two-storey, semi-detached dwelling located on the northern side of Somerset Avenue, which is a well established residential area. To the side of the property is a single storey garage that adjoins the side boundary with no. 12 Somerset Avenue, which is at a higher level than the application site. This property has a garage/car port structure to the side which then adjoins the side elevation of the main body to the dwelling. The garage at the application property is set back from the front elevation, from which it spans the length of the side of the property. To the rear, there is a single storey conservatory that is not an original feature of the property. The rear garden has a depth of approximately 23m. The site is located within flood zone 2 and is also within the locally designated Critical Drainage Area.\r\rThe planning history relevant to this application is:\r04/10346/FUL - Erection of a single storey rear extension (Conservatory) - granted December 2004\r\r6 neighbouring properties were notified of the application, with one response received. The response is a neutral comment questioning where rainwater will be discharged to.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and\r- Whether the proposal would increase the risk of flooding in and around the site. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe development involves the demolition of an existing conservatory at the property, which is not an original feature. It is not considered as having significant architectural merit, so there is no objection to its loss. The proposed replacement would have a pitch roof finish, with ridge and eaves height of 3.6m and 2.6m respectively and a rearward projection of 3m. To the front of the property, the extension would align with the existing front porch and there are examples of properties in the vicinity whereby porch and side extensions align at the front, so there would be no adverse impact upon the streetscene. The development would accord with the parameters of the Residential Design Guide and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy, and so there would be no adverse impact in terms of the character and appearance of the surrounding area or the host property. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIt is considered that an acceptable relationship with the adjoining property at no. 16 would be maintained given that the dimensions of the proposed extension would be similar to the existing structure in relation to this neighbour. No. 12 has a higher ground level and a full length structure to the side so there would be no adverse impact upon this neighbour.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. This can be achieved by an appropriately worded condition, and given the modest scale and nature of the development the risk of flooding would not be increased in and around the site, and thereby comply with policy DM4 of the Core Strategy.\r\rThere are no concerns that the proposal would result in an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area, have a detrimental impact upon residential amenity or highway safety, nor increase the risk of flooding in and around the site. In conclusion, the proposed development would be in general compliance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
