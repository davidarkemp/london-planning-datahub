    "The works hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this consent.\r\rReason: As required by Section 18 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "All existing features shall remain undisturbed in their existing position, and shall be fully protected during the course of works on site unless expressly specified in the approved drawings.\r\rReason: In order that the special architectural and historic interest of this Listed Building is safeguarded.\r",
    "Any damage to the building caused by or during the course of the carrying out of the work permitted shall be made good within 3 months of the completion of the development, in accordance with a specification agreed in writing with the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To safeguard the character and appearance of the Listed Building in accordance with policy CS8 of the Core Strategy, development management policies DM10 and DM12 and policy 7.8 of the London Plan (2016).\r",
    "The details submitted for Condition 8 (Cycle Shelter) of planning permissions 18/10212/FUL by the applicant are considered satisfactory. As such, Conditions 8 is hereby fully approved.",
    "Due to the nature of the proposed amendments and the sensitivity of the site, including the site's location within the Southborough Conservation Area, the Grade II Listing of the building and the number of trees on the site which are subject to Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs), it is considered that the proposal would not constitute a non-material amendment.",
    "The site comprises a mid-terrace dwelling and falls within the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character (LASC) which is a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r-The impact of the proposed development on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\r3 neighbouring properties were notified of the proposals and 2 objections were received. The material issues raised are summarised below:\r\r- Harm to the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- Loss of light.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the location of the proposed development to the rear of the property it would not be readily visible from public vantage points and would be of a subordinate nature. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing Non-designated heritage assets of archaeological interest, which are demonstrably of equivalent significance to scheduled monuments, should be considered subject to the policies for designated heritage assets.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should generally be no more than 3m to 3.5m in depth. This may be increased where neighbouring properties have different rear building lines. In this case, No. 116 Durlston Road does not benefit from any rear extensions and its rear building line sits behind that of the application site. Whilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have a staggered rear building line, it would be set hard hard up against the shared boundary and extend 4m beyond that of the neighbouring property As such it uwould appear overbearing and unneighbourly. Furthermore, the proposed extension would fail the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest ground floor, principal, habitable room window at No.116 Durlston Avenue, resulting in an unacceptable adverse impact on daylight/sunlight. As such, it is considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No.116 Durlston Road by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted. As such it is recommended that planning permission be refused.",
    "Invalid block plan provided \r\rPlease provide a copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "Please confirm description of proposed works \"Installation of new Slim Line Streetpole with built-in cabinet and 3no.x separate equipment cabinets\"",
    "This application seems to be in duplication to previous submission. Application ref: 21/02624/PRE, although the assessment seems to differ.\r\rPlease confirm and advise if this application ref. 21/02659/PRE  to be cancelled so that our records can be updated."
