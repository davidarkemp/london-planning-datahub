    "The conversion of garage into habitable room (notably the external alterations) falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class  A  of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The use of the space for habitable accommodation would not constitute development.",
    "The site comprises an of terrace dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to recommended depths. However, considering the modest height of the proposal (eaves height approx. 2.2m and height of the pitched roof approx. 3.4m), its siting and size of the application site, the proposed rear extension is considered acceptable. uIt is noted that the adjoining property benefits from an existing single storey rear extension. \r\rThe proposed extension would be visible from the street, however, due to its modest scale, siting, design and the proposed materials, it is considered that there would be no significant impact on either the existing streetscene of Barnfield Gardens or Barnfield Avenue, or the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposed development would meet BRE guidelines, passing the 45 degree rule in both plan and elevation view in relation to No. 139  Barnfield Avenue.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
