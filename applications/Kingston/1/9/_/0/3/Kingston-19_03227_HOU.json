    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the building shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the side-facing dormer window to the eastern roofslope shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of Level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks a part single, part two storey side and rear extension.\r\r12 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extensions would be large in scale but the majority of their bulk would be obscured from view, with only the first floor extension above the existing study being particularly noticeable. The proposed false pitch roof would be rather unconvincing, but it would be pitched nonetheless and would not be unique for Barnfield Avenue, since No. 183 has recently constructed an almost identical set of extensions (planning application reference 17/13166/HOU). The proposed design for the two storey element otherwise generally reflects the Council's guidance, being set back from the main facade of the house, set down considerably from the main ridge, and set in appropriately from the side boundary. Meanwhile, the single storey element would be modest in depth and would appear as a typical modern domestic extension.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The adjoining semi-detached property, No. 185, benefits from an existing single storey rear extension of the same depth of that currently proposed. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would not have any material impact on the occupiers of this property in terms of loss of light or overbearing appearance.\r\rThe relationship between the application property and the other adjoining neighbour, No. 189, is such that the proposed extensions would be well separated from the boundary and would not appear overbearing or result in any materially harmful loss of light.\r\rIn the case of both neighbours, the proposed fenestration would offer similar views to the existing and would not result in any material loss of privacy.\r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of a rear conservatory, following demolition of the existing conservatory.\r\r3 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Flood risk.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

The applicant has duly provided this document, which sets out measures to reduce the risk of flooding to the development. Officers recommend a condition with the effect that floor levels should be set no lower than the existing and that electrical sockets should be positioned at least 750mm above finished floor level. Subject to this condition, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not increase the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Please provide revised existing and proposed plans/elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rPlease note that these should be clearly titled as existing and proposed. They should also show a scale bar/key dimension.\r\rPlease note that as stated the drawings to be marked as existing and proposed (not pre existing and existing) as planning permission has not yet been granted for the works.  Please amend and re submit.",
    "Please provide a revised copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rThe block plan should scale at 1:500 and indicate the area of the  proposed works.",
