    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/02855/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the height and depth of the proposed ground floor extension. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in a development that would have appeared excessive in scale in relation to the host dwelling. The proposed depth and height of the single storey rear extension has not been amended from the previously refused application, and as such, officers consider that this reason for refusal has not been addressed. \r\rWhile the proposed two storey side extension would not set back appropriately from the front elevation at first floor level, or set down from the ridge of the original roofslope, it would have a modest width, be set in appropriately from the shared boundary, and would propose a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling. As such, officers consider that the proposed development would appear an appropriate addition to the host property and would not appear an incongruous addition to the immediate surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed front extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would partly extend over the first floor rear outrigger, however given that it would be set down from the ridge and would not span the width of the roofslope, officers consider it would appear a subordinate feature to the original dwelling, and would not detract from the appearance of the immediate vicinity\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the height, depth and siting of the proposed single storey rear extension, it would not pass the 45-degree plan or elevation test in relation to the closest habitable window of adjoining property No. 33 Alric Avenue, and as such officers consider the proposed extension would unduly comprise the amenities of No.33 Alric Avenue, by reason of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance.\r\r However given the separation distance between the proposed single storey rear extension and neighbouring property No. 49 Alric Avenue, officers consider the proposed extension would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 49 Alric Avenue, by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light/sunlight or loss of privacy.\r\rFurther, given the separation distance of the two storey side extension, front extension and roof dormer from the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rOfficers note that a window is proposed to the side elevation at first floor level, and while it would replace a window of similar size, given that it would extend closer to the shared boundary, to mitigate against any loss of privacy officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition in the event of an approval, to ensure the window is obscure glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would demolish the existing garage, given that the internal dimensions would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking.\r\rFurther, while the proposed development would construct an integral garage, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would also not comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a cafe on the southern side of St Mark's Hill and falls within Surbiton District Centre.\r\rProposal\rErection of a new pergola to rear outdoor seating area\r\rConsultation\r14 Surrounding properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that permission has already been granted for use as an outdoor seating area. The proposed pergola would be a marked improvement on the current awning in use. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site comprises a terraced building located on the northern side of Richmond Road.

It would be acceptable in terms of scale, form and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposal, thereby complying with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. \r\rHighways and transportation\rAs stated above the proposal is considered to be appropriate in relation to the commercial nature of the host premises and would not lead to a proliferation of signage or visual clutter within the streetscene. The proposed signage would be static and would neither impede any highway information or directional signs. The proposed illumination levels of the signage would be appropriate in the site context and that of Richmond Road Local Centre and be controlled by condition.  The proposal would not impede the free flow of highway movement, or have any adverse impact on highway safety. Officers consider that the proposal would comply with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rAmenity\rGiven the scale, form and design of the proposal, it is considered not to have a detrimental visual impact upon the occupants of nearby properties or natural surveillance.  As stated above, the proposed illumination levels of the signage would be appropriate in the site context and that of a Local Centre and be controlled by condition. As such, the proposals are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. The significance of the Fairfield / Knights Park Conservation Area is as an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre. It contains houses of various sizes and designs, dating mainly from 1820 to 1900 and focused around Fairfield Recreation Ground, which has been a recreational open space since 1855.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey infill to side/rear extension\r\rConsultation\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objection - not visible from street\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to consider in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 33 and no. 35A Mill Street. due to the exising situation the proposed development would not effect No. 35a Mill Street. With regards to No. 33 Mill Street, due to the seperation distance and limited height due to the proposed pitched roof the proposed extension would comply with BRE guidance in relation to loss of daylight/sunlight.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment: \rAs stated above it is considered that the proposed development would not have any adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the host property, or the surrounding area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would preserve the character and appearance and significance of the Fairfield / Knights Park Conservation Area. Since no harm to heritage assets has been identified it is not necessary to weigh the proposals against public benefit.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "CONSULTATIONS: \rNo representations have been received. \r\rHistoric England: Authorise delegated determination. No views expressed on the proposal.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS: \rThe application site is located on the northern side of London Road and comprises of a long range of twelve Grade-II* two-storey dwellinghouses. \r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in character with residential and commercial land uses.\r\rThe site does not fall within a Conservation Area, but does lie within the Old London Road Area of Special Character and Kingston Town Centre Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rPROPOSAL: \rListed Building Consent is sought for proposed works to the brickwork and additional structural strengthening to the north wall only of central hall to Cleaves Almshouses, (existing north gable wall has two small areas of bulges and split brickwork in the core of the wall).\r\rASSESSMENT: \rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the current Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. \rThe key planning consideration relevant in the assessment of this application is set out under the heading below: \r\rImpact upon the Listed Building: \rThe principle of conducting repair work to a heritage asset is acceptable subject to compliance with the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and Development Plan policies. \r\rSection 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states that 'In considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.' \r\rNPPF provisions: \rIt is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. \r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 202 goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rThis application proposes repair works affecting a Grade II* listed building. The application hereby submitted solely seeks listed building consent for repair works to the external façade by way of facing brick structure repairs to select areas of the North Gable wall only to the Central Hall facing the garden, as well as the insertion of steel strengthening straps/ties between the apex section of the North Gable wall brickwork and the existing timber roof structure in the loft space. \r\rNo works are proposed internally and no external works are otherwise proposed to those stated above.\r\rHistoric England advises that in those instances where repair works are proposed which is necessary to sustain the heritage asset, this is normally desirable if: \r\r- There is sufficient information to understand comprehensively the impacts of the proposals on the significance of the place; and \r- The long-term consequences of the proposals can, from experience, be demonstrated to be benign or the proposals are designed so as not to prejudice alternative solutions in the future; and \r- The proposals are designed to avoid or minimise harm, if actions necessary to sustain particular heritage values tend to conflict. \r\rThe extent of the repair should typically be limited to what is reasonably necessary to make failing elements sound and capable of continuing to fulfil their intended functions. \r\rRepairs to brickwork should accurately match the bond, colour, texture, dimensions and pointing of the original brickwork. Any features such as rubbed brick arches or decorative mouldings should be retained, and where necessary repaired or reinstated. \r\rNon-invasive structural surveys have identified areas where brick facings have displaced outwards and the solid brickwork has split in the centre core of the wall with header bricks snapped. The proposals involve the structural tie of the split brickwork together with stainless steel helical ties drilled into the bricks and resined in position. The proposals also involve the removal and rebuilding of the solid handmade clay bricks to match the existing elevation brickwork finishes/patterns but retaining as many of the existing sound bricks as possible. The application additionally proposes the strengthening and tie of the existing apex brickwork of the gable wall to the existing timber roof structures, ceiling joists, bressumer beam, external wall plate above the Hall with mild steel straps and brackets, all of which would be added to the existing roof structure timbers. The works would not necessitate intrusive alterations to the existing timbers. The proposed works could be removed / reversed in the future if required.\r\rTaking into consideration the submitted plans and supplementary heritage information, the proposed repair works to the brickwork are deemed to be appropriate as the least interventionist and most sympathetic approach for the repair which would improve the overall character and appearance of the heritage asset. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade II* Listed Building, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the heritage asset as per the requirements of the NPPF 2021.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling on a corner plot. \r\rThe property is not located within a conservation area however part of the rear garden is located within Flood Risk Area 2.\r\rThe proposal seeks permission for the erection of single storey side and rear extension, revised front porch, new front bay window, revised first floor dormer and demolition of side chimney.\r\rThe proposal seeks to address the concerns of the refused scheme (21/02046/HOU - Erection of single storey side and rear extension, revised front porch, new front bay window, revised first floor dormer and demolition of side chimney), by the following:\r\rThe proposed side extension and eaves have been reduced in height;\rReduction in scale and width of the glazed gable element\rRemoval of the windows to the front elevation of the proposed side extension;\rReduction to the scale of the rear dormer\rThe boundary fence has been reinstated;\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rPolicy Guidance 35 (Single Storey Side Extensions) states that the following guidance should be followed when designing a single storey side extension:\r- The roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form, and the height of the roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the second storey.\r- The extension should remain proportionate and subordinate to the original house, so that in general, the width of the extension does not exceed 50% of that of the original house.\r-The extension should be set in from the boundary by at least 250mm so guttering does not overhang adjoining land.\r- Side extensions should normally be set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm.\r- Features such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house.\r- Side extensions to semi-detached dwellings should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property.\r\rThe side element of the proposed ground floor extension would measure 2.8m metres in height, where it would join with the flank wall of the Host Property. The side element of the proposed ground floor extension would not be set in from the boundary with Dennan Road, however this would be partially obscured from the street scene by the boundary fencing.\r\rOfficers note this submission addresses concerns raised in the refused scheme, given the  reduction in the scale and width of the proposed side extension, reduction of glazed gable element of the proposal and the inclusion of boundary fencing to the Dennan Road boundary of the site.\r\rAlthough a prominent corner plot give the proposed single storey side and rear extension by reason of its scale and design, would appear a proportionate addition to the original dwelling and would not erode the character and appearance within the immediate streetscene, in accordance with  the Residential Design SPD (2013) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rPolicy Guidance 39 (Dormer Windows) states that the following guidance should be followed when designing a dormer window:\rDormer windows should be designed so that they:\r-are set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm;\r-are set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm;\r-do not feature on the front slope of the roof (in most cases);\r-are designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area;\r-match or line-up with any original windows below; and,\r-are not built in the style of a mansard roof\r\rThe proposed rear dormer would have a height of 1.5 metres, a width of 3.7 metres and would replace an existing dormer with a height of 1.45 metres and a width of 3.8 metres. Given the modest increase the proposed rear dormer extension, would appear a proportionate addition to the original dwelling, would not erode the symmetry of the application property with the adjoining semi detached house at 83 Ellerton Road and would maintain and respect the consistent pattern of neighbouring rear dormer development, immediately in Ellerton Road. Officers also consider this proposal to have addressed the concerns raised in the refused submission.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  In terms of neighbouring residential amenity, the main property to consider is No. 83 Ellerton Road. There is an existing rear extension at this property and it is considered that the proposed single storey side and rear extension, revised front porch, new front bay window, revised first floor dormer and demolition of the side chimney, would not affect the amenities of the occupiers of 83 Ellerton Road to an unacceptable degree by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk \r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: As set out above, the application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe applicants have submitted a Flood Risk Assessment which states the proposed works would not be located within the flood risk zone and that the rear garden is lower than the existing house, however any external paving proposed would be permeable. As such, the proposed development is considered not to conflict with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received relating to enhancing biodiversity and the potential to increase swift habitat enhancement.\r\rWhile officers note the importance of incorporating biodiversity enhancement measurements in planning developments, given that this would be a small scale householder development, officers consider that it would be unreasonable to apply a condition requiring the applicant to incorporate swift habitat enhancement measures into the proposed development. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed two storey side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set back at first floor level, officers note that it would be designed to respect the character of the original dwelling, and would appear modest in scale, and as such would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. Further, given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed ground floor rear extension would also not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, given that it would have an appropriate height, officers consider it would appear a modest addition to the host property. Further, given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the closest habitable windows of neighbouring properties, and that neighbouring properties benefit from similar existing extensions, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rWhile openings are proposed to the west elevation at first floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy, officers consider that a condition can be imposed to ensure that the windows are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment:  While the proposal would include the demolition of the existing detached garage to the rear of the dwelling, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. \r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking, and while the proposal would sever the access to the rear of the dwelling and demolish the existing garage, given that the proposal would include storage accessed from the front of the dwelling, officers consider that cycle parking could be accommodated here. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "CONSULTATIONS: \rNo representations have been received. \r\rHistoric England: Authorise delegated determination. No views expressed on the proposal.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS: \rThe application site is located on the northern side of London Road and comprises of a long range of twelve Grade-II* two-storey dwellinghouses. \r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in character with residential and commercial land uses.\r\rThe site does not fall within a Conservation Area, but does lie within the Old London Road Area of Special Character and Kingston Town Centre Area of Archaeological Significance. \r\rPROPOSAL: \rPlanning permission is sought for proposed works to the brickwork and additional structural strengthening to the north wall only of central hall to Cleaves Almshouses, (existing north gable wall has two small areas of bulges and split brickwork in the core of the wall).\r\rASSESSMENT: \rThe application has been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) and the current Development Plan which consists of the London Plan and the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy. \r\rThe key planning consideration relevant in the assessment of this application is set out under the heading below: \r\rImpact upon the Listed Building: \rThe principle of conducting repair work to a heritage asset is acceptable subject to compliance with the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and Development Plan policies. \r\rSection 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states that 'In considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.' \r\rNPPF provisions: \rIt is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. \r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 202 goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rThis application proposes repair works affecting a Grade II* listed building. The application hereby submitted solely seeks listed building consent for repair works to the external façade by way of facing brick structure repairs to select areas of the North Gable wall only to the Central Hall facing the garden, as well as the insertion of steel strengthening straps/ties between the apex section of the North Gable wall brickwork and the existing timber roof structure in the loft space. \r\rNo works are proposed internally and no external works are otherwise proposed to those stated above.\r\rHistoric England advises that in those instances where repair works are proposed which is necessary to sustain the heritage asset, this is normally desirable if: \r- There is sufficient information to understand comprehensively the impacts of the proposals on the significance of the place; and \r- The long-term consequences of the proposals can, from experience, be demonstrated to be benign or the proposals are designed so as not to prejudice alternative solutions in the future; and \r- The proposals are designed to avoid or minimise harm, if actions necessary to sustain particular heritage values tend to conflict. \r\rThe extent of the repair should typically be limited to what is reasonably necessary to make failing elements sound and capable of continuing to fulfil their intended functions. \r\rRepairs to brickwork should accurately match the bond, colour, texture, dimensions and pointing of the original brickwork. Any features such as rubbed brick arches or decorative mouldings should be retained, and where necessary repaired or reinstated. \r\rNon-invasive structural surveys have identified areas where brick facings have displaced outwards and the solid brickwork has split in the centre core of the wall with header bricks snapped. The proposals involve the structural tie of the split brickwork together with stainless steel helical ties drilled into the bricks and resined in position. The proposals also involve the removal and rebuilding of the solid handmade clay bricks to match the existing elevation brickwork finishes/patterns but retaining as many of the existing sound bricks as possible. The application additionally proposes the strengthening and tie of the existing apex brickwork of the gable wall to the existing timber roof structures, ceiling joists, bressumer beam, external wall plate above the Hall with mild steel straps and brackets, all of which would be added to the existing roof structure timbers. The works would not necessitate intrusive alterations to the existing timbers. The proposed works could be removed / reversed in the future if required.\r\rTaking into consideration the submitted plans and supplementary heritage information, the proposed repair works to the brickwork are deemed to be appropriate as the least interventionist and most sympathetic approach for the repair which would improve the overall character and appearance of the heritage asset. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade II* Listed Building, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the heritage asset as per the requirements of the NPPF 2021.\r",
