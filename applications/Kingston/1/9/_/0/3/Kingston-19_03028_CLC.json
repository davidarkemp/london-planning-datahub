    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rSix neighbouring peoperties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed side infil extension towards the rear of the property would not be visable from the street and would infill a small area between the original rear elevation and the existing rear extension. The proposed subterranean element of the development involves the enlargement of the existing basement towards the front of the property, with the introduction of a lightwell under the ground floor bay window to allow ingress of daylight. A basement inmpact assessement has been provided by a structural engineer to support the application and no potential issues from increasing the footprint of the basement have been identified. Whilst the proposed lightwell would be visible at the front of the property, it is considered to be unobtrusive and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the character and appearance of with the host property or the immediate surruounding area,\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the existing layout of both No. 11A and No. 11, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
