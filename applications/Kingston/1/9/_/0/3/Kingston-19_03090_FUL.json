    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of a garage and shed and construction of a garden room for the use of the occupiers of the house as ancillary accommodation (retrospective)\r\rConsultation\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified an 1 letter of objection has been received.\r\rThe letter recieved questions ownership. For clarity this application relates only to No. 30 Aragon Road and, in the absence of any evidence to the contrary, Officers consider that the correct certificate of ownership has been signed.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed outbuilding would be approximately 6.5m in width, 4.5m in depth and 2.5m in height with a flat roof and a narrrow chimney 1.27m in height. Due to the limited height of the proposed outbuilding, its siting, positioning of windows and openings and relationship to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The use of the outbuilding as ancillary to the residential use of the main dwelling would be secured by condition should permission be granted.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises an end terrace dwelling.\r\rProposal\rConversion of garage into habitable space. Alteration to front elevation, addition of front bay window. Internal alteration\r\rConsultation\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- Car and Cycle Parking; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that No. 40 and No. 46 have Bay windows to the front elevation and are of similar style. For this reason the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.  Officers note there is access to the rear garden and although the loss of the garage would also results in the loss of possible cycle storage, future cycle parking could be provided in the rear garden.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

    "Given the above it is considered that the proposed modifications would not  be materially different to the approved development and as such the S96A application for a non-material amendment is accepted.  \r\rRecommendation:  Grant  NMA application under the provisions of Section 96A of the Act, subject to condition.",
    "The site\rThe site relates to a two storey purpose built residential building for the elderly, located within Chessington.\r\rRelevant Planning History\rPlanning permission granted 12 December 1989 for Redevelopment by erection of two storey block of 34 sheltered flats for the elderly and wardens flat with communal facilities and car parking (revised siting and elevational treatment) - reference 88/0831.\r\rProposal\rThis application is submitted under Section 96A and seeks alterations to the above consented scheme. The changes proposed under this NMA relate to the use of the wardens flat, and seeks to allow its use as age restricted accommodation, amending the description of the description from  34no. units as consented to 35no. flats, together with associated updates to conditions 3 and 15 to remove reference to a wardens flat.\r\rConsideration\rSection 96A gives Councils the power to make non-material changes to planning permission. The legislation states:\r(1) A local planning authority may make a change to any planning permission (granted following an application to the authority), relating to land in their area if they are satisfied that the change is not material.\r(2) In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission.\r(3) The power conferred by subsection (1) includes power to make a change to a planning permission,\r(a) to impose new conditions\r(b) to remove or alter existing conditions\r(4) The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only on an application made by or on behalf of a person with an interest in the land to which the planning permission relates.\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it.\r\rThe Nature of the Use\rIt is necessary to consider whether the removal of the Warden's flat would remove an element of care and potentially involve a change of use from Class A2 to Class C3.\r\r-Use Class C2 is described in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) as 'residential institutions' and includes use of the provision of residential accommodation and care to people in need of care (other than a use within Class C3). Article 2 of the Order defines 'care' as meaning personal care for people in need of such care by reason of, amongst other things, old age. \r- Use Class C3 is described as 'dwellinghouses' and includes use by (a) a single person or by people living together as a family and b) not more than 6 residents living together as a single household (care can be provided if e.g. part of a supported housing scheme).\r\rThe annex to the NPPF defines Older people: \"People over or approaching retirement age, including the active, newly retired through to the very frail elderly; and whose housing needs can encompass accessible, adaptable general needs housing through to the full range of retirement and specialised housing for those with support or care needs'. \r\rAs such, the applicant notes that the requirements for housing are very different and the need for live-in assistance and a Warden's flat can vary significantly across different homes. The applicant also cites case law where the difference between the use of C2 and C3 units to provide age restricted accommodation has been well tested through appeals and high court decisions. One prominent example is Leelamb Homes v Maldon District Council, which determined that where two or more hours of care are provided, it is generally accepted to fall under a C2 classification. \r\rIt is advised that Arbrook Court offers independent retirement living. It does not provide care services, however provides support to enable residents to live independently, including a 24 hour alarm system, laundry and maintenance services, alongside communal facilities with frequent social events.\r\rIt is advised that due to the way in which Arbrook Court is managed, and the level of assistance required there is no requirement for a live-in manager. However, the presence of the flat as consented increases the running costs of the site, which in turn increased the service charge for residents. In response to residents raising concerns over this service charge, My Future Living have been reviewing their portfolio and where appropriate are seeking to reutilise the Housing Managers Flats where they are no longer required. As part of this review, My Future Living have held ballots amongst residents to determine the properties where a managers flat is no longer required, and are seeking to reutilise the flats where this is the case. Following a vote of the current residents of Arbrook Court, it was established there was no longer a requirement for a Housing Manager's Flat. As such, it is proposed that through the removal of the occupancy restriction on the Housing Managers Flat, this can be reutilised as an additional age restricted dwelling within the building.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the removal of the wardens flat would not materially change the use of the building, which would remain as independent retirement living/ sheltered housing. The number of sheltered flats would increase from 34 to 35, the remaining support services are not affected by this proposal. \rThe warden flat is located at ground floor level and the submitted floor plan indicates that it  has a floor area of 38sqm with a separate bedroom,  which would be appropriate for use as 1  person 1 bed  sheltered accommodation. \rOverall, the  general form and nature of the development remains as consented by 88/0831, the changes proposed are considered a non material variation.\r\r",
    "Consultations\r38no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received. \r\rRBK Environmental Health: No objection; subject to condition relating to construction hours, land contamination and a pre-occupation condition of any Class E premises relating to the requirement for an acoustic report and sound transmission reduction scheme to be submitted to the local planning authority for approval.\r\rPlanning History\rNo relevant planning history.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the part change of use of ground floor from Class E (Retail) to C3 (Dwellinghouses), erection of part first/part second floor rear extension and erection of first floor extension to rear of site to enable alterations to 2nos. existing flats at first floor, creation of 2nos. flats at ground floor, and 1no. maisonette at the rear. Including bicycle and refuse storage.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the southern side of Burlington Road, New Malden, at the junction with Queens Road. \rThe site comprises of two terraced buildings. To the ground floor are commercial retail units, with the upper floors comprising of two self-contained residential flats. \r\rAccess to the shops is from both the front along Burlington Road and rear off Queens Road, with an alleyway to the rear of the buildings providing through access to the row of commercial premises. Access to the upper residential flats is achieved from a side door off Queens Road.\r\rThe immediate surrounding area is characterised by a mix of commercial, institutional and residential uses due to the site's location on Burlington Road in New Malden. Queens Road is predominantly residential, comprising late Victorian terraced houses and post-war dwellings.\r\rIn terms of designations, the site is located in a designated Local Centre. The site does not fall within a conservation area and the building is not statutorily listed or registered as a locally listed building. There are no buildings of heritage interest in proximity to the site. The site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) of 3, representing a moderate level of public transport accessibility.\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r-\tThe Principle of Development;\r-\tThe Resultant Standard of Accommodation;\r-\tThe Impact upon the Residential Amenity;\r-\tThe Impact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area; \r-\tThe Impact upon Highway Safety;\r-\tRefuse/Recycling Provision; \r-\tSustainability; \r-\tFlood Risk and Drainage; \r-\tFire Safety; and\r-\tCommunity Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rLoss of / Reduction of Retail Floorspace\rParagraph 81 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021) sets out that: 'Planning policies and decisions should help create the conditions in which businesses can invest, expand and adapt. Significant weight should be placed on the need to support economic growth and productivity, taking into account both local business needs and wider opportunities for development.' \r\rPolicy DM17 (Protecting Existing Employment Land and Premises) sets out that the Council will protect all employment land and premises in Surbiton District Centre to enhance its vitality and viability and promote employment growth through regeneration initiatives including new and improved facilities, improvements to the quality of the office stock, access and public realm.\r\rPolicy DM17 is clear that alternative uses will not be acceptable unless it has been demonstrated by sound evidence and rigorous marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. Mixed use development schemes should not result in a net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land) and should not compromise the viability of the site and/or its surroundings for employment purposes.\r\rPolicy DM19 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will support local shops and resist their loss (particularly convenience shops) in Local Centres and outside designated centres. Applications for a change of use that would threaten the predominance of Class A1 uses will be resisted.\r\rThe existing site comprises of two retail units. Unit A is approximately 75.5sqm in size and Unit B is approximately 108sqm in area. The proposals would see Unit A reduced to 36sqm and Unit B would be reduced to 45sqm. \r\rThe proposed development would remove retail floorspace which is also considered to be employment floorspace for the purposes of Policy DM17 above. No rigorous marketing or evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for the ongoing use of the unit for employment/retail purposes. \r\rThe net loss of employment/retail floorspace within the designated Burlington Road Local Centre, would be resisted without robust evidence and marketing to demonstrate that the use of the whole of the ground floor premises for employment/retail uses is no longer required.\r\rAddition of Housing\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThis application proposes 3no. net additional residential units, thereby making a small, but positive contribution towards these annual housing targets. In addition, the Council are currently unable to demonstrate a 5 year supply of land for the delivery of housing. As such, the 'tilted balance' and Paragraph 11(d) of the NPPF 2021 is a material planning consideration.\r\rPrinciple of Development - Conclusion\rThe proposed development would result in a net loss of employment and retail floorspace within Burlington Road Local Centre and no marketing or robust evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that there is no demand for the ongoing use of the whole of the premises in an employment/retail use. The proposal would result in a net loss of floorspace to a retail unit. \r\rWhile the proposal would make a positive contribution to the Borough's five year housing land supply, it is not considered that this would outweigh the issues in principle identified above which would carry substantial weight against the scheme.\r\rStandard of Accommodation \rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                             \rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.              \r\rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe application proposes the alteration of 2no. existing flats to the first floor, together with the addition of 3no. units (including 1no. maisonette-type unit). \r\rThe two existing flats would comprise 1 x 1-bed, 2-person size and 1 x 2-bed, 3-person size unit and would total 51sqm and 61sqm, respectively. The accommodation for these units would meet the minimum floorspace requirements set out by the London Plan 2021. \r\rThe 3no. proposed units to be proposed added to the building include 1x1-bed, 2-person unit (to the ground floor), 1x2-bed, 4-person unit (maisonette/duplex unit) and 1x3-bed, 4-person unit (within the roofspace). The proposed accommodation would total 50sqm, 87sqm and 76sqm respectively. The accommodation for these newly proposed units would either meet or exceed the minimum floorspace standards stipulated by the London Plan, 2021.\r\rDedicated storage cupboards/space has been shown on the floorplans to achieve at least the minimum standards set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan. \r\rAll of the proposed flats would benefit from adequate natural light and ventilation, as well as a reasonable outlook. \r\rFrom the submitted sections, the floor to ceiling heights would equate to 75% of the accommodation being above 2.5m, in accordance with Policy D6.\r\rPG13 of the Residential Design Guidance states that \"…although in different character areas levels of private amenity space may vary considerably the minimum standards for private gardens should be achieved, and where possible exceeded for all new residential development, unless it can be demonstrated that this would be at odds with the prevailing physical context and local character of development, e.g. town centre....\"\r\rThe SPG guidance as quoted above is an acknowledgement that under certain site characteristics the provision of private or communal amenity space will be difficult. Any under-provision must be balanced against other policy aims which may weigh in favour of the scheme. In this case the redevelopment of previously developed land, in a sustainable location, providing a mix of dwelling units to meet the diverse housing needs of local residents. \r\rBoth of the proposed ground floor flats would be provided with external amenity space in the form of small courtyards both totalling 15sqm. The larger of the two existing flats (i.e. the2-bed, 3-person unit) to the first floor would be provided with a roof terrace totalling 10sqm. The proposed 3-bed, 4-person unit to the converted roofspace would also be provided with a roof terrace to approximately 15sqm. Officers consider the external amenity spaces as proposed to offer good-quality, good-sized areas for occupants' use. One of the pre-existing flats would not be provided with private outdoor space, however, in this instance this is accepted given it did not previously have external amenity space and the creation of a balcony would likely result in privacy issues to the other elements of the scheme. Officers also note that public open space at Blagdon Park is located north of the site, at approximately 2-minute walking distance from the site. \r\rThe scheme, application site and wider characteristics of the area, are suitable to accept the slight deficit of private amenity space provision for one of the (pre-existing) units in this instance.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed flats are considered to ensure privacy is retained and overlooking is not increased. High level windows at ground floor have been implemented to serve the bedrooms facing onto Queens Road, with additional fenestration and main outlook provided by the glazing/patio doors onto the courtyard spaces. Separation distance from neighbouring dwellings is considered acceptable and the proposal is not considered to compromise the privacy of, or increase overlooking towards, neighbouring properties. Officers additionally note that the adjacent dwellinghouse to the south of the application site fronting Queens Road has a blank gable wall facing the site.\r\rIt is considered that the overall mass and scale is appropriate to the site's context and would not result in a detrimental impact on the quality of neighbour's amenity in terms of daylightlight/sunlight ingress or sense of overbearing.\r\rOverall, the proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision or privacy of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rThe application building is proposed to be extended and rationalised to increase the floor area, which includes reusing the original side 'closet' extension and extending the centre of the two buildings to accommodate a central shared staircase with a roof extension / dormer. A maisonette is proposed to the rear of the site, with high level windows and a flat roof design and front facing balcony.\r\rUnits 3 and 4 located on the first floor are pre-existing flats which are proposed to be improved to meet floorspace standards. A small rear extension at this level is proposed, which extends out to the existing rear building line. Additionally, new flank windows are proposed to align with the existing windows. The properties to the West are all in commercial use, and any views from the proposed window locations are primarily onto the flats roofs of the adjoining terrace.\r\rThe existing building is two storeys, including a room within the roof space. This shall be retained. The proposed addition to the site are considered to be modest in scale, no higher than the original ridge line and, therefore, not representing an overly dominant built form which would be viewed as overbearing. \r\rThe external appearance of the building is traditional in form and texture, with contemporary elements to its proposed detailing. External elevations are proposed to be matching London stock brick, which is considered to be robust and would be in keeping with the surrounding context. Window frames are shown to be matching painted timber. Painted gates and timber doors to the ground floor, with roof extensions to be finished in zinc cladding. The proposed materiality is considered to be positive representing a coherent overall design approach.\r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site has a public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 3 (Moderate).\r\rLondon Plan Policy T6 states \"Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). \r\rThe proposals would be car-free. A car-free scheme is acceptable, subject to a legal agreement to preclude future occupiers of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits. Subject to this agreement, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety. \r\rTable 10.2 of the London Plan (2021) sets a minimum cycle parking provision of 7no. cycle spaces for the proposed size of dwellings. \r\rA total of 8no. cycle parking spaces are proposed. Units 1 and 2 positioned on the ground floor would be provided with cycle storage with capacity for 2no. cycles accessed within the courtyard areas. Unit 5 would be provided with a dedicated secure cycle store accessed off Queens Road, with capacity for 2no. cycles. Cycle stands are shown to the front of the building on land within the applicant's ownership for a further 4no. cycles. \r\rOverall, this is considered to be acceptable, in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021. \r\rRefuse / Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rWhere containers need to be permanently stored to the front of a property, they should be housed in dedicated storage structures, which should be sited sensitively and where appropriate, well screened and appropriately landscaped so as to preserve and enhance the character of the street scene. In general, waste stores, typically containers, should not be sited to project forward of the established building line. A dedicated waste store should be constructed of materials appropriate to its context, particularly where the development site is in a sensitive location, for example a conservation area.\r\rRefuse and recycling arrangements for existing commercial operations remain unchanged by the proposals.\r\rWheelie bins will be stored in dedicated bin storage units to the flank of the building for both easy collection by operatives and use by occupants. This communal bin store is located on the ground floor plan. Unit 1 and 2 will keep bins in their private garden areas. Details of the bin enclosure would be secured by way of condition.\r\rSustainability\rPolicy DM3 of the Council's Core Strategy states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency, which would be dealt with via condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rContribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 3 with a charge of £85 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would accord with the relevant provisions set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5-year housing supply. The proposed development would provide 3no. net additional market housing units. The proposal would therefore make a small yet positive, contribution towards boosting housing delivery within the Borough. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe standard of accommodation in terms of the size and layout of the accommodation is found to be acceptable, providing good outlook and natural light to habitable rooms. Private amenity space is found to fall short of local space standards for one of the flats, but this is considered to be a minor divergence given that the unit in question is pre-existing (and the proposals are to increase the internal floor area to meet up-to-date minimum floorspace requirements), and also factor in the provision of amenity space in close proximity to the site. The private amenity areas serving the remaining flats would be relatively generously-sized either in line with or in excess of minimum standards. This matter is afforded significant weighting in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe proposed development would be car-free and the applicant has entered into a legal agreement to prevent the issue of on-street car parking permits in the event of a future CPZ. The proposed development would be provided with the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces and therefore adequately promotes sustainable modes of travel to future occupants of the development. This is afforded moderate weighting in favour of the proposals.\r\rThe development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area, as well as on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. These matters are both afforded neutral weighting in the overall assessment of the proposals, subject to conditions.\r\rMatters of sustainability and fire safety are considered to be neutral, subject to conditions.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the benefits of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits of the provision of three net additional dwellings in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\rAccordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted for the development.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
    "Please note that the subdivision of the dwelling into multiple units woudl require planning permission.",
    "Application Site\r\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. No particular designations or environmental constraints apply to the application site. \r\rProposal\r\rErection of first floor rear extension and alterations to side fenestration\r\rConsultation: No responses received to public notification. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire safety. \r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension would be part width and comprise a flat roof. This roof form would not follow the recommendations set out in Policy Guidance 34 (Two-storey Rear Extensions) which is regrettable, however, given that the proposal would not be highly visible in the street scene or appear visually dominant when viewed from private view points, the proposed development is not considered harmful to the character and appearance of the dwelling to warrant refusal of the scheme on this basis. In this instance, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The main properties to assess are Nos. 61 (attached semi-detached dwelling) and No. 65. The extension would be set in from the common boundary with No. 61 by at least 2.7m the submitted plans demonstrate that the proposed extension would not breach the '45 degree rule' in relation to the nearest habitable room window at No.61. With regards to No.65, according to previously approved plans for this dwelling, two of the three side facing ground floor windows serve a utility room and W.C. One window serves a kitchen, however this space is served by another rear facing window. Notwithstanding, due to the siting of the proposed extension, it is not considered that it would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The changes to fenestration would be at ground floor side only and involve the loss of a window and relocation of an existing which would not result in any adverse impacts to the amenities of the occupiers of No.65.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe following changes are proposed to the approved drawings:\r-\tIncrease in width of building by 1.3m \r-\tIncrease in FFL of 300mm\r-\tIncrease to eaves height of approximately 600mm\r-\tNew Entrance ramps and steps added. \r-\tAmendments to landscaping to accommodate increased size of building\r-\tAmendments to permeable paving (to comply with Condition no. 11)\r\rThe applicant has advised that a change in Manufacturer/Contractor resulted in the dimensions of the building being altered to suit their standard factory widths and depths. Owing to the costs associated with the excavation, the building now needs to be installed on a plinth. This results in the FFL being raised by approx. 300mm.  The new entrance ramp and steps now needs to be added to deal with the raised FFL.\r\rThe proposed changes would not increase the number of rooms (and classrooms) but would result in a significant increase to the size of the building which would appear significantly different and potentially give rise to issues in terms of character and appearance. \r\rThe additional ramps, steps and railings are modest additions and lightweight in appearance. \r\rThere will be a modest loss of soft landscaping, and associated new permeable paving, which is considered minor in the context of the approved consent and overall site.\r\rThe enlarged building extends further towards, and within the root protection area, of T5 a Category B Sycamore tree. The proposed building could therefore have a material impact on this tree, as advised by the Council's Tree Officer. Furthermore, through the parent permission, a compliance condition was secured for the submitted arboricultural details which would no longer be complied with. The enlarged building, and impact on this tree in particular, has not been considered through these details and so further assessment is required with an updated arboricultural report secured through any future planning permissions. \r\rThe interests of any third party or body who participated in or were informed of the original decision are not considered to be disadvantaged in any way.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are material and it is recommended that the application be refused. \r",
    "Whether or not a proposed amendment is considered to be non-material will depend on the circumstances of the case. There is no statutory definition of 'non material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. Whether or not a change can be considered as a \"non-material amendment\" may be defined according to established legal concepts of materiality and de minimis. The local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under section 96A. The local planning authority does not assess the acceptability of the proposed amendment but its magnitude.",
    "Application Site\rThe site is a Grade-II listed building and lies within the Surbiton Town Conservation Area and the Surbiton District Centre.\r\rHistoric England Listing Description: 1937, by Southern Railways Architects' Department under J R Scott. Reinforced concrete, painted. Flat roof. 4 bay central tall single storeyed booking hall, flanked by low, narrow bays containing kiosks, curving backwards to meet long, low wings. Continuous cantilevered canopy of concrete to centre and wings, with moulded edge. Clock tower to left with strong, but narrow cornice and horizontal strings to upper, set back part. Long square headed windows with narrow closely spaced mullions to booking hall. Original wood and bronze doors below, with triple bronze bars in front of long narrow windows. Central facia to canopy with \"Surbiton\" in sans serif capitals. Marble lined booking hall. Two long single storeyed buildings remain on platforms; also reinforced concrete, with rounded ends and horizontal glazing bars to windows. Built to contain offices, lavatories and waiting rooms.\r\rProposal\rListed Building Consent is sought for the installation of a wall-mounted automated external defibrillator (AED) unit in a high visibility robust cabinet, connected to a mains 240v supply and also incorporating a 120 - 240v AC powered heater and internal LED lighting.\r\rConsultations\rNeighbours consulted by way of an advert in the local press and notice and a site notice affixed in the vicinity of the application site. No representations received.\r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee - No objection.\r\rAssessment\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rParagraph 201 says that where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of) the significance of a designated heritage asset, permission should be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, or all of the following apply:\r\r- The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;\r- No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;\r- Conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and\r- The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.\r\rParagraph 202 goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. \r\rIn weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAccording to Paragraph 206, local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas and within the setting of heritage assets in order to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rIn October 1983 the station's historic and architectural interest and value was recognised, and it was Grade-II Listed by Historic England. Grade-II Listed Buildings are of special interest warranting every effort to preserve them.\r\rThe proposed works involve the installation of an external wall-mounted automated defibrillator (AED) unit for public use. The proposed unit will be sited in a high visibility robust cabinet connected to a mains 240V supply and incorporating a 120-140v AC powered heater and internal LED lighting. The proposed robust cabinet would measure 510 x 480 x 295 WxHxD (mm) externally and would be set between 1000-1350mm above ground level.\r\rHaving regard to the less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset that the proposed changes would result in, it is necessary, as per Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, to weigh this harm against the public benefits of the proposed scheme. \r\rThe public benefit of the proposed works would be the public use of emergency life-saving equipment.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in-keeping with the character and appearance of the area. The proposals would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the designated heritage asset. The public benefits in this instance are considered to outweigh the assessed harm, as per the requirements of Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021. As such, the proposals are considered to comply with the NPPF, 2021, the London Plan, 2021 and the LDF Core Strategy, 2012. \r",
