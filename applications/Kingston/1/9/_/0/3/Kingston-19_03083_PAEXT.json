    "The development complies with the criteria set out in Schedule 2, Part, 1 Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.\r\rThe application has been subject to a single objection from a neighbouring property. However, the objection relates to the construction process and not the impact of the development on the amenity of neighbours. Notwithstanding, officers have assessed the proposed development and have concluded that owing to the context of the site, the distance from boundaries, coupled with the scale and design of the proposed extension, that there would not be a detrimental impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties, such that a refusal would be in the public interest. \r\r\r",
    "Please provide a revised copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rPlease note that the submitted plan did not show the proposed work area hatched or shaded.\r"
