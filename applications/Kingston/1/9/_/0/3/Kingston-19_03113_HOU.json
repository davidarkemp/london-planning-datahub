    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The flat roof area(s) of the development to which this permission relates shall not be used as a roof garden, balcony, seating area or other similar amenity area, and shall not be accessed except for the purpose of maintenance or in the case of emergency.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development to which this permission relates shall be carried out in strict accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, in accordance with policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The application property is a three-storey terraced dwelling located on the west side of Guilford Avenue, which is a well-established residential area. The adjoining properties either side of the application unit have both been converted into flats and there are similar properties in the vicinity. The property does not have the benefit of off-street parking; and parking within Guilford Avenue is subject to a CPZ. The site is not located within a conservation area and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity.\r\rThe proposal is to convert the existing dwelling into four self-contained flats spread across the three floors of the property. The two ground floor flats will have access to their own garden space at the rear of the property, with the upper floor flats having a roof terrace for outdoor amenity space. The proposed flats will consist of 3 x one bedroom units and 1 x 2 bedroom unit. \r\rThere is no planning history that is relevant to this application. \r\r45 neighbouring properties were consulted on the application, with two letters of objection received. The planning issues raised in the responses are as follows:\r- Proposed ground floor extension will be higher and longer than the extension at no. 58 resulting in loss of light and poor outlook\r- The introduction of balconies are not a feature of neighbouring properties and result in overlooking issues\r\rOther consultations\rWaste & Recycling - No comments received\rDC & Cycle Parking - No comments received\rPolicy - No comments received\rClimate & Sustainability - No comments received\rStreet Name & Numbering - No comments received\rLead Local Flood Authority - No comments received\rTransport for London - No objection\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer - No comments received \r\rThe key planning considerations are:\r- The principle of development;\r- The character, appearance and quality of the proposed accommodation;\r- The proposed housing mix;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- The impact of the development on the transport network \r- Refuse and recycling\r- Legal agreement; and\r- Community Involvement Levy (CIL)\r",
    "The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development means that the planning system has three overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways:\r\ra. An economic objective - to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure;\r\rb. A social objective - to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities' health, social and cultural wellbeing; and\r\rc. An environmental objective - to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy.\r\rPlanning decisions should aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which, among other things, enable and support healthy lifestyles, especially where this would address identified local health and wellbeing needs. Local planning authorities should also take a positive approach to applications for alternative uses of land which is currently developed but not allocated for a specific purpose in plans, where this would help to meet identified development needs.\r\rThe proposal results in the addition of 2no. self-contained studio residential units (Use Class C3). It is recognised that Core Strategy Policy CS10 states that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing and goes onto state that new housing should be delivered in the most sustainable locations and that the preferred locations for\rnew housing include the three District Centres (Surbiton, Tolworth, New Malden). The NPPF recognises the Government's objective of significantly boosting the supply of homes and its policies strongly emphasise the need for local authorities to meet their objectively assessed needs for housing, which includes providing a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to meet five years' worth of required housing. This is something which the Council is currently unable to demonstrate.\r\rThe application site has a PTAL rating of 2, meaning that access to public transport is limited. The proposal would involve the conversion of an existing property, so use previously-developed land, and also make a contribution to the housing supply within the Borough within an area that is well-established for residential purposes. It is considered that these factors outweigh the PTAL rating, so the conversion of the property to provide additional living accommodation is deemed to be acceptable.",

    "Please provide a revised copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
