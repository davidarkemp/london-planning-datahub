    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended).",
    "Prior to the commencement of above ground works, until a Biodiversity Enhancement Strategy to enhance the nature conservation interest of the site has been submitted to and agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The Biodiversity Enhancement Strategy shall include the following details:\rBird boxes on trees (including location, specification and design)\rBat boxes suitable for pipistrelle (including location, specification and design)\rHedgehog links' (i.e. 15cm diameter gaps at the base of fences) \r\rThe development shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved and maintained as such thereafter.\r\rReason: To minimise the impact of the development on the ecological value of the area and to ensure the development provides the maximum possible provision towards the creation of habitats and valuable areas for biodiversity in accordance with Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM 6 of the Core Strategy (2021).",
    "The development shall strictly be carried out in accordance with the recommendations set out in Section 4 of the Bat Emergence and Return to Roost Survey (by James Blake Associates, June 2020)\r\rReason: In order to prevent any harm to bats in accordance with the  Wildlife and Countryside Act, 1981 (as amended), National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policy DM6 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Full details of the lighting across the site shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the occupation of the development hereby approved. \r\rThe details shall include the location and full specification of: all lamps; light levels/spill lamps, support structures, hours of operation and technical details on how impacts on bat foraging will be minimised. The lighting measures shall be carried out strictly in accordance with the details so approved, shall be installed prior to the occupation of the development and shall be maintained as such thereafter. \r\rReason: To ensure that any resulting general or security lighting is appropriately located, designed to not adversely impact neighbouring residential amenity as well as protecting the biodiversity value of the site in accordance with Policy G6 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Notwithstanding the details approved, the design and installation of any new items of fixed plant shall be such that when operating the cumulative noise level LAeq Tr arising from the proposed plant, measured or predicted at 1m from the facade of the nearest noise sensitive premises, shall be a rating level of at least 5dB(A) below the background noise level LAF90 Tbg. The measurement and/or prediction of the noise should be carried out in accordance with the methodology contained within BS 4142: 2014. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed facilities including cafe, cinema and hairdressers shall only be used by the residents of the care home and their visitors and not for general use by members of the public. \r\rReason: In the interests of residential amenity and the highway network in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy.",
    "Prior to commencement of development, an air quality assessment report, in accordance with current guidance, for the existing site and proposed development shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority. The report shall include an assessment of construction dust impacts.\r\rThe development shall be at least \"Air Quality Neutral\" and an air quality neutral assessment for both building and transport shall be included in the report.\r\rThe assessment shall have regard to the most recent air quality predictions and monitoring results from the Authority's Review and Assessment process, the London Air Quality Network and the London Atmospheric Emissions Inventory.  The report shall include all calculations and baseline data, and be set out so that the Local Planning Authority can fully audit the report and critically analyse the content and recommendations.\r\rA scheme for air pollution mitigation measures based on the findings of the report shall be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority prior to commencement of development. This shall include mitigation for when air quality neutral transport and building assessments do not meet the benchmarks.\r\rThe approved mitigation scheme shall be implemented in its entirety in accordance with the details approved under this condition before any of the development is first occupied or the use commences and retained as such thereafter.\r\rReason: To protect environmental health and local amenity.  To comply with the London Plan and its Sustainable Design and Construction SPG. To ensure compliance with Policy SI1 of the London Plan 2021 in relation to air quality neutrality.",
    "Prior to commencement of development a piling method statement shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. Any piling must be undertaken in accordance with the terms of the approved piling method.\r\rThe piling method statement shall detail the type of piling to be undertaken, why this method has been selected, measures to be taken to minimise noise and vibration and a plan showing where the piles are to be installed. There are a number of different piling methods suitable for different circumstances. Guidance is contained in BS5228 Noise control on Construction and Open sites - Part 4: Code of Practice for noise and vibration control applicable to piling operations. The contractor is required to take the best practicable means to minimise noise and vibration and the Council positively encourages the use of hydraulic, auger and diaphragm wall piling methods. Where complaints of noise and vibration are received it is expected that the contractor will undertake noise and vibration monitoring, with data reported back to the Environmental Health Service.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and to safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "An acoustic report shall be submitted demonstrating that the rating level of the noise from the kitchen extract system shall be at least 5dBA lower than the existing background noise level at any given time of operation.  The noise levels shall be measured or predicted 1m externally to any window at the nearest residential facade.  Measurements and assessment shall be made according to British Standard 4142:2014\r Full details, with calculations, of the proposed extraction system shall be submitted to demonstrate compliance with \"Control of Odour and Noise from Commercial Kitchen Exhaust Systems\" published by EMAQ+ dated September 2018. This replaced the previous Defra guidance, now withdrawn.\r The submission shall include, where applicable, details of:\r(i) The extract fan, silencers, anti-vibration mounts, high velocity cowl, filters, odour abatement and any other items of plant;\r(ii) The velocity of the air at final discharge and duct termination height and location\r(iii) The retention time of gases in the carbon filters (where applicable);\r(iv) A maintenance schedule\r(v) Completion of an odour risk assessment\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenity of neighbouring residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the glazing related to the stairwells on the eastern elevation and in closest proximity to No. 21 Coombe Lane West shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r11 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of single storey rear extension and shed and erection of single storey rear/side extension. \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises  semi detached dwelling .\r\rThe application site resides within Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character.\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Flood Risk \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks demolition of single storey rear extension and shed and erection of single storey rear/side extension. \r\rThe proposal extension would extend a maximum depth of 6.68m beyond the rear elevation of the original house. It would be irregular in shape  with a  minimum width of 5.4m close to the original house widening on to a maximum of 6.135m . The separation distance between the proposed side elevation (north) and  shared boundary fence would range from minimum 0.920m to 1.050m.\r\r The proposed roof arrangement  for the side extension would be a single aspect pitched slate tiled roof with an eaves height of 2.304m and maximum pitch height  of 3m and would wraparound to the rear elevation where it presents a part hipped part flat crown type roof arrangements where the proposed eaves height would be 2.385m and flat roof height  3.5m.  An overhang of the roof  is presented on the proposed rear elevation . A new parapet wall is proposed between nos 53 and neighbouring no51 to extend the length of the proposed extension. The proposed materials would relate well to the existing property. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear/ side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 195 to 208 of the NPPF (December 2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application site falls within  Grove Lane  Local Area of Special Character,  a non designated heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would  not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would harm the significance of the   Grove Lane Local Area of Special Character. \r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficers note that  the applicant has submitted a  Flood Risk pro - forma and together with the submitted drawings has  shown the finished floor level would be no lower than existing levels . Whilst no details have been provided  in terms  of specific mitigation measures  to be implemented as recommended in the EA Standing Advice  to be implemented , Officers consider it appropriate, in the event of an approval,  to impose a condition  for such details to be submitted  and approved by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r8no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.\r \rKingston and North Kingston Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - Objection unless revised . Although this represents and improvement  on the previous refused PA (24/00194), increasing by 500mm the ridge height of the existing hip roof design to the front elevation eg increasing the height of the eaves by a similar amount produced an unsatisfactory  result - in our view the roof would be out of proportion to the rest of the property and its neighbours and therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the CA. In addition the rooflight proposed have not been specified as conservation grade. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for alterations to roof with ridge raised 500mm and rear hip to gable roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Installation of side rooflights and alterations to fenestration \r\rPlanning History \r24/00194/HOU -  Constructing a new roof with a ridge raised 500mm to facilitate a loft conversion.

Granted 22.08.17\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe application site is  located within Richmond Road Conservation Area. \r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are: \r- Character and Appearance;\r- The impact upon residential amenity;\r- Impact on Heritage Assets\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : \rOfficers note the applicant has revisited the proposal following the refusal of an earlier application ( ref :24/00194/HOU ) and have addressed a number of the design issues that were set out in the Officers Report . \r\rOfficers note that the application site has been the subject of numerous planning approvals for various alterations. The scope of proposed works subject to this application   are alterations to roof with ridge raised 500mm and rear hip to gable roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Installation of side rooflights and alterations to fenestration. \r\rIt is noted that the raising of the ridge by 500mmm would not exceed the existing ridge height of neighbouring 19 St Albans Road  yet it would significantly alter the character, appearance and design quality of the dwelling bulk and massing to the existing dwelling. However,  it is considered this is counterbalanced  in design terms with the   retention of the existing front hipped roof arrangement  and its contribution to the streetscene. \r\rThe previous proposal sought a render finish to the front elevation and window surrounds which was not supported. These design features have been removed and the  revised proposal seeks the retention of the facing brickwork of the original dwelling  which is deemed acceptable in the context of the dwellings  and their contribution to the existing streetscene. Other design features which would be acceptable are the proposed aluminium windows and the proposed grey roof tiles. \r\rOfficers note that rooflights have in more recent years become an additional feature on the roofslopes on dwellings along St Albans Road .  In response to the previous refusal, the applicant has revised the proposed rooflight arrangement  reducing the quantum from 9 to 7 and spaced them to avoid a cluttered look.  To ensure the  proposed rooflights are appropriate for a conservation area setting, Officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition for  'conservation style' rooflights to be installed  to be flush with the roof and for details to be  submitted to the Local Planning Authority for review and approval . \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the scope of the proposed works, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rAs the planning history demonstrates, the application site has been subject to multiple planning approval for alterations to the dwelling.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 195 - 208 of the NPPF (2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets (including non-designated heritage assets). Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe site is located within the Richmond Road Conservation Area. a designated heritage asset and has a neutral contribution to the significance of  the Conservation Area. The revised proposals  of raising the ridge height, replacement windows and doors together with introduction of the side roof lights are considered acceptable and would have a neutral impact on the significance of the Richmond Road Conservation Area . To ensure the proposed replacement windows and doors and rear juliet balcony railings are appropriate for a conservation area setting , Officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition for further details  on these  design features to be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for review and approval . \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r\r\r",

    "Please provide existing plan and elevations of the metal storage to be demolished",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling situated on a corner plot location where Walpole Road and Upper Brighton Road meet. The entire application site is covered by an Area Tree Preservation Order (TPO) and falls within the Oakhill Local Area of Special Character (a non-designated heritage asset). The significance of this part of the LASC derives primarily from the attractive detached Edwardian houses and the mature gardens, trees and shrubs.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and creation of new basement level.\r\rOfficer Note: It is noted a large raised platform of c. 0.5m in height above ground level has been shown on the submitted drawings, however, the raised platform has not been included in the description of development and will therefore not be considered as part of the assessment of this planning application.\r\rConsultation\rTree & Landscape Officer - Object \r\rFlood Risk & Drainage Officer - Object\r\rEnvironmental Health Officer - No objection\r\rHeritage and Conservation Lead - No objection\r\rRepresentations\r6 neighbouring properties were notified of the planning application. In response to this notification 1 letter of objection was received making the following comments:\r- Overly dominant apperarance;\r- Loss of daylight;\r- The proposed felling of T9, a significant tree, is unacceptable as it appears to be healthy and mature and offers many benefits;\r- Loss of privacy from the proposed new extension;\r- Disruption resuling from building works;\r\rOfficer Note: Disturbance during development and the loss of views are not material planning considerations. The material planning considerations raised in the letter of objection will be addressed in the report below.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Character, design and impact on non-designated heritage assets\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings;\r- Impact on trees;\r- Flood risk and drainage; and,\r- Fire safety.\r\rCharacter, design and impact on non-designated heritage assets\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. Features of local importance must be respected and preserve or enhance the established character of heritage assets.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would have a contemporary appearance utilising copper cladding, a copper window frame and copper coping. The proposed materials are considered to be of a high quality and it is considered that the design would relate well to the more recent addition to the application property which has a contemporary appearance. The proposed basement would not be visible above ground level. Overall, it is considered that the proposed buildings would, in isolation, be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rThe impact of the removal of 'T9' on the character of the area is considered further in the 'Impact on Trees' section below.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The concerns raised by the neighbouring property are noted. The proposed single storey rear and basement extension would not result in any direct loss of privacy to habitable room windows at No. 4 Walpole Road (ref: 18/00194/FUL) with the only rear facing window in the extension serving a stairway to the basement.  \r\rHowever, views over the rear garden of No. 4 Walpole Road would be possible from the proposed bedroom window in the chamfered elevation of the extension. Given the proximity of the proposed window to the boundary, its orientation towards the small rear garden of No. 4 and the proposed removal of the mature Yew Tree 'T9' it is considered that there would be an unacceptable loss of privacy to the private amenity space of No. 4. While new boundary treatment and replacement planting could partially mitigate the identified loss of privacy, mitigation measures such as higher fencing could in turn result in an overbearing impact and undue sense of enclosure.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of any other neighbouring properties.\r\rImpact on Trees\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) states that the Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of  the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\r\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan (2021) states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained (Category A, B and lesser category trees where these are considered by the local planning authority to be of importance to amenity and biodiversity, as defined by BS 5837:2012).\r\rThe Council's Tree & Landscape Officer has reviewed the submitted Arboricultural Information and proposals and objects to the removal of 'T9' as the Yew tree is of good quality and has high amenity value. It can be seen from Walpole Road and is also providing screening for the neighbouring properties. The proposed development would therefore result in the loss of a protected tree which is important to the character of the area (which includes the Oakhill Local Area of Special Character) and which provides screening to neighbouring properties.\r\rFlood Risk & Drainage\rPolicy D11(C) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that development proposals should maximise building resilience and minimise potential physical risks, including those arising as a result of extreme weather, fire, flood and related hazards.\r\rThe Council's Flood Risk & Drainage Officer has reviewed the proposals and raises a number of concerns in relation to the submitted Basement Construction Method Statement as it fails to demonstrate that the proposed basement would be appropriately flood resilient (contrary to paragraph 173b of the NPPF). Accordingly, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed development would be appropriately resilient and would not constitute a safety risk in a flood event.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
