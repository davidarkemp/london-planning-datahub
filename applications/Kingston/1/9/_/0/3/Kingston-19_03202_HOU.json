    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The materials and finishes of the external walls of the development hereby permitted shall match in colour and texture those of the existing building, or such other materials as shall have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall thereafter be retained as such. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The accommodation hereby permitted shall be occupied solely for purposes incidental to the occupation and enjoyment of the application property as a single dwelling and shall not be used as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: The establishment of an additional independent unit of accommodation would give rise to an over-intensive use of the site and lead to an unsatisfactory relationship between independent dwellings.",
