    "The proposed extension, by reason of its scale and position forward of the established Coombe Lane West building line, would disrupt the existing pattern and grain of development and result in a discordant and jarring feature in the street scene. The proposal is therefore, contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "Please be advised that the fee catergory you have picked would not apply to this type of application. The catergory would be G and the fee would be Â£750"
