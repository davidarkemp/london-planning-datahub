    "Should there be a requirement to make alterations to vehicular access(s). Applicants should note the provisions of section 184 of the Highways Act 1980. The works should be to the specification and constructed to the satisfaction of the Council, and you will be required to pay fees to cover the Council's costs in undertaking the approval and inspection of the works.",
    "Should the access into the site during construction not be paved, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads.We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.",
    "Please be advised that the submitted application form is not readable and we are unable to open it. Please can you email this to us again so that we can be sure this is not an issue on our part, as we have tried to open this document without success",
    "Please can you submit a full set of your existing and proposed site plans, block plans, floor plans and elevations.\r\rLooking at the submitted Existing Site Plans (097/EX/002) and Existing Block Plans (097/EX/004) - both at the same scale, the site plan shows no extensions whereas the Block Plan does. Looking at the 2 sets of Block Plans you have submitted (097/PR/204) there is some confusion here. All previous plans will be superceded and we ask that you submit a full new set of plans, taking into account the points raised."
