    "The erection of single storey rear extension and rear dormer roof extension, installation of 3x front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors. \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r\rBy indicating that the development proposal conflicts with relevant planning policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site comprises a two-storey semi-detached dwelling situated on the north-east side of Surbiton Road. The site is located within Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) A/A1 - Kingston Town Centre. The site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 3/5 as it is divided between two separate PTAL zones.\r\rRelevant History\r\rNo. 87A Surbiton Road - 20/03355/FUL - Erection of double storey rear extension (following demolition of existing extension) with associated loft conversion and addition of 3 no. rooflights to front roofslope, with new end gables, to convert existing single family dwellinghouse into 3 no. self-contained flats (2 x three-bedroom and 1 x two-bedroom) with associated parking, refuse/recycling storage and cycle parking facilities - Pending Consideration\r\r11/12266/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension and conversion of garage to habitable room - Permitted 27.07.2011\rProposal\r\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of double storey rear extension (following demolition of existing extension) with associated loft conversion and addition of 3 no. rooflights to front roofslope, with new end gables, to convert existing single family dwellinghouse into 3 no. self-contained flats (2 x three-bedroom and 1 x two-bedroom) with associated parking, refuse/recycling storage and cycle parking facilities\r\rPrinciple of Development\r\rThe proposed development would result in the loss of an existing dwellinghouse capable of occupation by a family. However, the proposal would provide 2x 3 bedroom dwellings which could be occupied by a family. On this basis it is not considered that there would be a conflict with Policy DM14 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe Council cannot demonstrate a 5 year supply of housing land as required by the NPPF 2019, the policies which are most important for determining the application are therefore considered out of date and the tests set out in paragraph 11d must be applied (tilted balance). These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of this planning application.\rThe proposed development would provide 3 market dwellings (a net increase of 2 dwellings) at a time when the Council is unable to demonstrate a 5 year housing land supply. Subject to the detailed assessment of all other material planning considerations, the proposed residential development, if approved, would assist in meeting the Borough's annual housing target.\r\rCharacter and Design\r\rThe proposed development would comprise alterations to the roof to convert the existing hipped roof into a Dutch gable type roof (part hipped/part gable). The existing single storey rear extension would be removed and replaced with a two-storey rear extension of 6m in depth along the shared boundary with adjoining No. 87A Surbiton Road (as shown on the submitted Floor Plans; it is noted that the Proposed Elevations appear to show a set-back of approximately 0.4m which conflicts with the Floor Plans). The two-storey rear extension would have a gable roof of a maximum height of 8.7m and an eaves height of 5.7m.\r\rThe proposed roof form does not relate well to the hipped roof form of the existing property and is not characteristic of properties in the wider area. The proposed roof alterations would disrupt the symmetry shared with adjoining No. 87A and would be a discordant feature within the street scene. It is noted that there is a planning application for a similar form of development at No. 87A, however, no mechanism has been provided to ensure that both developments would be delivered concurrently, were planning permission to be granted for both developments.\r\rThe two-storey rear extension would not be a proportionate or subordinate feature to the existing dwelling, however, it would not be highly prominent within the street scene. Officers therefore consider that, on balance, no significant harm would result to the character or appearance of the existing area from the proposed two-storey rear extension.\r\rIt has been indicated in the submission that 3 on-site car parking spaces would be provided, although the proposed car parking spaces are not shown on any of the submitted drawings. The provision of 3 on-site car parking spaces, waste and recycling storage and a secure cycle store to the front of the property could detract from the character and appearance of the street scene, although insufficient information has been submitted to fully assess this.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed roof alterations would unbalance the symmetry shared between the application site and the adjoining semi-detached property and would result in a discordant and overly dominant form of development within the street scene, contrary to the NPPF (2019), Policies D3 and D4 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rImpact on Residential Amenity\r\rIt is noted that a planning application has been submitted for the adjoining property, however, this has not yet been determined and there is no mechanism to ensure that it would be delivered in the event of a planning approval. The degree of weight which can be given to this neighbouring planning application is therefore limited.\r\rThe proposed two-storey rear extension would appear to be built hard up to the shared boundary with No. 87A to a depth of 6m and an eaves height of approximately 5.7m. The proposal would fail the BRE 45 degree rule on both plan form and elevation in relation to the ground floor living room window at No. 87A (ref: 09/12091/FUL) indicating that there would be a significant loss of daylight. The presence of such a bulky extension hard up to the boundary at the two-storey level would have an overbearing appearance and would result in an undue sense of enclosure to habitable rooms at adjoining No. 87A.\r\rWith reference to flats to the north at Lansdowne House, the separation distance and position of habitable room windows at Lansdowne House is such that there would not be any significant adverse impact on the amenities of residents. With reference to properties to the rear along Fassett Road, the separation distances between habitable room windows would accord with the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD (2013) and is therefore considered to be acceptable.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\r\rThe proposed flats would accord with the relevant minimum space standards set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021). While habitable rooms would have relatively large floor plates, the proposed flats would each benefit from multiple aspects. However, the ground floor layout and position of windows is such that the ground floor unit would appear to have little defensible space or privacy due to the positioning of habitable room windows onto the communal access to the rear garden.\r\rIn terms of private and communal amenity space, it is stated on the submitted Cover Letter that the rear garden would be subdivided to provide amenity space for each flat, however, no details of this has been shown on the submitted drawings. Officers cannot therefore conclude that a sufficient quantity and quality of private and communal amenity space would be provided for the proposed dwellings.\r\rOverall, the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed dwellings would have access to private and communal amenity space of a high quality and the proposed ground floor flat would not benefit from sufficient levels of privacy. The proposed flats would therefore be of a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rParking & Highway Safety\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rTable 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum car parking provision in Outer London areas with a PTAL 2-3 of up to 1 space per 3 bedroom unit and up to 0.75 space per 1-2 bedroom unit. Development within a PTAL 5 area should be car free, with the exception of disabled car parking provision.\r\rIt has been indicated in the submitted Covering Letter and application form that 3 on-site car parking spaces are proposed, however, no details of this are shown on the submitted drawings and it is unclear whether cars would be able to access/egress the site in a forward gear. It has been indicated that the applicant would be willing to enter into a legal agreement to restrict residents from applying for on-street car parking permits, however, no completed undertaking has been submitted.\r\rThe site is divided between PTAL Zones 3 and 5. Due to the sustainable location of the site in close proximity to amenities at Surbiton Road Local Centre, excellent public transport links and strategic walking and cycling networks in the immediate vicinity it is considered that minimal on-site car parking should be provided, in accordance with Policy T6 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rIn terms of cycle parking, it is considered that there would be sufficient space within the site to provide at least the minimum 6 on-site cycle parking spaces required by Table 10.2 of Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021). Details of cycle parking would be required by way of a planning condition were the application to be recommended for approval.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would discourage sustainable modes of transport through the relative overprovision of on-site car parking spaces in what is a sustainable and accessible location. Furthermore, insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that vehicles would be able to access and egress the site, for the purposes of utilising the 3 on-site car parking spaces, in a forward gear which could pose highway safety issues. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policies T6, T6.1 of the London Plan (2021), Policy DM 9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the NPPF (2019).\r\rPlanning Balance\r\rThe proposed development would provide 2 additional dwellings on a previously developed site at a time when the Council is unable to demonstrate a deliverable supply of five years' worth of housing land supply. This carries substantial weight in favour of the proposal. \r\rThe proposed accommodation would be of a poor standard with a lack of defensible space and privacy for the proposed ground floor unit and it has not been demonstrated that each of the proposed units would have private amenity space of a suitable size and quality and no communal amenity space would be provided. This carries moderate weight against the proposal.\r\rThe proposed development would fail to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport through a relative over-provision of on-site car parking in what is a sustainable and accessible location in close proximity to amenities. Furthermore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed on-site car parking would be independently accessible and that vehicles could access and egress the site in a forward gear which could harm highway safety. This carries significant weight against the proposal.\r\rThe proposed roof alterations would disrupt the symmetry shared between the application site and the adjoining semi-detached property and would result in a discordant and overly dominant form of development within the street scene. This would carry substantial weight against the proposal.\r\rThe proposed two-storey rear extension would result in a significant loss of daylight, would have an overbearing impact and would result in an undue sense of enclosure to habitable room windows at adjoining No. 87A Surbiton Road. This would carry significant weight against the proposal.\r\rIn this case, Officers consider that the disbenefits associated with the scheme which relate to: the incongruous design and form of development, significant adverse impact on residential amenity, the poor standard of accommodation, potential harm to highway safety and failure to encourage the use of sustainable modes of transport, would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of providing an additional 2 dwellings on the site when assessed against the policies in the NPPF (2019) as a whole.\rAs such, Officers conclude that the proposed development would be in conflict with the Development Plan and that the planning application should be refused.\r",
