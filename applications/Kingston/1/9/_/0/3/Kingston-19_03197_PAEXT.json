    "The proposed single storey rear extension falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule  2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a fire station and ancillary outbuildings.\r\rThe application seeks the following:\r- Replacement of windows and doors (on all blocks);\r- Replacement of roof coverings (on all blocks);\r- Single-storey in-fill extension, between blocks and B1 and C1 (maximum height 3.27m);\r- Block B1 - Increase maximum height (from 3m to 3.27m) to facilitate change in roof from pitched to flat and new roof insulation;\r- Block C1 - Increase maximum height (from 3.02m to 3.27m) to facilitate new roof insulation;\r- New cat and ship ladders, on rear elevation of main station building; and,\r- New guard railings/edge protection on main station building roof.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rConsultations:\rSurbiton Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No response received.\rRBK Highways and Transportation Department - No objection.\r\r69 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy requires proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rParagraph 197 of the NPPF states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The site is located within the Oakhill Conservation Area (A) and the main station building is locally listed. The significance of the conservation area relates to a Regency and early Victorian linear housing development, with the area around Ewell Road later being converted to a commercial centre, together with an area of substantial Victorian houses and The Wood open space to the west.\r\rThe proposed replacement roof coverings, the works to blocks B1 and C1 (including the infill extension) and the new cat and ship ladders would not have any significant impact on either the character and appearance of the area or on the historic fabric of the main station building. However, the new guard railing to the main building would result in a notable change to its appearance and the proposed replacement windows would involve the loss of some timber-framed sash windows at ground floor level in the main building.\r\rGiven that the significance of the conservation area is derived from its status as a Regency and early Victorian housing development, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in harm to the significance of the conservation area, despite changing the appearance of the main building. The proposal would not affect the ability to appreciate the historic significance of the area and would not otherwise be detrimental to its character and appearance. \r\rHowever, officers conclude that the proposal would result in harm to the significance of the locally listed building through the loss of the timber sash windows and the introduction of guard railings, both of which are inconsistent with the original design of the building. This harm will be considered further in the conclusion of this report.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the scale and siting of the proposed new built from, the proposal would not appear overbearing or result in any materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. The alterations to the windows would not give rise to any new views over neighbouring properties and so would not result in any loss of privacy. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, officers consider that the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the Oakhill Conservation Area and would not result in any harm to its significance. However, it would result in harm to the significance of the locally listed main station building by reason of the proposed window frame materials and guard railings to the roof, which must be taken into account in determining the application. Officers consider the extent of harm to be limited, relating only to the introduction and addition of features which are inconsistent with the original design of the building, rather than fundamental alterations to its appearance or the loss of important parts of the historic fabric of the building. \r\rBalanced against this harm are the benefits of the proposal. The London Fire Brigade provide an emergency service and the benefits of this service to the public are self-evident. The station building is essential to providing this service in the local area and the proposal would help ensure the building is fit for purpose by facilitating its maintenance, as well as helping to ensure the safety and security of those using the building. Having regard to these considerations, officers consider that the limited harm to the locally listed building is, on balance, acceptable.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, and the Policies of the Core Strategy (2012).",
