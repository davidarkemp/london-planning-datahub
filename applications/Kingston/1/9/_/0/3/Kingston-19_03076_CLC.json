    "The details submitted for Condition 4 Part 8 (New Roof for Lambeth Coal Store) of Listed Building Consent 19/01212/LBC by the applicant are considered satisfactory and this condition is hereby fully discharged.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 20/02596/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the first floor side extension, which would have resulted in a terracing effect. The first floor side extension has been removed from the current proposal thereby addressing this issue. \r\rThe current application proposes a hip-to-gable conversion, and while this would not respect the symmetry of the adjoining property as recommended by the Residential Design Guide SPD, officers note there are examples of similar developments on the streetscene. As such the proposed hip-to-gable conversion would not appear an incongruous addition to the Endway streetscene. \r\rThe proposed front porch infill extension would extend to a relatively modest depth, however it is unclear as to what the roof form would be. While the submitted proposed elevation plans show a hipped roof form, the proposed floor plans show a flat roof form. Therefore, while the depth is considered acceptable, officers note that it is not possible to assess the impact that the proposed porch infill extension would have on the Endway streetscene.\r\rOfficers note that similar inconsistencies are found with the dimensions on the proposed single storey rear and side extension. While the submitted proposed ground floor plan shows that the depth of the rear extension would be just over 4m in depth, the proposed side elevation shows a rear extension with a depth of around 3m. Further inconsistencies are also shown on the plans in regard to the height and roof form of the proposed rear and side elevation. While the proposed side elevation plan shows a part parapet roof and flat roof, the proposed floor plans and rear elevation shows a pitched roof. \r\rTherefore, given the inconsistencies shown within the plans provided, officers cannot fully assess whether the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. Officers cannot therefore conclude that the proposed development would not have any unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above, the plans provided do not accurately show the proposed depth of the rear extension. Given that the height and roof form of the proposed rear/side extension is also unclear, officers cannot accurately assess the impact the proposed rear and side extension would have to the amenities of the neighbouring properties. Furthermore, given that a proposed west side elevation has not been provided it is unclear what specific effect the rear extension would have to neighbouring property No.28 Endway.\r\rTherefore, due to the fact that there are numerous inconsistencies with the plans provided, it cannot be determined that the proposed development would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of the adjoining neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, given the inconsistencies of the plans provided, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rTherefore it is recommended that this proposal be refused.",
    "Please provide revise copies of proposed elevation C at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\rThe Proposed Elevation C is labelled as Existing Elevation C in the submitted drawing."
