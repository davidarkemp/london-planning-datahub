    "The development permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years of Planning Permission Reference: 19/00988/HOU, dated 05/06/2019.\r\rReason: In order to comply with the provisions of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended). \r",
    "Development shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached linked dwelling and has retained its original catslide roof.\r\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on the highways and transport\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note a similar permission has been granted at No. 5 Appleton Gardens (20/01889/HOU granted 01.10.2020).  In this case the proposed 2 storey rear extension would be set back from the front elevation. The proposed roof form would relate well to the main roof and would be set down from that of the original house, in accordance with Policy Guidance 36. It is considered that the proposed extensions would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed porch to the side, would be set back approx. 2.8m from the front elevation. The proposed roof form and materials would be in-keeping with the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed development would be clearly visible from the street. Although, given that the extensions would be set back from the front elevation and would appear subordinate in relation to the host dwelling with separation gaps to neighbouring boundaries clearly maintained, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an adverse impact on the existing street scene and would not unbalance the adjoining, linked property. It is noted that the existing street scene has examples of two storey extensions with the cat-slide roof retained with a side dormer, similar to the proposed development.\r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given its siting and the separation distances from neighbouring boundaries, it is considered that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight, sunlight. The proposed openings to the side of the porch would not have any undue impact on neighbouring property, of No. 3, as they would face the entrance and hall. However, the proposed windows at first floor level should be finished in obscured glazing and this would be secured by condition should permission be granted.\r\rOverall and subject to the condition outlined above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage and one off-street car parking space on site, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 3 off street car parking spaces. As such, there would be no adverse impact upon highway safety, on-street car parking provision or neighbouring amenity as part of the proposals, therefore the proposal would comply with Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Cosre Strategy.  Whilst it is acknowledged that the remaining car parking provision would be in excess of the maximum standards set out in Policy T6.1 of the London Plan, it is considered that it would be unreasonable for this to form grounds for refusal, given the existing situation. Access to the rear garden is maintained so safe and secure storage for cycles could still be provided within the garden in compliance with Policy T5 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a single dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.
