    "The development has failed to incorporate a mix of unit sizes to meet the identified housing needs of the Borough. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the delivery of 30% of the units as family units would be unsuitable or unviable. As such, the development is contrary to Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the lack of off-street car parking spaces to serve the development would not give rise to an unacceptable increase in pressure for on-street car parking spaces in the area, leading to inconsiderate parking and undue inconvenience for other road users. The proposed development therefore, conflicts with policy CS7 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application property relates to the ground floor flat, of a two storey semi detached building. There is an existing shed to the rear and a substantial rear garden. \r\rProposal\rThe application is for the erection of single storey side and rear extension with associated changes to fenestration (side elevation). The extension has been designed to create an additional (second) bedroom within the existing kitchen space and to form a new kitchen/dining area. The existing garden shed would also be replaced.\r\r\rConsultation\r\r15 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed side extension would measure 4.6m from the existing rear wall to match the depth of the existing side return. The proposed rear extension would continue an additional 1.5m, with a 1.1m setback from the boundary with Nos 42 & 44 Vale Crescent, but to the boundary with Nos 50 & 52 Vale Crescent. \r\rBoth extensions would be 3.15m in height (inclusive of the parapet).  \r\rThe existing shed would be replaced in the same location but reduced in size.\r\rAn existing door on the side (northern) elevation would be replaced with a window, and an additional window and door would be incorporated into the rear elevation. \r\rLocated on the boundary, the proposed side extension (4.6m deep) exceeds the maximum depth of 3.5m recommended in the SPD guidance (PG13) for rear extensions, and would project well beyond the established building line of the adjoining property. This is further exacerbated by the side extension which would then project beyond the proposed side extension.\r\rThe proposed use of black treated vertical timber cladding and basket weave brick bond to external walls are also inconsistent with the external treatment of existing and surrounding buildings, further compromising the character and appearance of the area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is not considered  acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design, and would result in unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area in this specific regard.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed development would be located directly on the boundary shared with No.42 Vale Crescent which does not have a rear extension in this location, but has a large bay window to a habitable room which would be directly affected by the extension in terms of outlook, daylight/sunlight and an unwanted sense of enclosure. \r\rThe impact of the windows proposed to the northern elevation also give rise to concerns given the lack of information provided in relation to the property at No.50 Vale Crescent\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have a very limited impact upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of overbearing appearance, daylight/sunlight and privacy.\r",

This is further exacerbated by the side extension which would then project beyond the proposed side extension.\r\rThe proposed style and size of the windows and the use of black treated vertical timber cladding and basket weave brick bond to external walls are also inconsistent with the external treatment of the host property and surrounding buildings.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered  unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design, and would result in unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area in this specific regard.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed development would be located directly on the boundary shared with No.42 Vale Crescent which does not have a rear extension in this location, but has a large bay window to a habitable room which would be directly affected by the extension.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the excessive depth and height of the proposed extension, combined with its siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to adjoining property, No. 42 Vale Crescent. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor principal habitable room at No. 42 Vale Crescent. \r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and neighbouring residential amenity. Officers therefore consider the proposal to be contrary to  the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be approved, officers conclude that planning permission be REFUSED.\r",
