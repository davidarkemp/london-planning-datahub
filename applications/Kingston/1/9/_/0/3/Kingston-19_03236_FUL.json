Application Granted on 15 Mar 2012\r\rConsultations\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and two representations were received OBJECTING to the application on the grounds of:\r\rAccess issues during construction.\r\rThe two objections received in relation to this application both raise concerns regarding access to the site during the construction period of the proposed development, using a private access road/path to the rear of the site that the owner of the application site does not have permission to use. No evidence has been submitted to substantiate these claims, and in any event this would be a civil matter for the applicant to address with neighbours if indeed access was not available.  Notwithstanding, Insofar as this might be material to this application it is given limited weight. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey outbuilding to the rear of the site, with a below level store room. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed outbuilding would be built on the boundary with the neighbouring properties at No. 111 Durlston Road. Whilst the proposed development may cause some level of overshadowing of No. 111's rear garden it would not adversely impact any principal habitable room windows to an unacceptable degree. It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of light, overbearing appearance or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

Granted planning permission, July 2006.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a two-storey extension to create 2no. one-bedroom self-contained flats with associated landscaping, amenity space, cycle stores and refuse/recycling facilities. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the western side of Leatherhead Road, Chessington. The site is occupied by a two-storey property fronting Leatherhead Road with a relatively long, rectangular-shaped rear garden, with vehicular access obtained from Sienna Close.\r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutory or locally listed.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- The principle of the development;\r-  The standard of accommodation;\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Transportation and Highways;\r- Refuse and recycling;\r- Sustainability; and \r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impacts, as required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF.\r\rThe site is in an established residential area and its use for residential purposes is well established. The principle of creating new residential units within an established residential area is acceptable, subject to compliance with Development Plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the proposed dwellings to be 1bedroom, 2person size. \r\rAccording to the standards, dwellings of this size arranged over one storey should have a minimum GIA of 50sqm. Both of the proposed dwellings would be below the minimum space standards, providing a total floor area of approximately 42sqm.\r \rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for storage is 1.5sqm. The proposed dwellings do not indicate any built in storage.\r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\r\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rThe proposed double bedroom in each flat would be compliant with these space standards, with each bedroom measuring to 11.7sqm (double). \r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5 and 2.6m. This would be in compliance with standards set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed units would be dual aspect with windows provided to the front and rear elevations. However, the application proposes a limited number of openings resulting in concerns regarding the effect in allowing adequate penetration of light into the internal accommodation. The principle source of light would be taken from the rear openings which are relatively small. The application has not been supported by an independent technical daylight/sunlight assessment/report to demonstrate that all of the proposed rooms would be provided with daylight, sunlight and daylight distribution levels exceeding the minimum recommended guidelines given by BRE. \r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the Borough's Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe proposed ground floor flat would have use of a private rear garden measuring approximately 38sqm, accessed via bi-folding doors from the bedroom and living room. This would be above guidance. \r\rThe proposed first floor flat would have use of an area of garden to the front measuring approximately 9sqm. The garden area for the first floor flat would not meet the minimum quantum standards and the front area would not be counted in the assessment given its lack of usability and poor amenity for future occupiers with its shared function for cycle and refuse/recycling storage.\r\rFire Safety\rA Fire Strategy has not been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed development provides adequate levels of fire safety, in accordance with Policy D12 of the London Plan, 2021. Moderate weight is applied to this level of harm.\r\rOverall\rThe accommodation whilst of a good internal layout and stacking arrangement, the units would fall below the requirements of the nationally described space standards in terms of internal living accommodation and storage space. Additionally, Officers have concerns regarding the light ingress provided to the internal accommodation from the windows. The outdoor amenity space serving the first floor flat is considered to represent poor quality amenity areas in terms of usability owing to its size, siting and configuration with shared function as cycle and refuse storage area. \r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated that the proposed development would be afforded adequate levels of fire safety.\rOverall, officers conclude that the proposals would offer a poor quality standard of accommodation for the two proposed flats. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe application site is bounded on the southwest by a gable and flank walls of a residential development at the rear of No. 92A Leatherhead Road, and to the northwest by a low brick wall and planted barrier fronting the properties on the gated Sienna Close development. To the northeast, the proposal abuts a gable wall of a residential development at the rear of No. 88 Leatherhead Road. The southeast elevation faces the rear of those properties fronting Leatherhead Road, with the rear garden amenity area abutting the end of an outbuilding to the No. 90 property.\r\rThe application proposes the erection of a two-storey building comprising of two flats (one laid across each floor). The building would infill the existing gap in the built form between land parcels to the rear of No. 88 and No. 92A Leatherhead Road. \r\rA flat roof is proposed which would have a planted sedum cover to a height which generally fits the two neighbouring buildings. Proposed external finishes would be of a matching or similar appearance to each of the neighbouring buildings, with facing brickwork as the principal material for the elevations and reddish brown clay tiles as the roofing material and white upvc for windows and doors.\r\rOverall, officers consider that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe proposed dwellinghouse would be sited so as to infill between two existing two-storey developments to the rear of No's 88 and 92 Leatherhead Road. \r\rThe properties to the rear of the site on Sienna Close are approximately 24m from the closest unit. This separation distance is considered to prevent any significant adverse impact upon the residential amenities of these properties from being affected.\r\rThe submitted proposed block plan is unclear as to the extent of the proposed built footprint in relation to each neighbouring property (officer note that the plot to the rear of No. 92 is currently under construction) as well as the relationship, specifically separation distances to the rear building of No. 90 Leatherhead Road and any outbuilding structure to the rear yard of No. 90.\r\rAs such, it has not been possible to adequately assess the impacts of the proposed development on neighbouring occupiers amenity in terms of privacy, overlooking, outlook, visual dominance or daylight/sunlight impacts. \r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rAccess\rThe vehicular access to the site would remain as existing and it is not considered that its use would materially intensify. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 2, which represents a poor level of accessibility by means of public transport. Policy 6.1 within Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021 requires the proposed development to have a maximum of 0.75 car parking spaces. \r\rThere is inconsistency in the information submitted in that the application form states that no parking spaces are proposed and the supporting design and access statement refers to at least 1no. parking space being retained to serve the proposed development. Should 1no. car parking space be proposed then this would closely follow the London Plan maximum parking standards and would be the maximum parking provision considered acceptable by the Council at this site. \r\rOfficers note that planning permission reference 06/10116/FUL pertaining to No. 90 Leatherhead Road included a condition (no. 7) requiring scaled drawings showing the layout of the proposed parking area to the land to the rear for approval by the Council and for this to thereafter be provided prior to the first use of the premises and not used for any other purposes other than car parking for the tattoo parlour occupying the commercial unit at No. 90 Leatherhead Road. This condition was successfully discharged on 11 July 2007. There is no record of any subsequent formal application to the Council to remove or alter this condition. The application hereby put forward does not include any reference to, or include any technical transport assessment of, the impact of the proposed residential development to the parking for staff/visitors to the tattoo parlour. Officers therefore have unresolved concerns regarding the impact to parking congestion and highways safety resulting from the proposed development. \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards. Development proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for minimum of 3no. cycle parking spaces. Cycle enclosure is shown for each proposed unit, however, it is unclear from the proposed submitted plans as to the quantum of cycle spaces proposed to serve each dwelling. \r\rNotwithstanding, a condition would be attached to any grant of planning permission to ensure that these cycle spaces are set within dedicated, high-quality enclosures within the curtilage of the application site.\r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rThe plans show that the waste and recycling bins will be stored within enclosures to the application site. A pre-commencement condition would be recommended to ensure that these bins are contained within suitably high-quality, ventilated enclosure(s) and details submitted to the local planning authority for assessment and approval.\r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2021 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy SI2 of the London Plan 2021 requires all new major developments to be zero carbon. However, it does not set any requirements for minor developments.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency and CO2 reductions. \r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. \r\rThe development would also be liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 4, for which the charge is £50 per square metre. \r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \rParagraph 11 of the NPPF states that where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless:\r\r- the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or; \r- any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rIt is noted that the Council does not have a 5 year housing supply. \r\rThe proposed development would provide 2no. net additional market housing units. Although the proposal would make a positive contribution towards the Borough's housing supply, only two one-bedroom flats would be provided. As such, the proposal's positive contribution to the Borough's housing stock and the associated social benefits it would bring to the community would be somewhat limited. This is afforded significant weight in favour of the proposals.\r\rOfficers find that the proposed development would provide for poor quality living accommodation in terms of undersized floor areas, lack of storage space and concerns regarding adequate daylight/sunlight ingress. External amenity space for future occupiers of the first floor flat would similarly constitute poor quality provision. Officers assign significant weighting to this in the overall assessment.\r\rThe proposals have been assessed as acceptable in terms of impact to the character and appearance of the area. This matter is given neutral weighting in the planning balancing exercise. \r\rThere is insufficient/incomplete information submitted as part of the application proposals to allow Officers to adequately assess the proposal in terms of its impact upon neighbouring occupiers (i.e. those both built and currently under construction) resulting from its built footprint and relationship to neighbouring built form and windows. Officers give this significant weight against the proposals.\r\rIn highways terms, the proposals lead to concerns regarding the displacement of the existing car parking to serve the commercial unit (currently occupied as a tattoo parlour) fronting No. 90 Leatherhead Road and potential for increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. Officers give substantial weighting to this in the overall assessment of the proposals.\r\rThe proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and it is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the provision of two 1-bedroom flats in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole.\r\rIt is therefore recommended that the application be refused.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.\r",

    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\r6x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor flat roofed rear extension would be 2.82 metres high and would project to the same depth as the existing extension. The proposed extension would be built above the party wall shared with no.42 East Road and it would have an acceptable impact on the host property and the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor rear extension would replace an existing extension. For this reason, it is considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of either neighbouring property at no.38 or no.42 East Road, by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side/rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed first floor rear extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, as it would propose a flat roof, given that it would have a modest depth and would meet the eaves height of the original roofslope, officers consider that it would not detract from the character of the original dwelling. Further, given that it was designed to match the first floor elements on neighbouring properties No. 144 and 146 Kings Road, officers consider it would not appear out of keeping with the appearance of the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest depth of the first floor rear extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. \r\rWhile openings are proposed to the west elevation at first floor level to mitigate against any potential loss of privacy, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that the windows are obscure-glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rGiven the modest eaves height and that the proposed single storey rear/side extension would not extend past the existing rear elevation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposal would sever the existing access to the rear of the garden, officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure that cycle parking is provided in the event of an approval.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site is occupied by a two storey detached dwelling, and is a corner site located on the southern side of Lawrence Avenue where it intersects with Landseer Road.\r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints.\r\rThe proposal seeks permission for demolition of existing rear conservatory, erection of front porch, part two storey part single storey infill to side and rear extension with juliet balcony in first floor. Erection of roof extension with 1no rear and 2nos side dormers, installation of 3 nos front, 2 nos side  roof light to facilitate loft conversion. Formation of dropped kerb.\r\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation has been received objecting to the proposal on the following grounds:\r\rScale of development \rJuliet balconies and dormer windows would look incongruous and bulky additions to the property\rIncrease in traffic and demand for parking as a rental property \r\rRBK Highways - The proposed crossover onto Lawrence Avenue would fall within 10 metres of the junction with Landseer Road. This is not permissible under the RBK Crossover Policy Guidance for reasons of highway safety. It is noted that the property appears to already have a shared crossover access to a garage on Landseer Road which is a sufficient distance from the junction but for this reason of highway safety with respect to the new crossover we cannot support the application as submitted.\r\rSubsequent to the original submission, revised drawings have been submitted to include the following:\r\rRemoval of the side dormers at second floor level\rRemoval of the Juliet balconies to the rear elevation, replaced with windows\rRemoval of the proposed crossover\r\rNeighbours were consulted on the revised drawings and no further representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on Highways.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rOfficers note elements of the proposal have been deemed acceptable by previous planning permissions (20/00862/PAEXT & 20/00295/CPU) including the front porch, and the single storey ground floor rear extension. \r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would maintain the building line of the existing building as it relates to the Landseer Road elevation, and the existing rear building line at ground floor level, sitting behind the proposed single storey rear extension.  It would have a roof form that relates to the host dwelling and would not appear an incongruous addition.\r\rAt second floor level the proposed roof extension and dormer would be of an acceptable scale and design that is in proportion to the host dwelling. No objection is raised to the proposed rooflights.\r\rExternal materials and fenestration details will be in keeping with the existing dwelling.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be an acceptable impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It has been demonstrated that the proposed development would not unduly harm No, 24 Lawrence Avenue in terms of loss of outlook, daylight/sunlight and the proposed development is sufficiently setback from the rear boundary, that serves No.1  Landseer Road. Any new windows are located as such that they would not directly face any neighbouring property, or serve utility and bathroom areas.\r\rHaving regard to the above and the corner site location of the application property, it is not considered the development would adversely affect the amenities of any neighbouring properties. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. The application property and garden is of an adequate size to accommodate dedicated and secure cycle storage, to be required by conditions. The proposal is therefore considered to achieve general compliance with Policy T5.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
