    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\r\rApplication site\r\rThe site is occupied by a semi detached two storey building (forms a pair with No.23 Vallis Way) with an internal single garage and drive on access.  \r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension, part conversion of the existing garage to habitable space with associated changes to fenestration and installation of 2 x side rooflights and; the erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSingle storey rear extension\rResidential Design SPD Policy Guidance 33 for rear extensions, states that single storey extensions proposed with a flat roof should not exceed 3.5m in depth or 3m in height. \r\rIn this case, the full width rear extension would project 3m from the rear elevation with a flat roof 3.5m. The extension would align No.23 Vallis Way, and although project beyond that of No.19, the extension is modest in size, in keeping with SPD policy guidance 33 (residential single storey extensions) and respects the character and appearance of the surrounding area. External materials to the walls, roof and proposed window and doors would match the existing building.\r\r\rHip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions\rIt is noted that the proposed roof extensions would meet the permitted development criteria, however in this case the Residential Design SPD policy guidance must also be taken into consideration.  \r\rResidential Design SPD Guidance (Policy 40) in relation to gable end extension states the need to maintain the visual balance of semi detached properties when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area.  In this case the proposed hip to gable would alter the symmetry of two houses (No roof alterations have been made to 23) and be visually dominant and overbearing when viewed from the street or surrounding properties. There is also no evidence of similar extensions in the immediate vicinity.  \r\rSPD Guidance for dormer windows states that dormer windows should allow the conversion of a loft space, but not dominate the form of the existing roof. The rear dormer in this case is at odds with the existing roof form by virtue of its minimal setbacks (less than 500mm) from the side elevations of the host building and is unduly visually dominant when viewed from the street and neighbouring properties at Nos 19 and 23 Vallis Way.\r\rHaving regard to the above the proposal is contrary to the SPD guidance and officers consider the proposed development would have a negative impact on the area.  \r\rPartial conversion of garage space\rThe existing garage would be partially converted to provide a utility room and WC on the ground floor. The appearance of the property would remain unchanged when viewed from the street and the remaining space retained for garage use would be retained, albeit a smaller space. It is also noted the property has drive on access and provision for parking in the front garden which would also be retained. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have a positive impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe single storey rear extension and conversion of garage are considered acceptable in terms of neighbour amenity.\r\rWhilst the scale and form of proposed roof extension and dormer are not considered visually acceptable, they would not result in any harm to neighbouring properties in terms of loss of privacy or daylight/sunlight. The proposed rooflights, door and windows to the front roof slope and rear elevation are typical of this development type and located with a satisfactory distance to ensure the amenities of neighbouring and surrounding properties are ensured. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be approved, officers conclude that planning permission should be REFUSED.\r\r",
