    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "Please provide proposed ground, first floor and roof plans at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works."
