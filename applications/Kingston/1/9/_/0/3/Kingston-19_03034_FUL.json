    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r21 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections have been received relating to:\r\r- Access or traffic problems;\r- Car park issues; and,\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings.\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rTfL - No objection subject to informatives/comments.\r\rRBK Transport Officer - No objection given the location on the Transport for London Road Network\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed front boundary wall would be 1.15m in height with additional railings, while the height would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, officers note that it would be considered acceptable given that it would be no higher than what is already existing. Further, the proposed gate would be the same design as what is existing and as such officers consider that it would appear an appropriate addition to the application site.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the nature of the proposal and siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed boundary treatment would be no higher than what is existing, given that it would have a height over 1m and the fact that no visibility splays have been provided, it is unclear whether the proposed development would ensure pedestrian and vehicular intervisibility. For this reason, officers consider that a condition should be imposed in the event of an approval to ensure that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on highway safety.\r\rSubject to the satisfaction of the above condition, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant will need to enter into a Section 278 agreement with TfL for the proposed crossover extension. It should be noted that TfL will have to approve and agree any amendments to the highway and all costs must be covered by the applicant.",
    "The footway and carriageway on the A3 Kingston Bypass must not be blocked during the works. Temporary obstructions during the works must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the red route Beverly Way.",
    "All vehicles associated with the works must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions. No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor extension would maintain the characteristic cat-slide roof of the original dwelling and adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, as such it would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed two storey side extension would be set back from the front boundary and would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling, it would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, as it would not be set in from the shared boundary and at first floor level would propose a footprint in excess of the original dwelling. As such, officers consider that it would appear bulky and proportionally out of scale with the original dwelling, and would appear an incongruous addition on the Malden Way streetscene.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the development would not accord with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, given the separation distance between the proposed development and habitable windows of the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, by reason scale, siting and design, the proposed two storey side extension would appear excessive in scale, dominant and would not appear subordinate to the host dwelling, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a flat within a semi-detached property. The property is located within Grove Crescent Conservation Area.\r\r20 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to: \r- Car park issues;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings;\r- Noise; and,\r- Privacy.\r\rOfficers note there would be no proposed change to the existing parking situation on site as part of this application. As such, this issues cannot be considered. The remaining concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee - No objection, but raising the height of the extension will have an adverse effect on the light and character of the adjoining footpath.\r\rProposal\rThis application proposes an extension to Flat 5 to accommodate a 1 person, 1 bedroom dwelling arranged over 2 floors. Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 20/02291/FUL. The principal issue with the refused application was that the proposal would provide an inadequate amount of internal floorspace for a 2 person 1 bedroom dwelling set over 2 floors and would have resulted in a substandard form of accommodation that would be to the detriment of future occupants. \r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- Flood Risk Assessment; and,\r- The impact of the development on Grove Crescent Conservation Area.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor side extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD in terms of set in from the shared boundary, it would be set down substantially from the ridge of the main roof slope and as such would appear a subservient addition to the host dwelling. While the roof form would be slightly unusual, it would make use of materials that would match the existing dwelling and would not appear an incongruous addition to the host property or the surrounding street scene. Dormers to the front of the roof slope are typically resisted, however, given that existing front dormers are viewed on properties within the immediate vicinity, it would not appear out of keeping with the character of the area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development, its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, and the fact that no windows or openings are proposed to the side elevation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. As the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to the existing residential accommodation officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rThe proposal would create additional floorspace to the ground floor studio property (Flat 5). The new unit would comprise a one-bedroom flat, for one person, arranged over two floors and as such would require a minimum internal floorspace of 39sqm. Given that the unit would propose an internal floorspace of 40.8sqm, the extended unit would meet the minimum policy requirements set out in the London Plan. Whilst no proposed section drawings have been provided for the proposed first floor extension, it is clear from the plans provided that an improved standard of accommodation would be provided.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area can be summarised as a planned mid-Victorian estate of houses of various sizes and styles, the core of which forms the Spring Grove Estate, including St John's Church, a school, and local shops. As noted above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the area and it would be in keeping with the features of the original house.  It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not harm the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building located on the northern side of Elm Road.\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\rProposal\r\rPlanning permission is sought for the demolition of an existing conservatory and erection of a single storey side/rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r   \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy guidance 33 and 35 of the Residential Design Guide SPD states that single storey side and rear extensions should not exceed 3.5m in depth, that the roof of the extension should relate well to the main house, and the height of the roof should never encroach on the sill of the windows of the second storey. Side extensions to semi detached dwellings should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi detached property.  \r\rIn this case, the proposed extension would measure 4.5m in depth and 4.1m in width, with an 800mm setback to the boundary with No.167 Elm Road. The extension would have a rendered concrete finish, with two pitched metal roof elements; a larger and higher roof across the rear elevation and lower roof to the side extension, the higher extending beyond the sill height of windows at first floor level.\r\rThere are no rear extensions to the neighbouring properties at No. 167 and No.171 Elm Road and the proposed extension would project beyond both rear building lines of these properties and others in the immediately surrounding area.\r\rWhilst it is noted there is an existing conservatory extension to the host building, it is a glazed, lightweight structure. The proposed extension would be a visually dominant, solid concrete structure with a metal roof that does not relate to the existing building, in terms of both scale or design. The host building and surrounding properties are characterised by brick and tile finishes and although the extension is to the rear, it is not considered that the combination of the proposed scale and external treatment of the extension are acceptable.\r \rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered  unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design, and would result in unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area in this specific regard.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers acknowledge there is an existing conservatory extension to the property of similar depth however this is a glazed lightweight structure. The proposed extension would have a solid concrete finish with a pitched metal roof much higher than the current height of the conservatory.  \r\rThe proposed development would be located directly on the boundary shared with No.171 Elm Road which does not have a rear extension in this location, but has a window to a habitable room which would be directly affected by the extension, particularly in terms of outlook.\r\rThe property at No.167 Elm Road has not been extended, and despite the setback from the shared boundary the combined scale, depth and design of the extension would appear overbearing when viewed from this property.  \r\rOverall, it is considered that the excessive depth and height of the proposed extension, combined with its siting along the shared boundary would have an overbearing appearance and result in an undue sense of enclosure to the adjoining properties at No.167 and No. 171 Elm Road. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on light/sunlight to the nearest ground floor principal habitable room at No.171 Elm Road.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and neighbouring residential amenity. Officers therefore consider the proposal to be contrary to  the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be approved, officers conclude that planning permission be refused.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a large detached dwelling in spacious, well landscaped grounds located within a Local Area of Special Character and adjoining a Conservation Area. None of the buildings on the site are nationally or locally Listed. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey, flat roof rear extension, which would \"square-off\" the rear elevation. \r\rThe extension would be finished in brick work to match with Crittall style doors.\r\rConsultation\rCAAC - No Comment\rGLASS - No Comment (not referable) \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and associated impact on the setting of the Con Area and the LASC; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.
