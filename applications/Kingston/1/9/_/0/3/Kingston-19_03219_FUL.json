    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The use hereby permitted shall not operate other than between the hours of 0900 and 1800 Mondays to Sundays. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions)  of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be used for purposes falling within Sui Generis (a Chinese herbal medicine, acupuncture and massage salon) only, and for no any other purpose as defined in the Town and Country Planning (Use Classes) Order 1987 (as amended) or in any provision equivalent to that Class in any statutory instruction revoking and re-enacting that Order (with or without modification), without written consent from the Local Planning Authority first being obtained. \r\rReason: To enable the Local Planning Authority to exercise control of the type of use within the category in order to safeguard the amenities of the area in accordance with Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions)  and DM17 (Protecting Existing Employment Land and Premises) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received relating to enhancing biodiversity and the potential to increase swift habitat enhancement on site.\r\rWhile officers note the importance of incorporating biodiversity enhancement measurements in planning developments, given that this would be a small scale householder development, officers consider that it would be unreasonable to apply a condition requiring the applicant to incorporate swift habitat enhancement measures. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Highways and transportation.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 37 of the Residential Design SPD notes that any proposed first floor extension on a cat slide roof should be set back from the front building line by a minimum of 1m to retain the cat-slide roof form. While the proposed first floor extension would not accord with these recommendations, officers note that there are similar developments in the immediate streetscene, and as such this first floor side extension would not appear out of character with the surrounding area. \r\rHowever, in addition to the first floor infill extension a further two storey side extension would be proposed. Policy Guidance 36 also notes that two storey side extensions should be set back from the front dwelling and adequately set down from the original dwelling's roofslope. Given that the proposed two side extension would not accord with these parameters, and there appear to be no similar developments in the immediate surrounding area, officers consider that it would appear a dominant and bulky addition to the host property and would appear visually disruptive in the streetscene.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be slightly larger than the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, however given that it would not be viewed from the streetscene and there are similar developments in the area, officers consider it an acceptable addition to the host property. The first floor rear extension would accord with the parameters set the Residential Design SPD and as such be an appropriate addition to the host property.\r\rThe proposed front porch extension would be of modest dimensions and would have a roof form that is in keeping with the host property.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side extension would not be adequately set in from the shared boundary, or down from the host property's original roof slope and as such would inhibit the light/sunlight coming into the habitable windows on the flank wall of neighbouring property No. 275 South Lane. While openings are proposed to the side elevation, given that they would be obscure glazed, they would not adversely result in a loss of privacy of neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed two storey rear extension and single storey rear extension by virtue of it's siting in relation to the neighbouring properties rear windows, and lack of side windows, would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe proposed front porch, due to its sitting and design would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed side extension would impact on the off-street parking to the side of the host property, there would be adequate space to accommodae 1 off-street car parking space in accordance with the above standards. As such the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10. In terms of cycle parking due to the removal of the external side access from the front to the rear of the property as a result of the proposals and the absence of dedicated cycle storage on the submitted plans, it is unclear as to how the requirements of Policies T5 and DM8 would be met.  However, it is considered that this issue could be secured via condition in the event of an approval.\r\rIn conclusion, due to the siting, scale, mass and form of the proposed two storey side extension, the proposed development would result in an incongruous and bulky addition to the host property and would not visually integrate with the character and appearance of the area. Further, given the scale and siting of the proposed two storey side extension in relation to the shared boundary, the proposed development would adversely result in an unacceptable loss of light to the habitable windows on the flank wall of No. 275 South Lane. As such, the proposal is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
