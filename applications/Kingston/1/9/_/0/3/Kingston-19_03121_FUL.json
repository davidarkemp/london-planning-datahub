    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rFront Porch - Officers note the various type of porches within the streetscene. The proposed porch would sit forward of the original building line but would be in line with the adjoining property's garage. It is considered not to have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area. \r\rPitched roof on existing side extension - Officer acknowledge that the proposed roof would further reduce the visual separation between No. 6 and No. 4 Tudor Drive. However, the change from a flat roof to pitched is considered a betterment and would improve the character and appearance of the host dwelling and immediate surrounding area.\r\rRear extension - The proposed first floor rear extension would not be visible from the front of the property.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principle properties to be considered in relation to amenities are No. 2 and No. 6 Tudor Drive. Due to the orientation of the properties along side the existing situation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. However, due to the loss of the garage and lack of access to the rear garden from the front of the property it has not been demonstated how secure cycle parking can be accomodated on site. Further information regarding this would be secured by condition.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified and one representation has been received. This did not object to the proposed development but raised concerns regarding possible blocking of the shared parking space to rear. An informative will be included regarding considerate parking. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner.

    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a three storey building. It is currently vacant but its lawful use is as a banking hall at ground floor level and ancillary offices above.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks a temporary change of use (for up to five years) from a bank to residential accommodation. \r\rThe stated intention is that five \"property guardians\" would occupy the site while a new commercial occupier is found.\r\rConsultations\r13 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rKingston Town CAAC - Objection on the grounds of insufficient information relating to the elevations and the use of the ground floor.\r\rLead Local Flood Authority - Objection on the grounds of insufficient information relating to surface water management.\r\rRBK Highways and Transportation - No response received.\r\rOfficer Response: The applicant has confirmed that there would be no changes to the elevations. The application seeks the change of use of the entirety of the building. Given that the application does not propose any operational development, there would not be any impact on surface water drainage and it would be unreasonable to request details of surface water management.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of this application are:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- The impact of the development on the transport network.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rOfficers note that the application seeks a change of use to a sui generis residential use. However, officers consider that the use as a residence for five non-related persons, where those persons would share basic amenities, falls within Class C4 (houses in multiple occupation) of the Schedule to the Use Classes Order. As such, the proposed development involves the provision of housing.\r\rPolicy H1 of the London Plan 2021 sets a target for the Borough of 9,640 net housing completions within the next ten years. Planning decisions should optimise the potential for housing delivery on all suitable and available brownfield sites to ensure that this target is met.\r\rThe existing lawful use of the site is as a bank, which is a use that supports employment. Furthermore, the site is located within a key employment area, namely Kingston Town Centre. Policy DM17 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 seeks to protect employment land and premises for employment uses unless it can be demonstrated, through the provision of marketing evidence over a number of years, that there is no qualitative or quantitative need for a range of employment uses. No such evidence has been put forward by the applicant and the proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to policy DM17. This carries weight against the proposal.\r\rThe applicant has suggested that the proposal accords with policy SD7 of the London Plan 2021 and that this carries weight in favour of the proposal. However, policy SD7 does not directly support meanwhile uses but instead encourages Boroughs to \"support flexibility for temporary or 'meanwhile' uses of vacant properties\" in their development plans. Officers note that the Core Strategy does not offer this support and that the draft new local plan is at a very early stage of preparation.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires developments to provide adequate private and/or communal amenity space. Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new flat should have 10m2 (plus an extra 1sqm for each occupant after the first). Policy Guidance 14 requires flatted developments to be provided with communal outdoor space, measuring 50sqm plus any shortfall in private outdoor space.\r\rThe proposed development would comply with the requirements of policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. However, it would not provide any private or communal outdoor space for occupants and the proposal is therefore contrary to policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed development would not involve any changes to the external appearance of the building. Officers therefore consider that the impact of the proposal on the character and appearance of the area would be acceptable.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area lies in its historic status as an important market town, port and river crossing from the early medieval period. It is close to the historic royal estates at Hampton Court, Bushy Park and Richmond Park and the old core of the town around All Saints Church and Market Place, with its recognisably medieval street pattern, is the best preserved of its type in outer London.\r\rGiven that the proposed development would not involve any alterations to the external appearance of the building, officers are satisfied that it would not have any impact on the character and appearance of the conservation area or any impact on its significance.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed development would not involve the introduction of any additional built form to the site, nor would it give rise to any noise and disturbance over and above what would normally be expected from a residential use. In light of this, officers consider that the impact of the proposal on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rTransport\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe proposed development would not involve any new or amended access to the public highway or a material change in the character or volume of traffic entering and leaving the site. No on-site car parking is proposed and therefore overspill car parking on surrounding streets may give rise to inconsiderate parking that would, in turn, compromise highway safety. Accordingly, officers recommend that any permission be subject to a legal agreement to preclude occupants of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits in the surrounding controlled parking zone. Subject to this, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rAccording to policy T5 of the London Plan, the proposed development should provide two cycle parking spaces. None are shown on the submitted plans (nor are any noted on the application form) and it is unclear whether the site could accommodate any, since the boundary of the site has been drawn tightly around the perimeter of the building (rather than including any of the yard to the rear). Officers therefore consider the proposal to be contrary to policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM8 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rAs noted above, the proposed development would not involve the provision of any on-site car parking. Given that the site benefits from excellent access to public transport (PTAL 6a), this accords with policy T6.1 of the London Plan and is considered to be appropriate, subject to a legal agreement to preclude occupants of the development from obtaining Council-issued car parking permits.\r\rOther Matters\rOfficers note that a staircase is shown on the submitted first floor plans but is absent from the ground and second floor plans. The only access to the upper floors of the building would therefore be via the rear external staircase but this appears to fall outside of the site boundary.\r\rConclusion\rThe scheme under consideration involves the provision of housing and the Council cannot demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. Therefore, the \"tilted balance\" as set out in paragraph 11 of the NPPF is engaged.\r\rThe proposed development would provide one additional dwelling on the site, albeit on a temporary basis. This is a benefit that carries significant weight in favour of the proposal.\r\rBalanced against this is the fact that the proposal would result in the loss of employment premises in a key employment location. Officers note that the site forms part of a primary shopping frontage in a primary shopping area. This, in itself, does not weigh against the proposal (since the site is not currently in a retail use) but it does suggest that the site would be attractive to a retail occupier (particularly the ground floor level). The applicant has not submitted any evidence to demonstrate a lack of demand for the site for retail purposes or, for that matter, any other use that would sustain employment. Officers recognise that the coronavirus pandemic is likely to have depressed the market for commercial occupiers in town centres. However, as the country emerges from a second period of lockdown, the availability of prime town centre locations for businesses is likely to play a significant role in the economic recovery. Having regard to these considerations, officers attach significant weight to the harm arising from the loss of employment premises and the conflict with policy DM17 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe proposed development would also fail to provide cycle parking in accordance with policy T5 of the London Plan 2021. Given that occupants of the development would be reliant on modes of transport other than private vehicles, officers consider the provision of adequate cycle parking to be of particular importance. The presence of nearby on-street cycle parking is noted but this would not be sufficiently secure for long term use. Officers therefore attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe development would also fail to provide any private or communal outdoor space for occupants. However, noting that the town centre provides a wide range of amenities, including public outdoor green spaces, officers attach limited weight to this harm.\r\rThe impacts of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area, on heritage assets, and on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers are considered to be acceptable. These are neutral matters.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. \r\rParagraph 11 of the NPPF is a material consideration and the application therefore falls to be assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. In making this assessment, officers particularly note the emphasis the NPPF places on building a strong economy. Emphasis is also placed on making an effective use of land, including the re-use of underutilised buildings but in this case, there is little evidence to suggest that the building would be underutilised if presented to potential commercial occupiers. \r\rOfficers therefore consider that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. It follows that Paragraph 11 does not warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",

The extension would however, be highly visible from Mayfair Close. Officers note that a similar extension has been permitted on the opposite corner at No. 37 Broadmead Avenue (13/14118/HOU granted 10/04/2013). In this instance given the surrounding development, the proposed rear extension is not considered to be out of character with the area so as to warrant refusal.

Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed works to the garage do not result in a smaller footprint than the existing situation. There will be no loss of parking to the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling which remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
