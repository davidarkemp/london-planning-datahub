    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey rear extension and raised patio.\r\rConsultation\r6 adjoining neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed extension would be of an acceptable height and although would project slightly beyond the parameters of the SPD in terms of depth, would maintain the existing separation from the neighbouring property at No.2 The Glebe. Officers also note that permission (19/01774/PNH) has been granted to No.6 The Glebe for a single storey rear extension 5m (d) x 3.83m(h), and this is currently under construction. The proposed extension would be 4m (d) x 3.9m (h).\r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design, and that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed extension would be set behind the rear building line of the extension at No.6 The Glebe (currently under construction). \r\rThere are some windows at No.2 The Glebe that currently have limited outlook given their side location. The extension would maintain the existing setback from the boundary and incorporate a pitched roof design to minimise the impact of any sense of enclosure.   Officers also acknowledge that an extension deeper than proposed would be possible under permitted development.\r\rTaking this into account, although the proposal may result in some loss of light to the window in the side elevation of No. 2, the level of outlook from this window is unlikely to be any worse as a result of the current development, than experienced through a similar or potentially larger proposal under permitted development. \r\rIt is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",
