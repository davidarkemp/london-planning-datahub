    "The proposed change from office to residential is considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 3, Class O of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "The site and building works required to implement the development shall be only carried out between the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "Prior to commencement of the development the applicant shall provide a scheme to the Local Planning Authority for its written approval detailing sound transmission reduction measures to be installed between the ground floor use and the first floor flat.  The scheme shall be designed to provide at least DNTw+Ctr 50dB. Once agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority the approved details shall be installed prior to the development being occupied and retained thereafter.\r\rReason:   These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect the subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to safeguard the amenities of the future residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Parking\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would measure 6m in depth which is over the parameters set by the Residential Design Guide SPD for semi-detached dwellings (3 - 3.5m depth). Further, while the roof form would not necessarily be in keeping with the host property, it is noted that it would be in a common contemporary and have a modest eaves height. Therefore, officers consider that it would be an appropriate addition to the host property and given that neighbouring properties benefit from extensions of a similar scale it would not appear out of keeping with the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposal would also see the existing garage converted into habitable accommodation with associated changes to the front fenestration. The existing garage door is proposed to be replaced with a modest size window that would be in matching materials to the windows of the host property.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would be built up to the shared boundary with adjoining property No. 2 Hook Rise, and would measure approx 2m further in depth than adjoining property's rear extension. Given depth in relation to the adjoining property's rear extension it would not unduly impact the amenities of No.2 Hook Rise.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would measure 6m further in depth than neighbouring property No. 6 Hook Rise's rear elevation, but it would be separated from the shared boundary by 1m and separated from the flank wall of No.6 by approx 1.7m. While the development would extend further in depth than is recommended, given the siting of the development and low eaves height, it would not unduly impact the amenities of this adjoining property.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal seeks to convert the existing garage into habitable space. Officers note that the existing garage measures approx 2.4m by 4.6m, and as such would not conform to minimum modern day internal standards for garages, as specified by the Sustainable Transport SPD. As such, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off site parking, and therefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 4 representations have been received relating to;\r\r-Impact to streetscene,\r-Scale and bulk of development\r-Impact to amenities of adjoining properties\r-Impact to trees\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed replacement side extension would be of the same width and depth as what is existing. It would come no further forward than what is existing and would propose similar store doors on the front fenestration. While the flat roof would stay as existing, a parapet wall is proposed to the front of the side extension and would measure 3.3m to the ridge, within what is recommended by the Residential Design Guide SPD. Similarly it would be designed to match the existing roof forms of No. 91 and No. 97 Portland Avenue. Therefore, the proposed side extension would be in keeping with the surrounding area and host property.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would measure 5m which is above the parameters set by the Residential Design Guide SPD for semi-detached dwellings (3 - 3.5m depth) and would be built up the shared boundaries with the adjoining properties. However, officers note that adjoining property No. 91 enjoys an existing rear extension of similar dimensions, while adjoining property No. 95 benefits from an existing rear extension of 3.3m. Further, while the proposed flat roof roof form would not strictly be in keeping with the host property, officers note that it is of a contemporary design that is not uncommon in the surrounding area. In any case it would be a modest height and not be viewed from the streetscene, minimising the proposed developments impact in the surrounding area. As such officer's consider the proposed rear extension as a proportionate addition to the host property. \r\rWhilst raised as an objection by residents there is no evidence to support the notion that the proposed development would harm any trees.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed replacement side extension would be of similar dimensions to what is existing and propose no windows to the side elevation, therefore it is considered that there would be no adverse impact to neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be built up the shared boundaries and measure 5m. Given that neighbouring property No. 91 Portland Avenue benefits from an existing rear extension of the same depth, officers consider that there would be no adverse effect on the amenities of this neighbouring property. No. 95 Portland Avenue benefits from an existing rear extension of 3.3m and as such given the scale and siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring property, it would not unduly impact the amenities of No. 95 Portland Avenue.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate off street car parking, thus not affecting the amenity of local residents or the street scene in the surrounding area. \r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
