    "Prior to occupation details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development hereby approved have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  These facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to occupation details of refuse storage facilities and recycling facilities shall be provided prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted in accordance with details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to the commencement of the development, such facilities to be permanently retained at the site.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of refuse facilities to the satisfaction of the Council in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to occupation the balustrades in relation to the balcony in the rear elevation (and situated on the first floor) shall be constructed and retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to occupation the following details shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, implemented prior to occupation and thereafter permanently retained:\r\r(a) boundary treatment related to the private amenity spaces associated with units 64A and 64B (including their manufacturer's specification, colour and texture).\r\rReason: In order to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted a hard and soft landscaping scheme including where applicable the retention of the existing trees shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.  Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only.  \r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The flat roof of the extension(s) hereby permitted, except the area specifically allocated to flat 64C, shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

The development shall only be implemented in accordance with the details and measures approved as part of the construction management plan, which shall be maintained throughout the entire construction period.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The proposed development would amount to development as defined by Section 55 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) (material change in use) and as such would require planning permission (Section 57 of the Act).\r\rSection 191 of the Town and Country Planning Act directs that (1)If any person wishes to ascertain whether— \r(a)any existing use of buildings or other land is lawful; \r(b)any operations which have been carried out in, on, over or under land are lawful; or \r(c)any other matter constituting a failure to comply with any condition or limitation subject to which planning permission has been granted is lawful,he may make an application for the purpose to the local planning authority specifying the land and describing the use, operations or other matter. Section 191 further directs\r\r(2) For the purposes of this Act uses and operations are lawful at any time if— \r(a)no enforcement action may then be taken in respect of them (whether because they did not involve development or require planning permission or because the time for enforcement action has expired or for any other reason); and \r(b)they do not constitute a contravention of any of the requirements of any enforcement notice then in force.\r\rThe proposed use of the detached outbuilding for a dog grooming parlour would go beyond that which is incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse and would result in a marked rise in traffic and disturbance to adjoining neighbours. \r\rThe details in the application form submitted would allow for up to 20 dogs to be groomed a week over 5 days between 1000 and 1700 hours, resulting in up to 8 vehicle movements a day, which is considered to go beyond a part time 'hobby' use and allow a full time business to operate which would constitute a material change of use of the property from a residential dwelling to a mixed use of dwelling and business\r\rWere the applicant minded to pursue the proposals any further a full planning application would be required for the proposed development.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site is located within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets; and, \r- The impact of the development on protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:. Officers note that the retrospective application of conversion of existing garage to living space with the installation of 1no rooflight and associated changes to fenestration the rear extension would be visible from the streetscene in regards to the door to window change. However, it would relate well to the host property and would not harm the character and appearance of the wider area. \r\rOverall, this retrospective application is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the retrospective development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The dimensions of the existing garage would safely accommodate on-site car parking and would provide cycle parking compyling with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. However, it is noted that the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide 2 adequate car parking spaces, which would be acceptable levels of on-site car parking. The loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted for approval.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would generally be in keeping with host property and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area, as such officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rTrees\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) states that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: While no arboricultural information has been submitted, it is noted that the conversion would be within the existing footprint of the development. Therefore the proposed development would not result in any direct adverse impact on protected trees on site.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises of an abandoned garage building, to the rear of 85 Malden Hill, New Malden KT3 4DS 21x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received \r\rRBK Highways:- The existing vehicle crossover would remain in its present position and on that basis there are no Highways objections.\r\rProposal\rErection of new garage building following demolition of existing garage building.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- Principle of Development\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- Highway Issues;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe proposed development seeks planning permission for the erection of a new garage building following the demolition of existing garage building. The existing use of the site is identified as car garage (Class B8), in the application form - however, the Council has no evidence of this and the state of repair of the site suggests that there is no ongoing use of the site. The application site is located in a suburban residential area and is not within a designated employment location identified under Policy DM17 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012). Nor is the site identified as a Strategic Industrial Location or a Locally Significant Industrial Site in the London Plan (2021).\r\rPolicy DM18 (New Employment Uses) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that any applications for new development outside designated employment locations must be of an appropriate scale and have been planned positively in order to minimise any negative impacts on: climate change, pollution, transport and accessibility, design and character and the amenity of surrounding residents. Policy DM17 identifies the Borough's Strategic Industrial Locations (SILs) and Locally Significant Industrial Sites (LSISs) as forming the main supply of industrial/business land which will be protected for B1, B2 and B8 uses.\rThe applicant has stated that the \r\r\"titled plot of land along with garage has been bought by (their) company : Lineco Ltd. The plot and the garage will not be used as commercial purpose as (it was) bought the plot for car park use, and garage for mainly for file storage.(There is) no intention at all to use it for any commercial purpose\".\r\rNo detailed assessment of the proposal against Local Development Plan policy(ies) has been submitted by the applicant. \r\rThe application site is located in a suburban residential area which is characterised by two-storey family dwellings. The application site consists of a disused garage building \r\rThe proposed Class B8 use in this residential location has not been planned positively in order to minimise negative impacts on pollution, transport and accessibility, design and character and the amenity of surrounding residents. The site has a PTAL of only 2 (poor) and is surrounded by residential properties. The proposed Class B8 use would allow for a more intensive use of the site than the existing use of the garage.\r\rIt is considered that no cogent argument or evidence to justify the proposal in terms of its sustainability, accessibility, impact on neighbours, or the standard of amenity for existing neighbouring residential properties, , has been put forward. The proposed storage use is considered to be incompatible within this residential suburban location.\rOverall, it is considered that the change of use of the land to storage (Class B8) would be unacceptable in principle.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is stated in the application that he proposed garage building would have a aluminium framed door, timber cladding and glass fibre flat roofing, Having regard to the above and the design of the proposal, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the streetscene and character and appearance of the area.\r\rHighways and Transport\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy CS5 seeks to reduce the need to travel; it is stated that sites that have poor levels of accessibility by sustainable modes will not usually be considered suitable for development that could generate high numbers of trips.\r\rThe Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has raised no objection in principle to the change of use of the land proposed. However, from a broader planning policy perspective it is considered that the proposed storage and distribution use (Class B8) in this residential area with a PTAL of only 2 (poor) would be highly unsustainable and would likely increase the use of the car as a mode of transport to and from the site due to its poor accessibility. \rThe Planning Application Form submitted states there are no existing employees on the site and states that there are no employees proposed with the proposed change of use and proposed development. The Planning Application Form submitted also states the proposed development will not add or remove any parking spaces.\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development in this residential location has poor accessibility by public transport would be highly unsustainable and would likely increase of the use of the car as a mode of transport. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent and complete information, that the proposed development would not adversely impact on-street car parking capacity which could harm the amenities of neighbouring properties and adversely impact highway safety.\r\rImpact on Neighbouring Amenity\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed storage use would be inappropriate in this suburban residential location with a number of dwellings in close proximity. It is considered that the proposal would result in unacceptable noise and disturbance through introducing a more intensive use to this residential area, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\t\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through a condition. \r\rConclusion\r\rThe proposed change of use of the garage to a storage and distribution (Class B8) use, and the associated operations and paraphernalia associated with that use, would be completely out of character with the suburban residential character of the area, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012). The application site has poor accessibility by public transport and would likely increase of the use of the car as a mode of transport and would therefore fail to encourage sustainable modes of transport. The applicant has also failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent evidence and complete information, that the proposed development would not adversely impact on-street car parking capacity which could harm the amenities of neighbouring properties and adversely impact highway safety, contrary to Paragraphs 108 and 109 of the NPPF (2019), Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012). It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.\r",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Tudor Drive. The site is subject to the Tudor Estate - Local Area of Special Character designation. \r\rConsultations\r\r11x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact on car parking.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposal includes the construction of a single storey front extension.  Policy Guidance 38 (Front Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that Front extensions should be built at least 500mm from an existing bay window.  The proposed front extension would be a distance of 720mm from the front an existing front bay window to the host property.\r\rThe proposed roof extension would not relate well to the host property and appear as an incongruous addition within the streetscene.  The proposed roof extension would not respect the symmetry of the pair of semi-detached properties, of which the host property is part. The current proposal which would be excessive in scale, would not be set-in from the shared boundary and have an undue terracing effect.  The proposed roof extensions would not be proportionate or subordinate and would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host building, wider area and the Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character contrary to Policies DM10, DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012), D3 and HC1 of the London Plan (2021). \r\rWhile it is noted that there is a fall-back position (22/00058/CPU) for a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension, the proposed development currently sought would be of a significantly greater scale and would be much more harmful than the established fall-back position. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed rear extension, would project 3 metres to the rear. It is considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Character is a non-designated heritage asset.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling located. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r \rProposal \rThe applicant seeks planning permission for the erection of a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of two front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion, the erection of single storey rear extension and conversion of garage into a habitable room. \r\rConsultations\r9 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:\rIt is noted that the host dwelling benefits from a two storey side extension and a single storey rear extension and it abouts the common boundary with No 85 Greenfield Avenue, which has also been extended to the side. \r\rThe proposed hip to gable roof extension, due to its scale and siting would be visually intrusive as it would introduce more bulk to the already extended roof and significantly reduce the gap between the host property and neighbouring property. The proposed extension together with the existing enlargement would also unbalance the adjoining semi-detached dwelling and therefore result in incongruous addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers note that the existing street scene has examples of some heavily extended properties of various designs, however not quite to the same degree as the proposal. The scale of the extensions, size of plots and separation distances are very different when comparing them with the proposal.  \r\rIt is acknowledged that conversion of garage into a habitable space with associated alterations is a common feature on Greenfield Avenue, therefore acceptable in this case from a design point of view. \r\rThe proposed dormer would not comply with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Given its scale and bulk, spanning almost the full width of the extended property, the dormer, together with the hip to gable extension, would result in a top heavy appearance rather than as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host dwelling. \r\rWith regards to the proposed single storey rear extension, it is considered to be in compliance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. It is noted that it would be of the same depth, height and design as the existing one, with the main chances to fenestration and the proposed infill to the north-east elevation. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space. Officers also note no parking restrictions on Greenfield Avenue. \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, officers note that it is possible for secure cycle parking to be provided in the garden despite the loss of possible storage within the existing garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

Given that the proposal would be for a tutoring centre, it is considered that the proposal not create additional noise and disturbance to any neighbouring residents \r\rFurther, given that the floorspace of the building would remain the same, with no proposed extensions or alterations to the external building, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, or loss of privacy. \r\rHighways and Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.

While a car-free proposal is considered to be acceptable, given that the proposal would have 5 FTE staff and would support a minimum of 5 students to a maximum of 20 students, officers would require that the applicant provide a travel plan to ensure that the proposal would not adversely impact the highways network, which could be conditioned if planning permission were forthcoming. \r\rThe London Plan would require a commercial space of this nature to provide 1 long stay cycle parking space per 8 FTE staff and 1 short stay cycle parking space per 30 seats.

Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would not implement any external changes to the host property and as such the proposal would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area nor result in any harm to Kingston Town Centre Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r \rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rRBK Transport Officer - No objections\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front boundary treatment would not exceed 1m in height and would use materials that would appear in keeping with the host property. As such, it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed side boundary treatment would appear higher than what is viewed within the immediate area, officers note that the proposal would face a side access road, and while it would be visible from the streetscene, given that it would extend from the existing set of garages adjoining the site, officers note that it would visually blend with the appearance of the garages and as such would not appear incongruous within the streetscene. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed side boundary treatment in relation to neighbouring properties, and the modest height of the proposed front boundary treatment, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the proposed boundary treatment fronting Elm Road would not exceed 1m in height, officers are satisfied that the proposal would provide adequate visibility and as such would not have an adverse impact upon highway safety.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
