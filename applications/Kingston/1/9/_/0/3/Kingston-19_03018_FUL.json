    "The proposed material would be visually incongruous, resulting in a jarring feature within the streetscene and surrounding area and would not ensure a satisfactory apperance on complettion of the development, therby conflicting with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The piling method statement should detail the type of piling to be undertaken, why this method has been selected, measures to be taken to minimise noise and vibration and a plan showing where the piles are to be installed. There are a number of different piling methods suitable for different circumstances. Guidance is contained in BS5228 Noise control on Construction and Open sites - Part 4: Code of Practice for noise and vibration control applicable to piling operations. The contractor is required to take the best practicable means to minimise noise and vibration and the Council positively encourages the use of hydraulic, auger and diaphragm wall piling methods. Where complaints of noise and vibration are received it is expected that the contractor will undertake noise and vibration monitoring, with data reported back to the Environmental Health Service.\r",
    "As the proposed development is within flood zones 2 and 3 or on a site of more than 1ha, you are required to complete a Flood Risk Rorm before the application can be assessed.  For further information and guidance on any aspects of undertaking a Flood Risk Assessment please contact the Environment Agency by visiting their website at http://planningguidance.communities.gov.uk/blog/guidance/flood-risk-and-coastal-change/site-specific-flood-risk-assessment-checklist/\r"
