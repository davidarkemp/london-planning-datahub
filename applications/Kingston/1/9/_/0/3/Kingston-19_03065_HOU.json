    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r\r",
    "The site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed side/rear extension would infill the side return and project beyond the existing rear elevation. It would not strictly adhere to the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of the proposed depth beyond the rearmost rear elevation (4m v. 3-3.5) and would be a substantial extension. However, Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would not be visible from the street and would not be entirely out of keeping with other rear extensions in the vicinity. Therefore, on balance, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the height, depth and siting of the proposed development hard up against the shared boundary with No. 85 Coombe Gardens, officers consider that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest ground floor habitable room windows of No. 85 Coombe Gardens and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the neighbouring property in terms of loss of light/sunlight. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rDue to the separation distance between the application property and No. 89 Coombe Gardens and the nature of extension implemented at the neighbouring property, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 89 Coombe Gardens by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, it is considered that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would pass the 45-degree rule test in relation to the closest ground floor habitable room windows of No. 85 Coombe Gardens and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the neighbouring property in terms of loss of light/sunlight. Therefore, the proposed development is contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
