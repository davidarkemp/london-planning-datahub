The rear extension would also generally follow the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, in regards to the proposed height(3m) and depth(3.5m).\r\rOfficers note that the conversion of the garage into habitable space with alterations to fenestration would slightly alter the appearance of the front elevation, however, it would not significantly detract from the wider streetscene or the host dwelling.\r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the existing garage would safely accommodate on-site car parking and would comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. However, the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted and approved.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and proposed plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point, it does not sufficiently address the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

Additionally, officers note that the flat roof form would not respect the symmetry of the host dwelling's pitched roof. However, the proposal would not be visible from the streetscene or wider area and will be constructed with similar materials to those used for the host dwelling. \r\rWhilst the front/side first-floor extension would be visible from the street, it would be reasonably small in scale and would appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling. The proposal would also be of matching materials to those used in the construction of the host dwelling.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.

    "The application site comprises pavement outside 126 Tolworth Rise and is located within Tolworth District Centre Inset Area and Tolworth Key Area of Change \r\rConsultations\r21 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rTFL response:\r\r- The site forms part of the Transport For London Road Network (TLRN) of which TfL is the highway authority.\rThe proposal  has not demonstrated how the proposal would support the 10 Healthy Streets indicators in line with London Plan Policy T2(d) \r\r- The existing units proposed for removal have static non-illuminated posters. This differs from the two adverts proposed which are larger, taller, illuminated and will face oncoming traffic in both directions on a busy road.\r\r-The proposed unit will be located in close proximity to the Tolworth Roundabout and a signalised pedestrian crossing. TfL has concerns that the unit may pose a potential distraction for drivers.\r\r-The 4 for 1 removal/replacement principle underpins the overall Street Hub roll-out programme, and without the removal of four old kiosks for every new one installed, TfL would object to applications on the grounds of street clutter and impact on amenity and safety terms. \r\r-There is already an existing phone box across the road of the proposed site and another approximately 100 metres away north on the A240 Tolworth Broadway. These can be used in the event that the public need to make calls rather than use their mobile. The need for this many phone kiosks in this area is considered unnecessary.\r\r-There are no plans provided regarding the installation of the Street Hub unit and where vehicles will park/stop during its installation. TfL therefore requests more detail prior to determination.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - No objection\rRBK Transport Officer - No comment received\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on public safety\r\rDesign \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) states that development proposals should avoid locating advertisements and signs where they will be visually intrusive and likely to result in an adverse effect on the character and visual amenities of the local and wider area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed communication hub with internally lit advertisement LCD by virtue of its siting in a prominent position in the public highway and tall appearance would lead to an incongruous addition to the streetscene which would be visually intrusive creating visual street clutter that would detract from the character and appearance of the area.\r\rPublic Safety\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion, on street car parking pressure, or compromise pedestrian or highway safety. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed unit would be set in 3m from Tolworth Broadway, TfL has raised concerns about the close proximity of the unit to the Tolworth Roundabout and a signalised pedestrian crossing. Given the siting of the unit in this location, along with static imaging, it is considered that the unit may pose a potential distraction at a point where driver concentration is critical, thus endangering the safety of those using the crossing and navigating the roundabout, which has multiple lanes and traffic lights\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of either neighbouring properties at No. 146 at No. 150 Somerset Avenue, by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied.

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Given that the rear extension would abut the shared boundary with the adjoining property at no. 211 Raeburn Avenue and it would extend to a depth of 5.7 metres, which is further in depth than is recommended, officers consider that the proposed development would cause an unacceptable overbearing impact, increase in the sense of enclosure and loss of outlook to the adjoining property at no. 211 Raeburn Avenue. \r\rIn terms of loss of daylight, the agent for this application has stated that nearest window to no.213 is to a dining room. However, this \"is secondary source of light\", as there is one more window and a glazed door. The agent has also provided additional floorplans, showing the internal ground floor layout of no. 211 Raeburn Avenue. Officers, therefore conclude that there would be no significant loss of daylight caused to no. 211 Raeburn Avenue, as a result of the proposed development.\r\rIn terms of direct sunlight, the ground floor extension proposed, would be on the North side of the adjoining property at no. 211 Raeburn Avenue. As a result of the location of the proposed extension, there would be no significant loss of direct sunlight caused to the adjoining property at no. 211 Raeburn Avenue. \r\rThere is an existing conservatory extension to the rear of the host property and the proposed extension would only project to a depth of 4.5 metres closest to the boundary with no. 215 Raeburn Avenue and would be set away from no.215.

The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\rNo relevant planning history. \r\rConsultations\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on highways. \rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application partly proposes the construction of a single storey front extension to facilitate a porch. This extension would not dominate the front elevation of the property, and would appear as an original feature. \r\rThe application proposes the construction of a two-storey side extension. This extension would be set back from the front elevation of the property and set down from the ridgeline of the property sufficiently. Furthermore, the extension would not exceed 50% of the width of the original dwellinghouse. Officers note that the proposed extension would not be set in from the boundary by at least 1 metre, instead the development would be set in by approximately 0.5 metres. Whilst not ideal, Officers consider that the proposed side extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, and would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwelling and surrounding area. \r\rFinally the application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would measure a maximum of approximately 4.2 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse, and would have a flat roof measuring approximately 3 metres in height. The application also proposes two lantern lights on the roof of this extension, which would exceed the 3 metres in height. Whilst the proposed extension would exceed the recommended maximum depth as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse. Therefore Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse or area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are No. 51 and No. 55 Sheephouse Way. \r\rIn relation to No. 51 Sheephouse Way, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of this neighbouring property by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn relation to No. 55 Sheephouse Way, regarding sunlight and an overbearing appearance, the primary concern would be the proposed two storey side extension. This neighbouring property benefits from a window at ground floor level, however this appears to facilitate a hallway, which is not considered a habitable room. As the proposed side extension is only set in from the shared boundary by approximately 0.5 metres with this neighbouring property, the proposed development may lead to an overbearing appearance and loss of sunlight to this window. However, given the urban context of the site and the nature of the space served by the windows, Officers consider the proposed development to have an acceptable impact on the neighbouring property in terms of sunlight and an overbearing appearance. \r\rIn relation to privacy, the application proposes one window at first floor level facing the neighbouring property at No. 51 Sheephouse Way. In the event of an approval, Officers consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the permission to ensure that the proposed window would be installed as obscure glazed and retained thereafter. \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the loss of an existing garage. To accommodate modern vehicles, proposed new garages should meet the required dimensions as recommended by Appendix 5 of the Sustainable Transport SPD, measuring 3 metres in width and 5.3 metres in depth internally. The existing garage would not meet the minimum required internal garage dimensions for one vehicle, and therefore the removal of this garage would not impact the parking provision on site.\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling within flood zone 2.\r\rProposal\rErection of single story rear extension\r\rConsultation\rSix neigbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on Flood Risk; and,\r- The impact of the development on Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions) states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies:\r- If the neighbouring house is set at a lower level, the depth of the extension should be reduced.\r- If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r- In all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain.\r- Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth.\r- Extensions with a flat roof should not exceed 3m in height.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would be approximately 3.1m in height with a flat roof and 4.5m in depth. It is noted that the proposed height is not strictly in compliance with the above guidance,  however, officers feel this alone would not warrant refusal Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to be considered in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 37 and No. 41 Thornhill Road. Officers note that No. 41 Thornhill Road already benefits from a 4.5m rear extension. With regards to No. 37 Thornhill Road, due to the separation distance and existing boundary treatment it is not considered the proposed extension would not result in loss of daylight or privacy. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
