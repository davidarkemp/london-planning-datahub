A Ground Movement Assessment must be undertaken and approved by Thames Water, for any new structure which are being constructed within the 45 degree angle of influence from the invert of the Thames Water Ring Main. Once the Ground Movement Assessment has been reviewed and approved by Thames Water, the approval must be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority in consultation with Thames Water within three months of commencing the development.\r\rNotwithstanding the requirements of Condition 28, no piling or subterranean works shall commence on any structure with 30m of the Thames Water Ring Main asset prior to the approval of these details.
