    "The works hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this consent.\r\rReason: As required by Section 18 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.",
    "All existing features shall remain undisturbed in their existing position, and shall be fully protected during the course of works on site unless expressly specified in the approved drawings.\r\rReason: In order that the special architectural and historic interest of this Listed Building is safeguarded.\r",
    "Nil.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would extend 3m in depth, and continue the flat roof form to the rear of the existing side extension, with a parapet roof to the rear of the original dwelling. The height of the proposed rear extension would be within the parameters of the Residential Design Guide SPD.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: As mentioned above the height and depth of the proposed development would be within the recommended parameters of the Residential Design Guide SPD. Given the moderate scale of the proposed development it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. Two small windows are proposed to the side elevation of the proposed development. However, as it would offer similar views to what is existing, this would not contribute to a loss of privacy for the neighbouring property. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\rPlease provide elevations/or brochure showing water tank and a concrete pad with three temporary push walls.",
    "Please provide a copy of block plan scaled 1:500 with a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
