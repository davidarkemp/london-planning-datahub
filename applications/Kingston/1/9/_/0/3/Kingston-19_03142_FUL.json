    "Less than 75% of the floorspace of the proposed habitable accommodation proposed in the converted roofspace would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.3m or more and given this would be the majority of the primary living space of the resultant unit the proposed development would be of a substandard quality and would not comply with the spirit intended of London Plan Policy 3.5 table 3.3 and policy DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed rear dormer by virtue of its size, siting and design would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of and be visually intrusive in the views from the public realm of Church Passage and the private views of the rear of the surrounding properties and would detract from and fail to enhance or preserve the character and appearance of the host property and the Claremont Road Conservation Area it sits within. The proposed development would fail to accord with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r",
