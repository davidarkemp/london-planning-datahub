    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the building shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Condition 5 (Boundary Treatment) - Officers have reviewed the information provided and are satisfied this can now be approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 3 (Hard and Soft Landscaping Scheme), Condition 4 (CO2 Reductions (ENE1) / Internal Water Usage (WAT1) and Condition 5 (Boundary Treatment) of Planning Permission 19/02642/FUL are hereby fully approved.",
    "19 neighbouring properties were consulted. 1 letter of objection was received and their comments are summarised as follows:\rLoss of privacy.\r\rThe application site is located on the eastern side of Chesham Road and comprises a two storey detached property which has been subdivided into 3x self-contained units.\r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character, although the Coombe Road Local Centre is located approximately 15m to the north.\r \rThe buildings on the site are not listed or locally listed and the site does not fall within a Conservation Area. Neither does it have any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on the site or in the immediate vicinity. The site falls within Flood Zone 1. \r\rDuring the course of the application, the applicant submitted amended plans which included removal of the first and second floor side extension, however, the applicant declined to agree to a further extension of time to allow for proper consideration of the plans and instead declared an intention to appeal against non determination. Furthermore, it would not be appropriate to determine the application based on plans that residents have not been consulted on and therefore the application has been determined on the basis of the originally deposited plans. \r\rCharacter and appearance \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: A piggyback roof extension is acceptable in principle, however, the plans of the proposal are inconsistent. The side elevation indicates that the piggyback would be set back approximately 3.7m from the front elevation whereas on the roof plans, it would be set back 4m. It is not clear which option is being proposed. Any proposed piggyback roof extension would need to be in accordance with the requirements of Policy Guidance 40 of the Residential Design SPD (2013) with a minimum set-back from the front elevation of the house of at least 4m.\r\rIn regards to the two  storey side and rear extension, this would add considerable bulk and mass to the existing building when viewed from the street, this is particularly relevant in regards to the side extension which would appear out of keeping with the general pattern and form of development in the area. The proposed development is considered harmful to the character and appearance of the host building and surrounding area. \r\rQuality of accommodation: \r\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant.\r\rPolicies DM10 and DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) expects that all new residential development provides adequate amenities, including in terms of amenity space, outlook, privacy and sunlight/daylight. This is supported by the Mayor's Housing SPD (2016) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy states that appropriate amenity space shall be provided. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD states that 10 sqm of private amenity space should be provided per flat, plus 1sqm per additional occupant. Houses should have 50sqm of private amenity space. Policy Guidance 14 of the SPD states that all new flat development schemes should provide 50sqm of communal amenity space, plus where less than 10sqm of private amenity space is provided per flat, the shortfall in provision should be added to the communal amenity space provision. \r\rOfficer comment: Policy D6 of the London Plan directs that the minimum floor to ceiling height must be 2.5m for at least 75 per cent of the Gross Internal Area (GIA) of each dwelling. It adds that any area with a headroom of less than 1.5m is not counted within the Gross Internal Area unless used solely for storage. The accommodation on the second floor (for flats 2 & 4) would achieve a maximum internal floor to ceiling height of 2.3m. The first floor accommodation for flats 2 & 4 would achieve a ceiling height of 2.5m, however, overall, flat 4 would not meet the minimum internal height requirement for at least 75% of the GIA of that unit and as such the proposed unit would be significantly undersized. Furthermore, no private amenity space provision is made for the new flat. Overall, the proposed new unit would be substandard and provide inadequate living conditions for future occupiers. \r\rImpact on the amenity of neighbouring land and buildings:\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposals to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment The proposed extensions are not considered to result in unacceptable adverse impacts in relation to overshadowing or loss of daylight and given the separation distances between existing and proposed habitable room windows, it is not considered that the proposal would result in significant increase overlooking impacts or cause loss of privacy for editing or future occupiers. \r\rHighway safety and parking: \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe proposed development would not propose any additional off-street car parking spaces.  Given that the application site has a PTAL rating of 4 and is within a controlled parking zone, it is considered that the proposed car-free development could be acceptable as future occupants would have convenient access to public transport. However, this is subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement to prohibit the future owners/occupiers of the proposed flats from obtaining on-street resident parking permits. \r\rIn the absence of a signed legal agreement to prevent occupiers or visitors to the proposed unit from obtaining a residents parking or visitors parking permit to mitigate any parking pressures, the proposed development would not comply with Paragraph 106 of the NPPF, Policy T6 of the London Plan and  Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy  \r\rConclusion Planning balance\r\rThe starting point for any planning decision is Section 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 which requires decisions to be made in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise. The Council cannot at this time demonstrate a five-year housing land supply, accordingly, paragraph 11 d of the Framework is engaged. \r\rThe scheme would provide a net gain of 1 unit which would contribute to the Councils housing supply which carries significant weight in favour of the scheme. Although the benefits of housing are recognised, regard must be had to Paragraph 127 of the National Planning Policy Framework (the Framework) which seeks that developments create places with a high standard of amenity for future users. Officers find harm with regard to the living conditions of future occupiers, as well as harm to the character and appearance to the host dwelling and surrounding area. Furthermore, in the absence of a signed legal agreement, the proposal would exacerbate pressure for on street car parking and prejudice highway safety. These adverse impacts carry substantial weight against the scheme. Thus, the need to boost the supply of housing cannot be to the detriment of the living conditions of future occupiers that would result from the proposal.\r\rThe proposed development is in conflict with the development plan and it is considered that the adverse impacts of granting permission would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the provision of a single flat in this location, when assessed against the policies in the NPPF as a whole. \r",
