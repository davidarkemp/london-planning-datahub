    "CONSULTATIONS: \r1. No objections have been received. \r\r2. Historic England did not consider it necessary for them to be notified.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS: \r3. The application site is located on the southern side of Anglesea Road and comprises of a late 19th Century Grade-II listed building. It is understood that the house was originally built as a stables and coach house for Arundale on Portsmouth Road. However, in the 1920s, internal alterations were made for its use as a single family dwellinghouse. \r\r4. The surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and the site is within close proximity to the River Thames.\r\r5. The site does not fall within a Conservation Area and does not fall within a Flood Risk Zone or have any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on the site or in the immediate vicinity.\r\rPROPOSAL: \r\r6. Listed Building Consent is sought for the replacement of the existing front door to the property. \r\rASSESSMENT: \r\rPrinciple of Development:\r7. The principle of replacing the main entrance door to a residential dwelling within a residential area is acceptable subject to compliance with Development Plan policies and the Planning (listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended).\r\rCharacter and Appearance:\r8. Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states that in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of: \ra) the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;\rb) the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and \rc) the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\r9. Paragraph 199 of the NPPF states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\r10. Section 16, Section 66 and Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990 directs that special attention shall be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of Listed Buildings, their settings and Conservation Areas. This direction is carried through into the Council's Core Strategy. \r\r11. Policy DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy seeks to preserve or enhance existing heritage assets, and allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or setting.\r \r12. The application property is Grade II listed (date of listing: 06/10/1983). The Listing description of the building states the following: \"Later C19. 2 storey house. 4 bays wide. Brown brick, laid in English bond, with stone window dressings. The windows are mostly paired, with chamfered mullions and jambs and shouldered arches. Casement windows. The doorway has a tiled, gabled porch. Patterned tiled roof, gabled over the left-hand bay.\"\r\r13. The application proposal relates solely to the replacement of the existing front entrance door to the property. The existing door is in a state of some disrepair with evidence of warping, shrinkage and splitting of the timber caused by the ingress of water from the base of the door and the uneven, tilted base of the porch.\r\r14. The proposed replacement door would be bespoke to include a frame and fanlight all to match the existing and would be fitted double-glazed units with the original amber leaded glass panels to be retained and fitted to the outside face. \r\rCONCLUSION\r15. The proposed style and appearance of the replacement door is considered to be of a high-quality and to preserve the special character and appearance of the Listed Building, whilst improving thermal performance and security of the property. The proposals are considered to comply with Paragraph 199 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building located on the northern side of Malden Road.\r\rThe site is located in an Area of Archaeological Significance (a non-designated heritage asset).\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a single storey rear extension with associated changes to fenestration.\r \rConsultation \r15  properties were notified of the proposal. One representation was received.  The objection raises concerns that construction work has commenced on site, but does not specify the nature or location of the works. The agent has confirmed in writing that all works on site are internal repair works and time stamped photographs have been submitted. \r\rHistoric England - No consultation considered necessary.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area and heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r   \rCharacter and Appearance and Heritage\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe extension is modest in scale, utilises materials to match the host building and is adequately separated from the rear boundary with 2A Idmiston Road. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and the Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe extension would have modest projection from the rear elevation as it relates to the neighbouring property at No.390 Malden Road and compliance with the 45 degree sunlight/daylight guidance of the SPD has been demonstrated.  The extension by way of its siting is sufficiently separated from any other neighbouring properties and would not have any undue impacts on neighbour amenity.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "PREVIOUS RELEVANT HISTORY \rNone of relevance.\r\rCONSULTATIONS \r5no. neighbouring properties have been consulted and no representations have been received.\rStatutory, Non-Statutory and Internal Consultations: \rNone.\r\rSITE & SURROUNDINGS\rThe site comprises a substantial two storey detached dwelling and is located on the eastern side of Orchard Rise, Kingston.  \rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance consisting of a mix of dwelling style and size.  \rThe site does not contain a Listed Building and is not located within a Conservation Area. However, the site falls within the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rPROPOSAL \rThe application proposes the rendering of the existing brick facing wall to its section facing onto Orchard Rise (to the western side of the site's perimeter) in a white finish. \r\rASSESSMENT \rThe Development Plan sets out that high quality development will be expected, which respects, takes advantage of, and enhances the positive elements and distinctive features of the Borough. \r\rThe main issues for consideration in relation to this application are as follows: \r\rCharacter and Appearance \r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) attaches great importance to the design of the built environment. Paragraph 130 states that permission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area. Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment. \r\rPolicy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments (Including House Extensions) states that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements are identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced and includes the following: \r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area; \r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms), massing; \r- Plot width and format which includes spaces between buildings; \r- Building line build up, set back and front boundary; and \r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and the design detailing of elevations. \r\rPolicy Guidance 44 (Walls and Enclosures) of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013) is most applicable to the proposal. \r\rThe existing section of wall to the western elevation which is presently brick facing. The application proposes to finish the walling and piers to this western section in a white render. It is acknowledged that there are a variety of boundary treatments along Orchard Rise and Coombe Lane West with some exposed brick walls and some examples of rendered boundary treatments. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not detract from the character and appearance of the host dwelling or the surrounding area and would not cause any significant harm or fail to preserve the character and appearance of this strategic area of special character. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would comply with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rRECOMMENDATION \rApprove subject to conditions.\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rIt is noted that one letter of support has been received and there have been no objections received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a sports field and ancillary buildings in the designated Green Belt which is used as a cricket club. The application relates specifically to the existing cricket nets (used for batting and bowling practice/training) which are to be replaced. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle of the development;\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rPrinciple of the development\rThe site is located in the designated Green Belt. Section 13 (Protecting Green Belt Land) of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2021) states that the Government attaches great importance to Green Belts. The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence. Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances.\r\rParagraph 148 of the NPPF (2021) is clear that \"When considering any planning application, local planning authorities should ensure that substantial weight is given to any harm to the Green Belt\".\r\rParagraph 149 of the NPPF (2021) includes a list of certain forms of development which are considered not to be inappropriate in the Green Belt.  In this case, part \"b\" is applicable and states that:\r\"the provision of appropriate facilities (in connection with the existing use of land or a change of use) for outdoor sport, outdoor recreation, cemeteries and burial grounds and allotments; as long as the facilities preserve the openness of the\rGreen Belt and do not conflict with the purposes of including land within it;\"\r\rPolicy G2 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that the strongest protection should be given to London's Green Belt, in accordance with national guidance and inappropriate development should be refused, except in very special circumstances. Policies CS3 and DM5 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) also state that development in the Green Belt will only be supported if it is in accordance with national guidance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal relates to the upgrade of existing sports facilities which would involve the replacement and marginal extension of existing cricket nets with new cricket nets for the continued purpose of practice and training for batting and bowling in association with the primary function of the site a cricket and sports club. The proposal by definition under NPPF paragraph 149 would be considered to be an appropriate form of development in the Green Belt, would preserve its openness and would not conflict with the purposes of including land within it. The principle of the proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy or noise and disturbance.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
