    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer and installation of 2 x rooflights to front roof slope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rAn objection has been raised highlighting possible disturbance during the construction phase of the development. The concerns are acknowledged and it is appreciated that noise impacts would be exacerbated given increased home working currently being undertaken as a result of Covid 19 restrictions. However, all developments will result in short term disruption and it would be unreasonable to prevent a development taking place to try and eliminate all possible disturbance. Moreover, it should be noted that if short term disruption as a result of the construction activities tip over into being a statutory nuisance, the Environmental Health service have powers to control noise / disturbance from a construction site. \r\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension. The extension would be of an irregular shape, would be built on the boundary of the site with No.24 for 4.5m, would be approx. 5.2m wide (spanning the full width of the property) and would have a mono-pitched roof, varying in height from 3.6m at the ridge to 2.7m at the eaves. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
