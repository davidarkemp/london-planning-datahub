    "The Site\r\rThe application site is located on the south-western corner of Ladywood Road and Hamilton Avenue and currently comprises an end-terraced property which features multiple extensions. The site has no specific land allocation or policy constraints within the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rThe character of the area is mixed with two storey post-war semi-detached and terraced properties. The existing property is not listed and the site is not within a conservation area. \r\rConsultations\r\rTwelve neighbouring properties were consulted on the proposed development and five representations were received in relation to the proposal which OBJECT to the application on the grounds that:\r- Car park issues\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Fumes\r- Noise\r\rThe comments in relation to the ongoing development, intensification of the use of the site, parking, and the amenity of neighbours are valid planning concerns which relate to the proposed development. These will therefore be discussed in the consideration of this recommendation. \r\rThe proposed development would be to a dwelling at No 82. It has been stated by a representation that the extension is to No. 82a, a separate entity to the original dwellinghouse. Planning permission was applied for for the creation of this new dwelling, however this was refused in both 2013 (13/10110/FUL) and 2018 (18/10031/FUL). Therefore if this is the case, the dwelling at 82a is liable to enforcement action who will be notified. In addition, there is no history of a planning permission for a basement. \r\rFurthermore, regarding the basement, this element was refused in 2006 (06/10141/FUL), however was later allowed at appeal. \rThe other points raised may be valid concerns, however are not planning related, but are rather dealt with by other departments within the Council. As such they will not be considered in this recommendation. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development.\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the proposed development on highways.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a flat roof first floor extension to the side of the dwellinghouse, above an existing single storey extension. The application also proposes alterations to the roof of an existing rear extension, through the construction of a mansard roof and the installation of rooflights. The application site is located on Ladywood Road and Hamilton Road. As it is situated on a prominent corner plot, any developments are likely to have a significant impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and streetscene. \r\rThe application site has been subject to significant development including the construction of a two storey side extension, a single storey side extension, and a large two storey rear extension. The proposed side extension, and alteration to the roof would significantly increase the height, visual bulk and massing that would represent an incongruous addition to the streetscene. Moreover, in conjunction with the appearance from the side, as well as its location on a prominent junction plot, it is considered that the flank and rear elevations of the two-storey dwellinghouse as extended would further its incongruous appearance within the street scene, appearing overly dominant and intrusive.  \r\rThe further development proposed in this application is a further addition to the erosion of the character and appearance of the original pair of semi-detached properties, in order for the applicant to provide more onsite accommodation. It should also be noted the extensive history of the application site for similar proposals to this, many of which were refused. The currently proposed does not overcome the concerns raised in these previous applications. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rThe proposed development will not lead to any loss of parking provision on site, however it will increase the number of bedrooms of the property to more than four. It is considered that the remaining hardstanding to the front of the site is an adequate level of parking for the property, in line with the maximum standards set out in the London Plan. The proposal would therefore have an acceptable impact on highway safety and congestion. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Conditions 70 (10% Wheelchair Accessible Units) and 75 (Ecological Mitigation Measures) of planning permission 16/10482/FUL are hereby discharged subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "Consultations\r11no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received. \r\rPlanning History\rThe planning history relevant to this planning application is:\r20/00235/FUL - Provision of 2 no. self-contained flats (1 x one-bedroom and 1 x two-bedroom) (C3 use class) over 1st and 2nd floors in conjunction with the change of use from Office (B1 use class) to include the erection of a rear dormer extension to facilitate additional accommodation in roof space. Refused 7th April 2020.\r\r20/00236/FUL - Provision of 2 no. self-contained flats (2 x one-bedroom) (C3 use class) over 1st and 2nd floors in conjunction with the change of use from Office (B1 use class). Refused 7th April 2020. \r\r20/01355/CPU - Change of use from Class A2 (financial and professional services) to a mixed use of Class A2 and two flats (Class C3). Refused 4th August 2020. Appeal Dismissed 11th August 2021. \r\r21/00755/CEU-Continued use of property as Class E(a) Retail Unit (formerly Class A1). Refused 12 November 2021\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of rear roof mansard extension, rear roof terraces, installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope, addition of new door to rear ground floor and change of use of first and second floors from Class E to create 2no. self-contained flats (Use Class C3) and retention of Retail unit on ground floor.\r\rSite & Surroundings\rThe application site relates to a locally listed building on the south side of Clarence Street. The building is three storeys high and is characterised by its end chimneys, coin features and brickwork. The building was occupied until recently by 'Wafflemeister' at ground floor level but is now vacant and separate office / storage use at first and second floor levels.  \r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in character, with commercial and residential use in the vicinity of the site. The site falls within Kingston's Metropolitan Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. \r\rOn-street parking is restricted by the Kingston Town Controlled Parking Zone. The application site has a public transport accessibility level rating of 6a (Excellent).\r\rThe application site is located in Flood Zone 2 (medium probability).\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\r\rThe Principle of Development;\rThe Resultant Standard of Accommodation;\rThe Impact upon the Residential Amenity;\rThe Impact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area (including Heritage Impact); \rThe Impact upon Highway Safety;\rRefuse/Recycling Provision;\rSustainability; and,\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rLoss of Employment / Loss of Ancillary Space\rPolicy CS11 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 seeks to build on the economic strengths of the Borough by promoting the development of a diverse and flourishing economy and ensuring that land and premises are available for both traditional industrial and office based employment activities. \r\rPolicy DM17 of the Council's Core Strategy states that the Council will protect all employment land and premises in certain parts of the Borough. Alternative uses are not considered acceptable unless it has been demonstrated by robust marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. \r\rAs stated above the site is located within Kingston's Metropolitan Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. \r\rOfficers also acknowledge that the site falls within a wider Proposal Site (Site Ref: P2) of the Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008 where the Council will be seeking partial redevelopment, to provide high quality mixed use development to include high quality new comparison shopping facilities, residential (including affordable housing, offices and community uses above the ground floor commercial/retail uses. As this policy document was published in 2008 it should be read in conjunction with the Council's Core Strategy which was adopted in 2012 and which is afforded more weighting, as well as the policies of the London Plan 2021  and the NPPF 2021.\r\rIn previous applications, the upper floors have been shown as (former) B1a (now Class E) office space. This planning application submission no longer shows the upper floors as office space and, instead, it is stated within the supporting Planning Statement that the upper floors are in use as ancillary storage space. Officers note from independent research in the form of marketing particulars for the property and from previous planning application submissions by way of photographs submitted by the planning agents (taken on 22 October 2019) that the upper floor is clearly in use as an office space by a business, indicating that this employment use is viable. \r\rThere is inconsistency as to the true use of the upper floors. Officers note that the upper floors have independent means of access from the rear up to the first and second floors and Officers cannot be sufficiently satisfied that the upper floors have been in sole use as ancillary storage/office space in connection with the ground floor commercial unit. \r\rNo robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the property has been marketed in accordance with Policy DM17. As such, it has not been demonstrated that there is no longer a need for employment office use at this location. Additionally, given that the ground floor unit is currently vacant and its existing lawful use is not clear, it is not clear whether the upper floors would be surplus to associated office/ancillary requirements for a new occupier to the ground floor unit.\r\rIn light of the above, Officers cannot take a different view from that held by Officers in previous iterations and it is considered that the proposal would adversely impact on the provision of employment and office uses in the Borough contrary to Policy DM17 of the Core Strategy.    \r\rStandard of Accommodation \rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                                           \rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe application seeks to provide two flats, that is 1 x 1-bedroom, 2-person flat on the first floor and 1 x 2-bedroom, 4-person flat arranged over the second and third floors flats, for which Policy D6 of the London Plan would require Gross Internal Areas (GIA) of 50sqm and 79sqm respectively. The proposed internal floor space measures 56sqm for the first floor flat and 83sqm for the duplex unit. \r\rFlat 1 would not be provided with any private amenity space. Flat 2 would have an external terrace measuring in total 10 square metres on the second floor and an additional terrace to the third floor measuring approximately 7sqm. \r\rAs such, the proposal would not provide future occupants with adequate external amenity space, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013. \r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed dormer extension would be set within the rear roof slope of the host building. As such, it is considered that it would not cause undue harm to the living conditions of neighbouring residential occupiers, in terms of sense of enclosure or overbearing effect. The proposed terraces at second floor and third floors would mainly provide views of the rooftops of neighbouring properties and the side wall of No.59 Eden Street (which is in commercial use). As such, the proposal would not result in an unreasonable loss of privacy for neighbouring residential occupiers.\r\rImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rThe proposed front rooflights would be conservation-type rooflights and the proposed rear dormer would be set-in from the sides by approximately 1.9 metres and marginally set-below the ridgeline of the host building. Due to its limited size, and pitched roof form, it is considered that the proposed dormer extension would appear as a subservient addition when read against the rear roof slope. Moreover, it is considered that the proposed external alterations would appear sympathetic to the architectural style of the host building. \r\rDue to the position of the building, the proposed rear dormer extension and external alterations to the rear elevation would not be readily visible from public vantage points. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the locally listed building and the surrounding area, in accordance with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rImpact upon Heritage \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rThe application property is a locally-listed building and is characterised by its end chimneys and coin brickwork. The proposed changes to the rear elevation involve the erection of a dormer roof extension to the rear roofslope, replacement of the second floor window with French doors and the installation of two terraces to the rear elevation. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed works would not result in material harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. \r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 6a (excellent). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all areas of London with a PTAL 6 should be car-free. It is considered that a car free development could be acceptable as future occupants would have convenient access to public transport.\r\rThe site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) - Zone A and A1 Kingston Town Centre. As no off-street parking would be provided, the proposed development would meet the requirements in terms of maximum parking provision. \r\rHowever, this is subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement to prohibit the future owners/occupiers of the proposed flats from obtaining on-street resident parking permits. \r\rTable 10.2 of the London Plan (2021) sets a minimum cycle parking provision of 1.5 spaces 1-bed, 2-person unit and 2 spaces per all other sized units above.\r\rParagraph 2.73 of the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD states that cycle storage identified in habitable rooms or on balconies would not be acceptable. It is noted from the submitted planning, design and access statement that the cycle storage would be stored within habitable rooms, which would not be compliant with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD. \r\rBased on the constrained nature of the site and building, and as per the previous assessment, it is questioned whether the cycle parking provision could be accommodated in an accessible and convenient location to promote usage by occupiers. \r\rThe proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013. \r\rRefuse / Recycling\rIf planning permission were to be granted, a condition would be secured requiring a refuse and recycling management plan to be submitted for the approval of the Council. This is to ensure compliance with Policies CS9 and DM10 part s) of the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rSustainability\rPolicy DM3 of the Council's Core Strategy states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure an energy efficiency standard of 35% of CO2 improvement over Building Regulations Part L (2013), which is secured by an appropriately worded condition. Similarly, a condition is required to secure the required level of water efficiency.\r\rContribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 2 with a charge of £130 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, Officers consider that the proposals have not overcome previous concerns raised by Officers.\rThe proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the Sustainable Transport SPD (2013). \r\rOfficers give significant weight to the proposal's positive contribution towards the Borough's housing supply. However, it is acknowledged that only two flats would be provided. As such, the proposal's positive contribution to the Borough's housing stock and the associated social benefits it would bring to the community would be somewhat limited. \r\rThe proposal would adversely impact on the provision of employment and office uses in the Borough, contrary to Policy DM17 of the Council's Core Strategy. One of the proposed flats would not provide future occupants with a satisfactory provision of external amenity space, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Inadequate cycle storage is provided to serve the proposed development, contrary to Policies D3 and T5 of the London Plan 2021 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD (2013). In the absence of a signed legal agreement, the proposal would exacerbate pressure for street parking and prejudice highway safety contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy. \r\rThe proposal would have an acceptable impact on character and appearance of the area and impact upon the non-designated heritage asset which is a neutral matter. The loss of employment and office floorspace is given significant weight. Officers attach significant weight to the proposed lack of amenity space provided to residents of the first floor flat (Flat 1). \r\rOfficers apply moderate weight to the inadequate cycle parking provision for the development and to the pressures to on-street car parking by virtue of the absence of a signed legal agreement to restrict car parking permits for future residents. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the adverse impacts of the proposal would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.\r",

Appeal Dismissed 11th August 2021. \r\r21/00755/CEU-Continued use of property as Class E(a) Retail Unit (formerly Class A1). Refused-12 November 2021\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of rear roof mansard extension, rear roof terrace, front roof dormer, addition of new door to rear ground floor, internal cycle storage and change of use of upper floors from Class E to create 3no. self-contained flats. \r\rSite & Surroundings\rThe application site relates to a locally listed building on the south side of Clarence Street. The building is three storeys high and is characterised by its end chimneys, coin features and brickwork. The building has until recently been occupied by 'Wafflemeister' at ground floor level (now vacant) and separate office / storage use at first and second floor levels.  \r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in character, with commercial and residential use in the vicinity of the site. The site falls within Kingston's Metropolitan Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. \r\rOn-street parking is restricted by the Kingston Town Controlled Parking Zone. The application site has a public transport accessibility level rating of 6a (Excellent).\r\rThe application site is located in Flood Zone 2 (medium probability).\r\rPlanning Assessment\rThe key considerations in the assessment of this application are:\rThe Principle of Development;\rThe Resultant Standard of Accommodation;\rThe Impact upon the Residential Amenity;\rThe Impact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area (including Heritage Impact); \rThe Impact upon Highway Safety;\rRefuse/Recycling Provision;\rSustainability;and,\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy (CIL).\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rLoss of Employment / Loss of Ancillary Space\rPolicy CS11 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 seeks to build on the economic strengths of the Borough by promoting the development of a diverse and flourishing economy and ensuring that land and premises are available for both traditional industrial and office based employment activities. \r\rPolicy DM17 of the Council's Core Strategy states that the Council will protect all employment land and premises in certain parts of the Borough. Alternative uses are not considered acceptable unless it has been demonstrated by robust marketing over a number of years (up to two years) that there is no quantitative or qualitative need for a range of employment uses. \r\rAs sated above the site is located within Kingston's Metropolitan Town Centre and a designated Primary Shopping Area. \r\rOfficers also acknowledge that the site is within a wider Proposal Site (Site Ref: P2) of the Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008 where the Council will be seeking partial redevelopment, to provide high quality mixed use development to include high quality new comparison shopping facilities, residential (including affordable housing, offices and community uses above the ground floor commercial/retail uses.  As this policy document was published in 2008 it should be read in conjunction with the Council's Core Strategy which was adopted in 2012 and which is afforded more weighting, as well as the policies of the London Plan 2021 and the NPPF 2021.\r\rIn previous applications, the upper floors have been shown as (former) B1a (now Class E) office space. This planning application submission no longer shows the upper floors as office space and, instead, it is stated within the supporting Planning Statement that the upper floors are in use as ancillary storage space. Officers note from independent research in the form of marketing particulars and from previous planning application submissions by way of photographs submitted by the planning agents (taken on 22 October 2019) that the upper floors are clearly in use as an office space by a business, indicating that this employment use is viable. \r\rThere is inconsistency as to the true use of the upper floors. Officers note that the upper floors have independent means of access from the rear up to the first and second floors and Officers cannot be sufficiently satisfied that the upper floors have been in sole use as ancillary storage/office space in connection with the ground floor commercial unit. \r\rNo robust evidence has been submitted to indicate that the property has been marketed in accordance with Policy DM17. As such, it has not been demonstrated that there is no longer a need for employment office use at this location. Additionally, given that the ground floor unit is currently vacant and its existing lawful use is not clear, it is not clear whether the upper floors would be surplus to associated office/ancillary requirements for a new occupier to the ground floor unit.\r\rIn light of the above, Officers cannot take a different view from that held by Officers in previous iterations and it is considered that the proposal would adversely impact on the provision of employment and office uses in the Borough contrary to Policy DM17 of the Core Strategy.    \r\rStandard of Accommodation \rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy (2012) reiterates the requirement for adequately sized properties. \r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).                                           \rWith regards to private amenity space, Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that where there are no higher local standards in the borough Development Plan Documents, a minimum of 5sqm of private outdoor space should be provided for 1-2 person dwellings and an extra 1sqm should be provided for each additional occupant. Policy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) sets a higher minimum standard of 50sqm of private garden space per family house i.e. three bedrooms (where the prevailing character of the area allows) and 10sqm of private garden space for new flats. \r\rThe application seeks to provide three 1-bedroom flats laid over first, second and third floors, for which Policy D6 of the London Plan would require Gross Internal Areas (GIA) of 39sqm or 50sqm (depending on whether 1-person or 2-person occupancy). The proposed internal floor space measures between 43sqm - 56sqm. Unit 2 arranged on the second floor would be undersized for a 1-bed, 2-person unit providing a deficit of floorspace of 7sqm, resulting in a poor standard of accommodation.\r\rFlat 1 and Flat 3 would not be provided with any private amenity space. Flat 2 would have an external terrace measuring in total 10 square metres. As such, the proposal would not provide future occupants with adequate external amenity space, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013.\r\rImpact upon Residential Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed dormer extension would be set within the front and rear roof slope of the host building. As such, it is considered that it would not cause undue harm to the living conditions of neighbouring residential occupiers, in terms of sense of enclosure or overbearing effect. The proposed terrace at second floor and Juliet balcony at third floor would mainly provide views of the rooftops of neighbouring properties and the side wall of No.59 Eden Street (which is in commercial use). As such, the proposal would not result in an unreasonable loss of privacy for neighbouring residential occupiers.\r\rImpact upon the Character and Appearance of the Area\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rThe proposed front and rear dormer extensions would be set-in from the sides by approximately 1.9 metres and marginally set-below the ridgeline of the host building. Due to its limited size, and pitched roof form, it is considered that the proposed dormer extensions would appear as a subservient addition when read against the front and rear roof slope. Moreover, it is considered that the proposed external alterations would appear sympathetic to the architectural style of the host building. \r\rDue to the position of the building, the proposed rear dormer extension and external alterations to the rear elevation would not be readily visible from public vantage points. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the locally listed building and the surrounding area, in accordance with Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rImpact upon Heritage \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rThe application property is a locally-listed building and is characterised by its end chimneys and coin brickwork. The proposed changes to the rear elevation involve an erection of a dormer roof extension to the front roofslope, a roof extension to the rear roofslope, replacement of the second floor window with French doors and the installation of one terrace and one Juliet balcony to the rear elevation. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposed works would not result in material harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset. \r\rImpact upon Highway Safety\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 6a (excellent). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all areas of London with a PTAL 6 should be car-free. It is considered that a car free development could be acceptable as future occupants would have convenient access to public transport.\r\rThe site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) - Zone A and A1 Kingston Town Centre. As no off-street parking would be provided, the proposed development would meet the requirements in terms of maximum parking provision. However, this is subject to the applicant entering into a legal agreement to prohibit the future owners/occupiers of the proposed flats from obtaining on-street resident parking permits. \r\rTable 10.2 of the London Plan (2021) sets a minimum cycle parking provision of one space per 1-bed, 1-person unit and 1.5 spaces per 1-bed, 2-person unit. \r\rParagraph 2.73 of the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD states that cycle storage identified in habitable rooms or on balconies would not be acceptable. It is noted from the submitted planning, design and access statement that the cycle storage would be stored within habitable rooms, which would not be compliant with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 and given the deficit in floorspace of one of the flats this is considered to further diminish the standard of living accommodation.  \r\rBased on the constrained nature of the site and building, it is questioned whether the cycle parking provision could be accommodated in an accessible and convenient location to promote usage by occupiers. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD. \r\rRefuse / Recycling\rIf planning permission were to be granted, a condition would be secured requiring a refuse and recycling management plan to be submitted for the approval of the Council. This is to ensure compliance with Policies CS9 and DM10 part s) of the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rSustainability\rPolicy DM3 of the Council's Core Strategy states that design proposals should incorporate climate change adaptation measures based on the type and extent of the main changes expected in the local climate throughout the lifetime of the development, this is likely to require a flexible design that can be adapted to accommodate the changing climate, e.g. provision of additional shading or cooling.\r\rThe proposed dwellings would be required to secure an energy efficiency standard of 35% of CO2 improvement over Building Regulations Part L (2013), which is secured by an appropriately worded condition. Similarly, a condition is required to secure the required level of water efficiency.\r\rContribution to Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL)\rAs of the 1st November 2015 the Council commenced the operation of a Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) as a means of collecting monies to provide local infrastructure to offset the impact of developments. This replaced the S106 mechanism for collecting contributions for local infrastructure e.g. education and health with the exception of affordable housing. For the avoidance of doubt S106 contributions can only be collected to resolve site specific issues as a result of the proposed development.\r\rFor Kingston CIL purposes, the proposed development is located within CIL Zone 2 with a charge of £130 per square metre of residential development. \r\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The CIL charges are subject to the national Tender Price Index. In the event that the All-in Tender Price Index ceases to be published, the index referred to is the retail prices index; and the figure for a given year is the figure for November of the preceding year.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, Officers consider that the proposals have not overcome previous concerns raised by Officers.\rThe proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the Sustainable Transport SPD (2013). \r\rOfficers give significant weight to the proposal's positive contribution towards the Borough's housing supply. However, it is acknowledged that only three, 1-bed flats would be provided. As such, the proposal's positive contribution to the Borough's housing stock and the associated social benefits it would bring to the community would be somewhat limited. \r\rThe proposal would adversely impact on the provision of employment and office uses in the Borough, contrary to Policy DM17 of the Council's Core Strategy. One of the three flats would not be provided with satisfactory internal living accommodation by virtue of the deficit in floorspace against minimum floorspace standards as set out in Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021. The proposed flats would not provide future occupants with a satisfactory provision of external amenity space, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Inadequate cycle storage is provided to serve the proposed development, contrary to Policies D3 and T5 of the London Plan 2021 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD (2013). In the absence of a signed legal agreement, the proposal would exacerbate pressure for street parking and prejudice highway safety contrary to Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy. \r\rThe proposal would have an acceptable impact on character and appearance of the area and impact upon the non-designated heritage asset which is a neutral matter. Officers attach significant weight to the poor quality residential accommodation in terms of undersized accommodation for one of the proposed flats and the lack of amenity space provided to residents. Officers apply moderate weight to the inadequate cycle parking provision for the development and to the pressures to on-street car parking by virtue of the absence of a signed legal agreement to restrict car parking permits for future residents.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the adverse impacts of the proposal would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat planning permission be REFUSED.\r",
