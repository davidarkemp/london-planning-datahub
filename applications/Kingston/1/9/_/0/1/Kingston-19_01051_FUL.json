    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \r\rNo response received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed roof extension would be an incongruous addition to the host property that would unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties it forms part of which currently have a hipped roof form on both properties. \r\rWhilst it is acknowledged that the applicant has cited an example of a similar proposal in the vicinity of the site to the rear on Ashcroft Road it is considered that this does not appear to be the prevailing character and appearance of the roofscapes in this area which are predominantly of a hipped form. \r\rThe development at Ashcroft Road cited has been carried out under permitted development which does not assess impact on character and appearance and whilst it is acknowledged there may be some form of fall back position in terms of the possibility of a similar development at the application site it is considered that given the context of its surroundings the proposal would create an unwanted precedent and in turn it is considered that the harm caused to the character and appearance of the area as a result of the proposal would outweigh any fall back posiion in this regard. \r\rIt is considered that the propsal would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r",
    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans/documents submitted for the purposes of this application are consistent with the parent planning permission reference 20/02942/FUL, however, any inconsistencies would be resolved in favour of the parent permission. An Application for Approval of Details Reserved by Condition should not be used to evolve or modify the scheme in a way that is substantially different from that set out in the application.",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation\r\rOne objection received. The objection can be summarised as follows\r\r - Access or traffic problems\r - Car park issues\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Housing Delivery; \r- Quality of accommodation;\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- Highways; and\r-any other matters\r\rHousing Delivery \rThe proposal would result in the net increase of one self contained 3 bed unit. The borough does not have a 5 year housing supply and the proposal would assist in the borough meeting its year on year target of 964 new homes over a 10 year period as set by Table 4.1 Policy H1 of the London Plan. \r\rQuality of accommodation\rThe proposed accommodation of the new unit would comply with the internal space standards required by Policy D6 of the London Plan Policy and is of a practical layout. The proposal would provide sufficient outdoor private amenity space for the future occupants of the proposed new unit of accommodation in line with the Council's adopted LDF Resdiential Design Guide. \r\rThe applicant however has not demonstrated that the reduction in floorspace to the host donor property would not result in the internal floorspace falling below the minimum threshold for a 2 bed dwellinghouse set by Policy D6 of the London Plan. It would appear based on the information submitted that the donor property would be reduced to an internal floorspace below 70sqm and as such would result in the reduction in the standard of accommodation at the donor host property and be substandard to the minimum London Plan Policy D6 required for a 2bed 3p unit.   \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed building would not be a subordinate addition to the host property and the terrace in which it would form part of. \r\rThe proposed first floor would extend in excess of 3metres beyond the rear building line of the host property and that of the rear building line of the terrace which it forms part of. It would create a dominant and overbearing feature at the rear and would be visually intrusive in the private views of the site from the rear of the neighbouring properties as a result of its its size, height and projection. \r\rIn addition, due to the gap in the run of properties between 150 and 152 Gilders Road there would be  large expanse of blank elevation visible in the streetscene. Coupled with the height of the elevation being exacerbated by the gable finish, it is considered that the proposed side flank would appear overly dominant in the streetscene and create an incongruous addition to the host porperty. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed extensions as such would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would by virtue of its size, siting and design create an unecessary sense of enclosure at the rear to the neighbouring properties notably the donor site 150 Gilders Road and result in a loss of daylight/sunlight to the detriment of the neighbouring occupiers living conditions. \r\rHighways \r\rThe proposed development would utilise an existing access road to the rear and off street parking would be provided in line with Policy T6.1 of the Lodon Plan for the existing and future unit proposed on the site. In addition a suitable level of cycle parking would be provided. Both off street parking and cycle parking could be secured by condition. \r\rThe LPA's highways neighbourhood traffic engineer has reviewed the proposal and found it to be acceptable and raise no objection to the proposal.\r\rWhilst it is acknowledged that there may be 'but not proven' parking pressures as stated by the objector within the area it is considered that sufficient parking provision off street is provided for the proposed development and that in this instance there is not a necessity for any further mitgation measures to be imposed such as the requirement for occupants to sign and complete a legal agreement to preclude future occupants and their vistors applying and obtaining an on street parking permit should a future CPZ scheme come forward in the area. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development in itself would not increase demand for on street parking or lead to congestion or prejudice highway safety. \r\rOther matters\r\rIt is noted that the applicants description of development omitted the fact that alterations and extensions and a sub division of the plot of the donor host property are proposed. However the LPA's assessment has taken these factors into consideration in making its assessment. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.
