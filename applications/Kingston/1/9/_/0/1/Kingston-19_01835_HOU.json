    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r        \t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time be placed in the side elevation of the building/extension hereby permitted without the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r \rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on the Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- The impact on Parking\r\r2 comments have been received in response to the public consultation 1 Objection (CAAC) 1 Neutral\r\rThe CAAC have objected to the proposal on the following material planning grounds\r\rThis PA for no.8 would further erode the original integrity of this development. The conversion of the existing garage & insertion of new windows to the front side would result in the loss of mature landscaping to the existing elevation & be highly visible from the street\r\rA neighbour has made the following Neutral comment\r\rOur concern is that after planning permission has been granted the applicants may decide to move the fence further along to  enclose the 2nd converted garage into the garden thus removing their only off street parking space and reducing the accessibility to the off street parking for the garages for 14 and 16 Albany Mews.\r\rAssessment \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. The changes to the rear would overlook a parking area with limited public views and the alterations to the front would not project forward of the building line. Whilst the comments of the CAAC are noted, they do not provide any information with regards to how they consider the proposal would harm the significance of the Conservation Area (Riverside North). The Designation Summary of the Conservation Area is as follows\r\rThe special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as:- A linear area whose form and mature landscape is influenced by the River Thames, alongside which lie ancient riverside estates, important 19th century public works that established Canbury Gardens, a group of large Victorian/Edwardian houses and late Victorian boathouses fronting the river\r\rThe proposed works, subject to the imposition of conditions, would be respectful of the host property and to the wider area, as such, Officers conclude that the development would not harm the significance of the Conservation Area and would be acceptable in design terms.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rWith regards to parking - the comments of the neighbour are noted and a condition removing permitted development rights to erecting boundary fencing has been imposed. Moreover, sufficent parking space remains to accomodate off street parking. Given that the garage would be removed replacement cycle parking would be secured by way of a planning condition.\r\rThe comments of the CAAC are noted, however, no landscaping is proposed to be removed. Notwithstanding, a landscaping condition has been imposed to secure extra planting.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.                                              \r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area or harm to the heritage asset as a result of the proposed development preserving the overall character and appearance of the Riverside North Conservation Area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
