    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with details and samples for all facing materials which shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning authority before any works above ground level are commenced. The development shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples and completed prior to occupation. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall not commence until a Sustainable Drainage Strategy and associated detailed design, management and maintenance plan of surface water drainage for the site using SUDs methods has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The approved drainage system shall be implemented in accordance with the approved Sustainable Drainage Strategy prior to the first occupation of the development and maintained thereafter for the lifetime of the development. \r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to prevent the increased risk of flooding by ensuring the provision of a satisfactory means of surface water disposal is incorporated into the design and the build of the proposed development, in accordance with Policies 5.2 and 5.3 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM1 of the Core Strategy Adopted (2012).\r",

The statement shall provide for:\r(a) Provision for loading/unloading materials.\r(b) Storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles.\r(c) Temporary site access.\r(d) Signing system for works traffic.\r(e) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works.\r(f) Location of all ancillary site buildings.\r(g) Measures to protect any tree, shrubbery and other landscape features to be retained on the site during the course of development.\r(h) Means of enclosure of the site.\r(i) Wheel washing equipment. \r(j) The parking of vehicles of the site operatives and visitors\r(k) The erection and maintenance of security hoarding.\rThe demolition and construction of the development shall be carried out in accordance with the construction method statement so agreed.\r\rNo development shall take place including any works of demolition until a construction management plan or construction method statement has been submitted to and been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved plan/statement shall be adhered to throughout the construction period. \r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "No work relating to the development hereby approved, including works of demolition or preparation prior to building operations, shall take place other than between the hours of 08:00 and 18:00 Monday to Friday and 08:00 to 13:00 Saturdays and at no time on Sundays or Bank or National Holidays. \r\rReason: To protect the occupiers of neighbouring properties from noise and disturbance outside the permitted hours during the construction period, in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

The approved scheme shall be implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority. Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only. \r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Prior to the occupation of the approved development, a plan shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority indicating the positions, design, materials and type of all gates, boundary treatment, fences and means of enclosures to be erected.  The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plan before the building is occupied.\r\rReason:  To safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and in the interest of visual amenity, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the  Core Strategy Adopted (2012).\r",
    "The vehicle parking space shown on the approved plans shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the first occupation of development and shall thereafter be retained for this use at all times. \r\rReason: To ensure adequate on-site parking provision in the interests of highway safety, convenience and amenity, in accordance with CS7 (Managing Vehicle Use) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012; \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012; and,\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a ground floor restaurant/takeaway on the northern side of Clarence Street and falls within Kingston's Metropolitan Town Centre.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks alterations to the existing shopfront.\r\rConsultations\r18 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rHistoric England GLAAS - No comment.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issue in the assessment of the application is the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe principal changes to the shopfront would involve the removal of the existing stallriser and timber cladding to the piers and fascia and the installation of black mesh cladding. The entrance doors would also be relocated from their current central position to the left hand side of the shopfront. \r\rOfficers consider that these changes would provide a slightly more active frontage and would integrate comfortably with surrounding shopfronts. Overall, officers consider that the proposed development would result in a higher quality shopfront than the existing and that the impact on the character and appearance of the area would be positive.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have a positive impact on the character and appearance of the area. This carries significant weight in favour of the proposal.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises \r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- RBK Core Strategy 2012;\r- Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The proposal is to subdivide the plot and erect a detached dwelling house. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- Quality & mix of accommodation; and, \r- Parking impacts .\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would respect the scale, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design of the surrounding area. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rQuality and mix of accommodation \r\rParagraph 127 of the NPPF states that planning policies and decisions should create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and wellbeing, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users. \r\rAccordingly, Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 requires boroughs to seek to ensure that new development reflects the above standards. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rThe proposal would meet the London Plan minimum internal space standards for a 3 bedroom 4 person unit. The dwelling would have a functional, dual aspect layout and would be provided with at least 50 square metres of external amenity space, whilst 50 sqm would be retained for the existing dwellinghouse at No. 66.  The quality of accommodation is considered to be acceptable.  \r\rParking & Sustainable transport \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a PTAL score of 1a/1b(poor). Policy T6 directs a maximum 1.5 spaces per dwelling. The existing off-street car parking spaces, accessed via an existing crossover would be re-allocated to the new house. The Council's Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer has raised no objections to this arrangement and agrees that there is sufficient on-street parking to accommodate two additional car parking spaces that may be required for the existing house. \r\rTwo cycle spaces would be provided within the timber store adjacent to the proposed house which would comply with Policy T5 of the London Plan. The store would also contain the waste receptacles. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Conditions are proposed to ensure upper floor flank windows are obscure glazed and fixed shut. Furthermore, given the resulting plot sizes, it is considered necessary to remove permitted development rights for extensions/outbuildings to prevent overdevelopment, adverse impacts to neighbours and ensure adequate amenity areas. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r",
    "The Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any\radjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r(i) carry out work to an existing party wall;\r(ii) build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r(iii) in some circumstances, carry out groundwork's within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.

    "Thames Water advise that if the developer proposes to discharge to a public sewer, prior approval from Thames Water Developer Services will be required. They also advise that Thames Water will aim to provide customers with a minimum pressure of 10m head (approx 1 bar) and a flow rate of 9 litres/minute at the point where it leaves Thames Waters pipes. The developer should take account of this minimum pressure in the design of the proposed development.\r",
    "The Environment Agency offer the following advice to applicant with respect to piling, disposal of contaminated soil and prevention of pollution incidents:\r(i) Piling can result in risks to groundwater quality by mobilising contamination when boring through different bedrock layers and creating preferential pathways. Thus it should be demonstrated that any proposed piling will not result in contamination of groundwater. If Piling is proposed, a Piling Risk\rAssessment must be submitted, written in accordance with EA guidance document \"Piling and Penetrative Ground Improvement Methods on Land Affected by Contamination: Guidance on Pollution Prevention. National Groundwater & Contaminated Land Centre report NC/99/73\".\r(ii) Disposal of contaminated soils\rContaminated soil that is (or must be) disposed of is waste. Therefore, its handling, transport, treatment\rand disposal are subject to waste management legislation, which includes:\r. Duty of Care Regulations 1991\r. Hazardous Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2005\r. Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016\r. The Waste (England and Wales) Regulations 2011\rDevelopers should ensure that all contaminated materials are adequately characterised both chemically and physically in line with British Standard BS EN 14899:2005 'Characterization of Waste - Sampling of\rWaste Materials - Framework for the Preparation and Application of a Sampling Plan' and that the permitting status of any proposed treatment or disposal activity is clear. If in doubt, the Environment Agency should be contacted for advice at an early stage to avoid any delays.\rIf the total quantity of hazardous waste material produced or taken off-site is 500kg or greater in any 12 month period, the developer will need to register with us as a hazardous waste producer. Refer to the hazardous waste pages on gov.uk for more information.\r(iii) Prevention of silts and sediments, debris entering the watercourse\rMitigation has been proposed to intercept silts and sediments such as a catchpit however we recommend mitigation provisions are provided during construction phase also. Silts entering a watercourse (where it\ris in close proximity to the development site or designated drainage network discharges into the river) isa common occurrence and therefore all measures must be taken to avoid sediment pollution and altering the sediment regime of a watercourse.\r(iv) Flood Risk Activity Permit [FRAP]\rUnder the Environmental Permitting (England and Wales) Regulations 2016, you must submit plans to the Environment Agency and apply for a FRAP if you want to do work:\r.
