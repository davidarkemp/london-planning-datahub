    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling within the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character.\r\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rOfficers note that an application for a similar development has previously been refused on this site (16/14258/HOU dated 05.05.2016). The reason for refusal related to the size and bulk of the proposed rear dormer. However, since that time it is considered that the site context has since changed due to the number of properties in the area that have benefited from extensions and alterations that have resulted in a greater variation in roof types within the streetscene.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: As stated above Officers note similar permissions have been granted which have resulted in a greater variation in roof types within the streetscene, notably No.48 Overdale Avenue (19/02470/HOU granted 04/12/2019) and No.52 Overdale Avenue (16/14043/HOU granted 10/03/2016). As such, the proposed development would not be out of character with properties in the surrounding area. In addition, the proposed development would not be unduly excessive in scale and would integrate well with the existing main roof.  As such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The application site falls within Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area\r\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one objection has been received relating to design, loss of light/sunlight and construction noise. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\rConcerns relating to construction noise  is not relevant to the assessment of this application. However construction noise will be controlled by an informative attached to any planning permission. \r\rKingston Town Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC) - lack of detail but proposes traditional sash windows to any new and current windows. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The single storey wraparound extension would replace the existing rear store and extend to a depth of similar to what is existing. The infill extension would have a flat glass roof, and as it would not extend further than the existing side elevation, it would not be viewed from the streetscene. The second storey rear extension would extend to the same depth as the proposed ground floor rear extension, approx 3.27m, and be no wider than the existing second storey rear projection. The roof form of the two storey rear extension would be in keeping with the original dwelling, and be in materials that would be in keeping with the host property.\r\rThe proposed alterations to the side elevation include a window to the ground floor, and an obscured glazed and non openable (above 1.7m from the floor level) window to the first floor and one door at ground floor level. The proposed siting of the windows and door are considered acceptable, the design would match what is existing.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The two storey rear extension would be built up to the boundary with No. 21 Caversham Road, however due to the siting of the extension in relation to the neighbouring property, there would not be an adverse effect on the amenities of the neighbouring property in respect to loss of light/sunlight or undue overbearing. The rear infill extension would maintain the existing separation gap between No. 17 Caversham Road and therefore would also not have an adverse effect on loss of light/sunlight or undue overbearing.\r\rIt is noted that the proposed openings on the side elevation would not result in loss of privacy or undue overlooking in relation to the adjoining property as they would be obscured glazed and non openable above 1.7m from the floor level.\r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
    "Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: :The significance of the Fairfield / Knights Park Conservation Area is as an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre. It contains houses of various sizes and designs, dating mainly from 1820 to 1900 and focused around Fairfield Recreation Ground, which has been a recreational open space since 1855. The two closest heritage assets are Grade II listed Kingston Grammar School which is approximately 71m to the west and the Grade II* listed Lovekyn Chapel approximately 123m to the north-west of the application site. The proposed extension would be proportionate to the host property, would be in keeping with the appropriate materials and would not be visible within the street scene. The proposal is sufficiently set away from nearby listed buildings such that there would be no direct adverse impact or harm to their settings. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed extension would preserve the appearance of the Conservation Area.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
