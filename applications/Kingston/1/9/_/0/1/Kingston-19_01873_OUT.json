    "The proposed footprint and siting of the development, including the lightwells associated with the front elevation would leave insufficient space fronting Villiers Avenue to provide adequate soft landscaping which would result in an incongruous appearance from the streetscape, thereby conflicting with Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8, DM10, and DM11 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development has failed to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types to meet the identified housing needs of the Borough. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the delivery of 30% of the units as family units would be unsuitable or unviable. As such, the development is contrary to Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 3 (Materials, colour and texture of the external finish of the building) and Condition 4 (Window reveals, door reveals, overhangs, rainwater goods) of planning permission 19/03090/FUL are hereby fully approved.\r\r",
    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012; \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012; and,\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008.",
    "The site comprises a detached bungalow.\r\rThe application seeks the demolition of the existing bungalow and erection of a two storey replacement dwelling.\r\r17 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. 2 objections and 1 neutral comment were received. The material issues raised were as follows:\r- Design;\r- Height and bulk;\r- Roof form; and,\r- Sustainability.\r\rOfficer response: These matters will be considered below.\r\rThe key issues in the assessment of this application are:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of the proposed accommodation;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- The impact of the development on the transport network.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe application site is within a residential area and its use for residential purposes is well established. It is not subject to any designations or environmental constraints that fundamentally conflict with the proposal. The principle of the development is therefore considered to be acceptable.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan 2021 requires boroughs to seek to ensure that new development reflects the Government's technical housing standards. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have a minimum of 50m2 of private garden (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows. Each new flat should have 10m2 (plus an extra 1m2 for each occupant after the first). \r\rThe proposed dwelling would comfortably exceed the requirements of the technical housing standards and future occupants would enjoy a good outlook to the front and rear of the site, as well as a generous garden which would greatly exceed the requirements of Policy Guidance 13. Officers therefore consider the standard of the proposed accommodation to be acceptable.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed dwelling would respect the established forward building line on Beechcroft Avenue and would match the eaves height of the adjacent property No. 63 Beechcroft Avenue, with the ridge sitting slightly lower. Although the dimensions of the proposed bays and the roof pitch would differ from other properties in the immediate vicinity, the design is nevertheless sensitive to surrounding development and is considered to be acceptable. \r\rOfficers recognise that future additions to the roof, if carried out unsympathetically, could have a significant adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area, given that the southern flank elevation of the building would be exposed owing to the bungalow immediately next door. Given the significant depth of the proposed single storey rear projection, any future additions to this area of the property could also cause the dwelling to appear poorly proportioned. Accordingly, officers recommend that permitted development rights for extensions be removed by condition. \r\rSubject to this condition, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the dimensions and siting of the dwelling, as well as the degree of separation to the boundaries of the site, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. It should be noted that the proposal would pass the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest habitable room windows, which reinforces this view.\r\rIn terms of privacy, officers recognise that the proposal would offer greater views over neighbouring properties than the existing dwelling, given that it would be two storey rather than single storey. However, the typical relationship between dwellings in the area is one where residents are afforded some degree of aspect over their neighbours and officers consider the proposal to be consistent with this.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the objection received on the grounds of noise and disturbance caused during construction. However, this is not a planning consideration.\r\rTransport\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe proposal would not involve any new or amended access to the public highway and would provide one off-street car parking space, which is lower than the existing level of provision but accords with London Plan policy T6.1. This space should be provided with active provision for electric vehicle charging in order to comply with London Plan policy T6 and a condition to this effect is recommended.\r\rThe submitted plans do not show any provision for cycle parking, although it is clear that sufficient space would exist within the site to accommodate this. Accordingly, a condition is recommended requiring details of cycle parking facilities.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the objection received on the grounds of transport related disruption during the construction phase of the development. The highway safety implications of construction are material planning considerations however, there is no compelling evidence before officers to suggest that the construction works in this case would present a danger to highway users. As such, it would neither be necessary nor reasonable to control these works by condition.\r\rSubject to the recommended conditions, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the transport network.\r\rOther Matters\rOfficers acknowledge the objection received on grounds of sustainability. Officers recommend that measures to secure a reduction in CO2 emissions versus the requirements of the building regulations be secured by condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with policies D3, D6, T4, T5 and T6 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM8, DM9, DM10 and DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012. As there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
