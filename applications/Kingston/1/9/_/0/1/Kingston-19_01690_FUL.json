The\rdevelopment shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples and completed prior to occupation.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the\rdevelopment in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012",

The statement shall provide for:\r(a) Provision for loading/unloading materials.\r(b) Storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles.\r(c) Temporary site access.\r(d) Signing system for works traffic.\r(e) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other\rnuisance arising from development works.(f) Location of all ancillary site buildings.\r(g) Measures to protect any tree, shrubbery and other landscape features to be retained\ron the site during the course of development.\r(h) Means of enclosure of the site.\r(j) The parking of vehicles of the site operatives and visitors\r(k) The erection and maintenance of security hoarding.\rThe demolition and construction of the development shall be carried out in accordance with the construction method statement so agreed.\r\rReason: In order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF\rCore Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
