    "The extension and alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as it would exceed 50 cubic metres\r\rThe council considers the calculations set out with the application to be calculated incorrectly.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rPlanning permission was previously granted for Demolition of existing garage and erection of proposed ground floor side and rear extension under 19/01832/HOU on 04.02.2020. This application makes a slight alteration to the height of the roof by adding approximately 0.6 metres.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified and 5 objections have been received.\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Design fails to meet the councils own height guidelines \r- Impact on the Conservation area.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Conservation Area.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.     \r\rOfficer comment: The host property is located within Presburg Road Conservation Area. The area is described as representing the best of pre-war development which has a distinctive character and appearance of its own. The 20 houses in this area are all of the \"Queen Anne\" or \"Renaissance\" architectural style. Characteristic of this style is the fine joined red brick aprons under the windows and the rubbed brick arches to door and window openings. The high standard of design and mature gardens add to the visual amenity of the area. However, it is noted within the Designation Report that the historical interest of the area is minimal by comparison to other areas of the borough.\r\rDescribe the significance of the conservation area if necessary and conclude whether the proposal would cause any harm to the heritage asset. If less than substantial harm then do the public benefits outweigh this?\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
