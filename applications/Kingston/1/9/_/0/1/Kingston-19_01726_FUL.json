    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached, two-storey dwelling located to the southern side of Coombe Lane West, Kingston. \r\rThe site does not comprise a listed building, loccally listed building, nor is it located within a conservation area, or local area of special character.\r\rHowever, the application site is located opposite to the boundaries of the Kingston Hill / Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of the existing conservatory and erection of single-storey rear extension. The proposals also seek permission for the erection of a hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3 nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. \r\rConsultation\r8no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rNo statutory or internal consultations necessary.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33 (Single-Storey Rear Extensions), Policy Guidance 39 (Roof Dormers) and Section 4.29 relating to gable end extensions of the SPD Guidance are applicable to this application.\r\rTaking each element in turn:\r\rSingle-Storey Rear Extension\rThe SPD guidance advises that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases the following guidance will apply: \r\rDepth: \r-\tIf the neighbouring house is set at a lower level the depth of the extension should be reduced.\r-\tIf the neighbouring property has a different rear building line then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r-\tIn all cases at least 50% of the rear garden should remain. (Rear extensions to houses with very small gardens will be assessed on their individual merits.) \r-\tExtensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth.\r\rHeight: \rExtensions proposed with: \r-\ta flat roof should not exceed 3m in height; \r-\ta parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height; \r-\ta pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height; and, \r-\ta balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\r\rThe proposals involve the demolition of the existing single-storey rear conservatory-type extension which measures to 3.7m in depth, and replacement of this structure with a 5.5m deep single-storey rear extension. The proposed rear extension would span the full width of the dwellinghouse and retain an independent 1m width passageway along the side of the house to allow access to the rear garden. \r\rWhilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would conflict with the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 with regards to depth, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling. Also, the proposed extension would not be visible from the street scene, therefore the impact on the surrounding area would not be significant. As such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rRear Roof Dormer:\rPolicy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD states that dormer windows should be designed so that they: \r-\tare set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm; \r-\tare set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm; \r-\tdo not feature on the front slope of the roof (in most cases); \r-\tare designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area; match or line-up with any original windows below; and\r-\tare not built in the style of a mansard roof \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would measure 4m in width and 2m in height. The dormer would be sited so as to comply with the above guidance, set up from the eaves by approximately 0.8m and set down from the ridge by approximately 2.3m. Its positioning would align with the fenestration to the first floor on the rear elevation of the property. It is considered that the dormer would complement the host dwelling in terms of materiality and appearance and would represent a sufficiently subordinate addition at roof level. \r\rHip to Gable Roof Extension:\rAccording to section 4.29 of the Residential Design SPD, this type of hip-to-gable roof extension are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area. \r\rIn this instance, the proposed hip to gable roof extension would alter the symmetry of this pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses.  Notwithstanding, Officers note that there are a variety of roof forms evident along Coombe Lane West and there are examples, including some nearby to the application site, where one half of a semi-detached dwelling pair have altered the roof form from hip to gable end. It is therefore considered on balance that the proposed hip to gable roof extension would not appear unduly different within, or be harmful to, the character and appearance of the application property, adjoining property or wider streetscene. \r\rAlterations to Fenestration:\rThe proposals seek to add 3no. rooflights to the front roofslope. Officers note the presence of rooflights to front and side roofslopes to many properties along Coombe Lane West. The proposed 3no. rooflights are considered to be of a size and design appropriate to the host dwellinghouse and would not appear unduly uncharacteristic in the streetscene. \r\rOne window is proposed at roof level to the side (western) elevation of the dwellinghouse. This is shown to be obscure-glazed and opening to 1.7m above the floor level on the submitted plans. This is considered to be acceptable on this basis.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the host property, or the surrounding area and therefore would accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIn terms of neighbouring residential amenity, the main properties to consider are No.s 30A and 34 Coombe Lane West. The proposed rear extension would measure to a height of 2.8m with a flat roof design. This would be within the guidance parameters as set out within the Residential Design SPD. \r\rA supplementary ground floor plan has been submitted at the request of planning officers to annotate the 45-degree line from the mid-point of the nearest neighbouring habitable room windows. This clearly shows that the extension would not infringe the BRE 45-degree rule and so would not give rise to detrimental impacts in terms of sense of overbearing or loss of light to either neighbouring properties.  \r\rIn relation to No. 30A, due to the separation distance afforded by the side passageways to each property and set in from the shared boundary, Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 30A in terms of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rAlong the side elevation at roof level, 1no. window is proposed to serve an en-suite shower room. The window has been annotated on the submitted plans as obscure-glazed and no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. In the event of an approval and subject to the imposition of a pre-occupation condition to this effect, officers consider the proposals would not create any adverse impacts relating to overlooking and loss of privacy towards No. 30A.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause significant harm to the outlook, privacy and daylight/sunlight provision of the neighbouring occupiers and would therefore comply with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposal accords with the principles contained with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012 in that it would relate well to the design of the existing dwellinghouse and would have no adverse impact on the character or quality of the character of the streetscene. In terms of neighbouring amenity, it is considered not to result in any undue harm in regard to overlooking, loss of privacy, daylight or outlook provision. \r\rOfficers conclude that planning permission should be granted.",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is located on the northern side of Ullswater Crescent and comprises a two-storey, semi-detached residential dwellinghouse. \r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character, although the site is within close proximity of the Kingston University, Kingston Hill Campus.\r\rThe site is not listed or locally listed and does not fall within a Conservation Area. Neither does it have any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on the site or in the immediate vicinity. However, it does fall within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC)-a non-designated heritage asset.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of the existing garage, erection of part two storey, part single storey side and rear, basement front, side, rear extension. Erection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2no. front and 1no. side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration to fenestration.\r\rConsultation\r10no. properties were notified of the proposal. 2no. representations received, one which is in support of the proposals and one objects on the basis of impacts upon trees and privacy.\rOfficer comment: Duly noted. \r\rRBK Traffic Engineer: No comments provided.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact upon heritage assets;\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- Basement development, drainage and flood risk.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rPolicy Guidance 33 (Single-Storey Rear Extension), 34 (Two-Storey Rear Extensions), 36 (Two Storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) of the SPD Guidance is most applicable to this application.\r\rThe SPD guidance advises that two-storey side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. In practice this means that they should remain subordinate to the original house, the roof should relate well to the main roof form, existing fenestration detail should be respected and eaves levels should be reinstated.\r\rPolicy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD advises that two-storey and first floor side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. In practice this means: \r-\tthe extension should remain subordinate to the original house; \r-\tthe roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form;\r-\tflat roofs should generally be avoided unless they are consistent with the form of the existing building's roof; \r-\tcare should be taken to retain characteristic gaps between houses to prevent them from combining visually to form a 'terrace' (see Figure 38 above); \r-\tfeatures such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house in terms of their style and positioning; \r-\tthe line of the roof's eaves should run with that of the original dwelling; \r-\tbalconies will generally not be acceptable, particularly where they may give rise to overlooking; \r-\ta minimum distance of 15m shall be maintained between a primary elevation of an existing house and the flank wall of a proposed two-storey side extension; and, \r-\ta minimum distance of 21m shall be maintained between habitable room windows of neighbouring properties.\r\rOn semi-detached properties proposed side extensions should also: \r-\trespect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property; \r-\tnot exceed 50% the width of the original house; \r-\tbe set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps; \r-\tThe roof line should be set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm; and, \r-\tThe front elevation should be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house.\r\rThe proposed part single, part two storey side extension would measure approximately 3.9m in width, between approximately 10.9m and 15.1m in depth and 8m in height. It would extend along the eastern elevation of the existing dwelling and at first floor level, be set back from the front elevation by approximately 1m and set down from the roof ridge by approximately 4.20mm. The extension would be clearly visible from the street. With regards to windows and openings, two new rooflights are proposed to the front roofslope and one rooflight in the eastern side elevation at roof level (shown as obscure-glazed). \r\rPolicy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013 states that single storey rear extensions \"should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building\". In addition, they should not exceed 3.5m in depth and 3m in height with regards to flat roofs and 4m in height regarding pitched roofs. In this case, the single-storey rear element of the extension would be split, with the majority featuring a pitched roof. Both aspects would accord with Council's guidance in terms of height.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed rear dormers would be in general conformity with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (SPD), 2013 due to their subordinate and proportionate nature.\r\rThe proposed materials comprise brick and blockwork, plus painted render for the walls, red tiles for the roof, white UPVC for the windows and velux windows for the rooflights. For the mostpart the proposed materials would match existing. However, further information with regards to the patio doors, roof material for the single storey rear extension and rear door would be required to ensure that they were of an appropriate quality and finish to ensure a satisfactory appearance. This could be secured via condition.\r\rIt is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon trees as a result of the proposals.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAccording to Paragraph 206, local planning authorities should look for opportunities for new development within conservation areas and within the setting of heritage assets in order to enhance or better reveal their significance. Proposals that preserve those elements of the setting that make a positive contribution to the asset (or which better reveal its significance) should be treated favourably.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rAt the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area.\r\rFeatures of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rKingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character\rThe significance of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape. \r\rNoting that the proposed building would be of a high quality design and that the proposals as put forward in this application would not impact upon the trees on the site, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rNos. 20 and 24 Ullswater Crescent are the principal properties that must be considered with regards to residential amenity.\r\rIn terms of privacy, overlooking and visual intrusion there would be no adverse impact because there are no windows proposed in the flank walls of the extensions and the rooflight in the eastern pitch of the roof is shown to be obscure-glazed. The height and angle of the proposed rooflights in the front elevation are considered to preserve both neighbouring residential amenity and the amenity of residents of the application site and the rear dormer windows would not afford mutual overlooking into neighbouring habitable rooms.\r\rAs to sunlight/daylight, the proposal is considered not to have an unacceptable adverse impact upon either neighbouring property and the proposals would meet BRE guidelines.\r\rPolicy Guidance 31 of the SPD advises that a distance of at least 21m should be maintained between facing habitable room windows. The distances between the application site and the properties to the rear on Grassmere Avenue have been calculated to measure in excess of 38m and therefore the proposal would not allow any visual intrusion or loss of privacy, thereby satisfying the Council's design guidance in this regard.\r\rOverall and in terms of residential amenity the proposal is considered to comply with policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rBasement Development, Drainage and Flood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rParagraph 170 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should contribute to and enhance the natural and local environment by preventing new and existing development from contributing to, being put at unacceptable risk from, or being adversely affected by land instability.\r\rParagraph 178 of the NPPF 2021 goes on to say that planning decisions should ensure that a site is suitable for its proposed use, taking account of ground conditions and any risks arising from land instability. This includes risks arising from natural hazards or former activities such as mining, and any proposals for mitigation including land remediation (as well as potential impacts on the natural environment arising from that remediation).\r\rHowever, Paragraph 179 makes clear that where a site is affected by land stability issues, responsibility for securing a safe development rests with the developer and/or landowner.\r\rPolicy Guidance 43 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that when designing a subterranean development, the following guidance will apply:\r-\tAny new sleeping accommodation must have natural light and ventilation.\r-\tAny features associated with subterranean development visible from the street or surrounding properties should be discreet.\r-\tLight wells visible from surrounding properties or the street should only be included where they are a characteristic feature of the street. As such proposals to include a light well that is visible from the street will be considered on its merits.\r-\tLight wells should not exceed more than one storey underground in order to maintain adequate daylight, sunlight, and ventilation.\r-\tWhere proposed in close proximity to mature trees, every effort should be made to protect and retain trees. Where the removal of a tree is unavoidable, a replacement tree will be expected to be planted adjacent to the proposed development.\r-\tProposals for subterranean development in Flood Zones 2 and 3 (and for sites greater than 1ha in Flood Risk Zone) 1 must be accompanied by a Flood Risk Assessment.\r-\tProposals for subterranean development must be accompanied by a construction method statement (CMS).\r\rThe applicant has submitted a basement construction and methodology statement, which specifically considers the impact of the proposed basement on groundwater, to support the proposals. \r\rOfficers are satisfied that the report is authored by a suitably qualified consultant.\r\rThis basement impact assessment has shown that the proposals would have no impact on the flow of groundwater. The new basement would be designed to limit ground bearing pressure to 150kN/m2. The assessment shows that the existing geology at the depth of the proposed basement can support the new imposed loads.\r\rThe assessment includes a construction methodology and sequence. \r\rAs stated above, the NPPF sets out the criteria for when a site-specific flood risk assessment should be provided in support of a planning application and the London Plan 2021 and the Council's Core Strategy echo these requirements.\r\rThe proposal meets none of these criteria. The site is in Flood Zone 1, its area is less than 1 hectare, it is not in a critical drainage area, nor is it identified in the Borough SFRA as being at increased flood risk in future. The site is not known to be at risk from other sources of flooding (i.e. groundwater flooding) but the proposal would not, in any event, introduce a \"more vulnerable\" use to the site, since the existing use falls within this category.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a site-specific flood risk assessment or SuDS strategy as part of the proposal which, given the above, is considered appropriate. \r\rIt is recommended that a detailed SuDS design be secured by condition to ensure that the development achieves greenfield rates of surface water run-off.\r\rConclusion\rWhilst Officers acknowledge that not all aspects of the Council's design guidance would be met, overall, the proposals are considered to relate well to the original dwelling, would be subordinate in scale, would not result in any harm to the non-designated heritage asset of the site's setting within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and would not have an unacceptably adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity, thereby complying with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design Guide, 2013.\r\rThe scheme is therefore considered to be acceptable and in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.",
