    "The site comprises a  semi-detached dwelling.\r\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and two representations have been received.   1 neutral comment has been received. The neutral comment raised queries regarding access/traffic and car parking and how that may affect the residents of Hatton House to the rear of the site.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the design of the proposed development and its proximity in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Officers note that it would accord with BRE guidelines and pass the 45 Degree Rule.\r\r\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Elgar Avenue. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rRelevant History \r\r21/04043/CEU - Retention of single storey ancillary garden building.\rDecision - The applicant has demonstrated, on the balance of probabilities, that the outbuilding was completed over 4 years ago and is therefore lawful under Section 171B(1) of the 1990 Town and Country Planning Act (as amended).\r\rConsultations\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a two storey side extension, which would be sufficiently set down from the ridge of the original roof and would be set back from the front elevation. Additionally, symmetry would be maintained with the windows on existing front elevation and the line of the eaves would be maintained. Furthermore this element would be set in from the boundary at first floor level by approximately 1 metre, and would therefore not lead to a terracing effect with the neighbouring property. Officers therefore consider that this element would appear proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, whilst respecting its character. \r\rThe application also proposes a single storey side extension, which would also relate well to the original dwellinghouse, with a hipped style roof and windows to match the existing. This element would also be proportionate and subordinate to the dwellinghouse, would be sufficiently set back from the front elevation, as well as set in from the side boundary sufficiently to ensure guttering would not overhang neighbouring properties. This element would also have an acceptable impact on the character of the dwellinghouse.   \r\rIn addition, the application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension, which would measure 6 metres in depth from the rear wall of the dwellinghouse. This extension would have a pitched roof, with a parapet wall on the boundary with the adjoining property at 27 Elgar Avenue, and would measure approximately a maximum of 4.1 metres in height. Whilst the proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the recommended 3.5 metre maximum depth and maximum height for pitched roof extensions of 4 metres of single storey rear extensions as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, as the extension would be sited to the rear of the property and unviewable from Elgar Avenue, officers consider that this element would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rFurthermore the application proposes a two-storey rear extension. This extension would have a hipped roof and would measure approximately 8.2 metres in height, and approximately 5.6 metres in width, centred to the rear of the dwellinghouse. This extension would appear significantly bulky and unproportionate to the dwellinghouse, dominating the rear elevation. However, as this element is to the rear of the site and would not be viewable from the public realm, officers consider that this element would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and streetscene. \r\rFinally the application proposes the construction of a flat roof dormer extension. The extension would be appropriately set in from the sides and eaves of the roof, as well as set down sufficiently from the ridgeline. This element would not not dominate the form of the existing roof, and would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse.\r\rThis application proposes multiple extensions to the dwellinghouse. In conjunction with the existing garage and outbuilding, which would be connected to the main dwelling house as part of this application, the scale of the property would be significantly increased. However, officers consider that the proposed development, as part of this application, would largely meet the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, and would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and streetscene. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity at No. 23 and 27 Elgar Avenue. In relation to No. 23 Elgar Avenue, this neighbouring property has a number of windows at ground floor level on the side elevation facing the application site. However, these windows are either obscure glazed or if they relate to a principal room, are not the only window serving this room. As such the proposed side extension would not negatively impact the levels of light to a principal room window on the side elevation of this neighbouring property. Furthermore, whilst this neighbouring property benefits from a single storey rear extension with windows on the rear elevation, as there is an existing garage/outbuilding on the boundary at this neighbouring property, as well as a sufficient distance, the levels of light to these rear windows would not be negatively impacted by the proposed two storey and single storey rear extension. The application proposes one window facing this neighbouring property. There is no indication that this window would be obscure glazed. Officers therefore consider it appropriate to attach a condition to ensure that this window would be obscure glazed in the interests of protecting the privacy of the occupiers of the application site and the occupiers of the neighbouring property at 25 Elgar Avenue. As the two storey side extension has been set in from the boundary, officers consider that the proposed development would not have an overbearing appearance on this neighbouring property. \r\rIn relation to No. 27 Elgar Avenue. This application benefits from an existing single storey rear extension. Whilst the proposed single storey extension would extend further than this neighbouring extension, the proposed would not have an unacceptable impact on the levels of light to the windows situated on the rear elevation of this neighbouring extension. Furthermore, as the proposed two-storey rear extension is set in from the boundary, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, or loss of light. No windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property and as such the proposed development would also not lead to a loss of privacy to this neighbouring property.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a two storey semi-detached dwelling. \r\rThe site is not subject to any land use designations or environmental constraints\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of single-storey front porch and rear extensions with conversion of existing garage to habitable space. First floor side extension and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration.\r\rConsultations\r26 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed ground floor extension would accord with the Residential Design SPD in terms of depth, and would be of an acceptable scale and design finish to match the host building. The extension would match the depth of the rear extension to the neighbouring property at No.51 Kenley Road, and would be consistent with the overall pattern of single storey development within the surrounding area. Officers also note there is a variation of first floor side extensions evident in the streetscene.\r\rThe proposed first floor side extension would be setback from the front elevation, with a roof form that reflects and relates well to the main house, and would appear a subordinate and proportionate addition to the property.  \r\rThe proposed rear dormer would be set down from the main roof, it would be appropriately set in from the sides of the roof slope and in from the eaves, and as such would appear as a proportionate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rMany other garage conversions are evident in the streetscene and no objection is raised to the proposed fenestration and external treatment of this part of the front elevation, that would be finished in materials to appear in keeping with the overall design and appearance of the host building. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal properties to consider are Nos.51 and 55 Kenley Road. \r\rThere are existing extensions at ground and first floor levels to No.51 and the proposed development would mostly align with these. To No.53 the properties are not attached. At ground floor the extension would be of an acceptable scale and depth and separated from the neighbouring property ensuring no loss of privacy, outlook daylight or sunlight. There are no habitable windows to the flank elevation of No.53 that would be affected by the first floor extension and those windows proposed to the flank elevation of the first floor extension will be obscured (secured by condition). \r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rHighways and Transport\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Whilst the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street parking. The hard standing to the front of the property would accommodate 2 car parking spaces. Despite this level of provision exceeding the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, 2021, as this would reflect the existing situation, this matter would not warrant grounds for refusal.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r",
    "The site comprises a two-storey semi detached dwelling.\r\r9x consultation letters were sent to neighbouring properties and one representation has been received by the Council, highlighting the following issues:-\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- A neighbouring property benefitting from a \"right of light over 93 Shortlands pursuant to a deed of release.\"\rCase Officer response: Rights to Light issues are dealt with by Legislation which is separate from the Planning System. The remaining issues highlighted are dealt with later in this report, in so far as they are related to Planning.\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal involves the erection of a single storey infill extension to the rear of the property. Due to the built up nature of the area, the extension would not be visible from any public viewpoint, and its scale and appearance would be in keeping with the original property.  Therefore, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal would increase the footprint of the property, thereby reducing the amount of outdoor amenity space at the property. However, it is considered that there would be ample space remaining for residents to enjoy and undertake their day-to-day activities. \r\rThe eaves height to the side of the proposed extension would be 2.2 metres facing the boundary with No.91a and the added depth would be approximately 3.024 metres, to the existing ground floor extension. It is noted that there are windows to the rear/side of No. 91a within close proximity of the boundary with No.93. However, the proposed extension would be to the east and north sides of this neighbouring property and set away from this neighbouring property, which has an existing rear extension and it is considered that the proposed development would not have a significant enough impact on the amenities at 91a, to warrant refusal. The rear wall of the proposed extension, would be flush with the rear wall of the existing extension at no. 95, Shortlands Road. Therefore, the proposed extension, would cause no loss of daylight, loss of outlook, or increase in the sense of enclosure, to the rear/side of either no.91a or no. 95, Shortlands Road, to an unacceptable degree and would be in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to have an acceptable impact upon the amenities of both no.91a and no. 95, Shortlands Road. The proposal would therefore be in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).\r",
    "The site comprises a two storey semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe site is not in a conservation area or subject to any environmental constraints but is located within the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character (LASC). \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for conversion of the existing garage to a habitable room. Erection of front bay window extension and part single, part two-storey side/rear extensions. Raising roof ridge height with rear dormer roof extension and installation of 1no front and 4no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 3 objections have been received.

Existing boundary fencing and mature vegetation are also noted. The projection at first floor level is modest and set behind the rear building line of the ground floor. Given the scale of the host dwelling and surrounding properties, which are typically large two storey detached dwellings, the extension would be a proportionate addition.  The extension would have a pitched roof of an acceptable scale and external finish to which no objection is raised.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would be 4.4m in depth but would be set behind the rear building line of the neighbouring property at No.3 Branksome Way at ground floor level, and have a modest projection beyond No.3 at first floor level. The extension would incorporate a roof form and external materials that relate to the host building. The extension would not be visible to the street scene and would not appear an incongruous form of development in the context of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD by not being set down appropriately from the ridge line, however it would be set in from the sides of the roof slope and in from the eaves. Further, it is a material consideration that with some minor revisions the proposed dormer would likely fall within the parameters of permitted development. As such, the current proposal may be no more harmful than a similar development carried out under. \r\rConversions of existing garages are evident in the streetscene and no objection is raised to the proposed bay window that would have a modest projection and a similar design,  appearance and detail to the other existing bay window. \r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application property falls within the Berg Estate Local Area of Special Character (LASC) which is a non-designated heritage asset. The Berg Estate Area in this particular area is characterised by detached houses on large plots addressing the street. Officers consider that the proposed development would relate well to the host property and would not have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area or that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Berg Estate LASC.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to consider are Nos.3 Branksome Way and properties along High Drive that run along the western boundary of the site.\r\rThe proposed development would be separated in excess of 18m from the properties along High Drive that also benefit from generous rear gardens. No windows are proposed to the elevations facing these properties at either ground or first floor level.  Officers also note the existing boundary treatment would mean views to most of the development would be largely obscured. \r\rTo No.3 Branksome Way, the proposed ground floor would align with the rear building line of this property. There is a modest projection beyond the first floor building line of this property, however it has been demonstrated that outlook from habitable windows would be maintained and there would be no increased loss of privacy given the absence of windows to the flank elevations at ground or first floor level. \r\rThere are no residential amenity impact concerns in relation to the proposed rear dormer roof extension, and front bay window given their scale and siting. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of outlook, privacy or loss of light.\r\rHighways and Transport\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comments: Whilst the proposal would include the conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern internal dimensions as recommended by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of off-street parking. The hard standing to the front of the property would accommodate 2 car parking spaces. Despite this level of provision exceeding the maximum standards set out in the London Plan, 2021, as this would reflect the existing situation, this matter would not warrant grounds for refusal.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

It would cause some loss of daylight to existing ground floor rooflight windows above a kitchen and utility room and side facing windows at no.22 Aldridge Rise. It is not considered that there would be a significant loss of light such as to refuse planning permission.\rThe proposed first floor extension would project 6 metres to the rear of the neighbouring property at no.26 Aldridge Rise. However, the proposed first floor flat roofed extension is set away from the common shared boundary with no.26 and is to the north of this neighbouring property. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not significantly affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation.

To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal proerties to condiser in relation to neighbouring amenity are No. 25 and No. 29 Eastbury Road. Both properties already benefit for single storey rear extensions. The proposed extension to No. 27 would not extend beyond the neighbouring extensions.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2/3A. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets.

    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on The Mall. The site is subject to a Controlled Parking Zone, as well as the Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character.\r\rRelevant History\r\r16/16716/LDP - Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer with the installation of two rooflights on the front roofslope. Application Granted on 08 Dec 2016.\r\r02/16354/FUL - Two storey side extension incorporating garage and erection of a single storey rear extension. Application Granted on 26 Mar 2003. With conditions.\r\rConsultations\r\r69 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on heritage assets. \rThe impact of the development on highway safety and congestion. \rThe impact of the development on cycle parking.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: To the front of the property the application proposes a low level brick wall, with timber fencing on the side boundaries, which would measure a maximum of approximately 1.4 metres in height. Whilst the proposed boundary treatment would be taller than the existing, this increase in height is minimal and would not detract from the character and appearance of the area. To the front, the application also proposes the erection of a bike/bin store. Whilst these bike stores are uncommon along The Mall, due to its sensible scale and siting, as well as contemporary choice of materials, this also would be unlikely to have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rThe application also proposes the construction of a single storey extension to the rear. Whilst the proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the recommended 3.5 metre maximum depth and maximum height for flat roof extensions of 3 metres as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. Additionally this element would be situated to the rear of the site and would not be highly visible within the streetscene. As such, It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are Nos. 38 and 42 The Mall. Officers consider that the proposed developments to the front of the site would not have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of both neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTo the rear of the site, on the boundary with the adjoining property at No. 38 The Mall, there is a wall of an existing single storey extension which measures approximately 3.1 metres in height. Whilst the proposed single storey rear extension would measure approximately 3.4 metres in height, due to its reduced depth on this boundary, the proposed extension would not have an unacceptable impact by reason of an overbearing appearance or loss of light on this neighbouring property. \r\rIn regards to No. 42 The Mall, this neighbouring property benefits from a single storey side extension and a conservatory to the rear. The principal window which would be most likely to be impacted by the proposed development would be the window to the rear of the existing side extension on this neighbouring property. However officers consider that the proposed development is sited sufficiently away from this window such that it would not have a significantly detrimental impact on light to this principal room. \r\rNo windows are proposed to face either Nos. 38 and 42 The Mall and as such the proposed development would not lead to a loss of privacy to these neighbouring properties. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements. \r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficers Comments: The site is located within a Cleaveland Road/The Mall Local Area of Special Character (LASC), which is considered a non-designated heritage asset. As also stated above, Officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the host property and the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows, that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Cleaveland Road/The Mall LASC.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes a loss of hardstanding to the front of the property to accommodate landscaping and the proposed construction of the bike/bin store. Whilst the proposed would lead to a loss of hardstanding, the remaining hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least one off-street car parking space. This level of provision would be in line with the standards set out in the London Plan. \r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. \r\rOfficer Comments: The proposed cycle storage would be sufficient to facilitate the application site. Officers therefore consider that the applicant has demonstrated compliance with the cycle parking standards set out in the London Plan. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Application Site\rThe site is located to the northern side of Chestnut Grove and comprises a semi-detached, single family dwellinghouse, three-storey brick Victorian (ground to second floor) with a rather nondescript rear addition to the end of the original outrigger at ground floor only. The front of the property is treated in facing bricks with the rear of the property treated with pebble dash. \r\rThe surrounding area is residential with detached and semi-detached dwellings. \rThe application property is not statutory or locally listed, however the site does fall within The Groves Conservation Area. \r\rPlanning History\r20/00331/PRE - Pre-application advice for the erection of single-storey side/rear extension, including rebuild of existing extension and replacement side windows. Advice issued on 28 February 2020.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single-storey infill to side and rear extension, installation of side window to alleyway. \r\rConsultation\r13no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations received.\rMalden and Coombe Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No comment.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area; \r- The impact upon heritage assets; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rCouncil's Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for single-storey side extensions (under Policy Guidance 35), as follows:\r-\tThe roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof form, and the height of the roof should never encroach on the sill of windows of the second storey.\r-\tThe extension should remain proportionate and subordinate to the original house, so that in general, the width of the extension does not exceed 50% of that of the original house.\r-\tThe extension should be set in from the boundary by at least 250mm so that guttering does not overhang adjoining land.\r-\tSide extensions should normally be set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm.\r-\tCare should be taken to ensure that there is no significant loss of daylight or sunlight to neighbouring properties or gardens in accordance with the 45 and 25 degree rules described above.\r-\tFeatures such as doors and windows on the new extension should relate to those on the original house.\r-\tWhere waste bins or cycles are stored to the rear of the house, direct access to the rear garden should be maintained.\r-\tSide extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on plot.\r-\tSide extensions to semi-detached dwellings should respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property.\r\rThe proposed single-storey side extension would be visually contained behind the massing of the host dwelling and would effectively infill the gap to the side / rear most part of the dwelling to join with the rear element of the proposed extension. The side extension is shown to have a pitched roof with an eaves height of approximately 2.9m and 4no. rooflights. The extension will be set in from the neighbouring boundary to maintain the alleyway access through to the rear garden. \r\rCouncil's Supplementary Planning Document 'Residential Design' sets out guidance for single-storey rear extensions (under Policy Guidance 33), as follows:\rDepth: \r-\tIf the neighbouring house is set at a lower level, the depth of the extension should be reduced. \r-\tIf the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r-\tIn all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain. (Rear extensions to houses with very small gardens will be assessed on their individual merits.) \r-\tExtensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth.\r\rHeight:\r-\tExtensions proposed with: \r-\ta flat roof should not exceed 3m in height; \r-\ta parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height; \r-\ta pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height; and, \r-\ta balcony or roof terrace will not be considered acceptable where it causes overlooking. The exception to this may be where the building sits on a large plot with adequate screening along any shared boundaries.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would span the full width of the dwelling, with a pitched roof. The height of the pitched roof at its apex is shown to be approximately 3.9m. Two rooflights are shown to the rear extension.\r\rIt is considered that the rear infill extension as put forward on the pre-application submission would represent a sufficiently subordinate addition in terms of its depth, which would in effect 'square off' and project to the same depth as the existing rear projection (which is to be demolished). The overall scale and massing of the infill rear extension is considered to be acceptable.\r\rThe proposals include fenestration openings to the side elevation to serve the rear/side extension, together with the addition of a door and window to the original building along the side elevation. All of the proposed windows are shown to be obscure-glazed and, as such, are considered to be acceptable. \r\rThe proposed materiality is shown to be London Stock brickwork to the side elevation, with side and rear window framing and the rear elevation (which is mainly glazed) in a powder coated aluminium finish to limit the material palette. As per Officer advice given in the pre-application enquiry, the roof is proposed as slate with lead flashings. \r\rThe proposals would also involve the removal of the pebble-dash finish to the rear elevation and to treat and expose the facing brickwork. This is considered to represent an improvement to the appearance of the rear façade of the dwelling, which is considered acceptable in character and appearance terms. \r\rOverall, it is not considered the proposed development would detract from the character and appearance of the host property, or the surrounding area and, therefore, would accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets \rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposed extension would change the appearance of the rear of the building, however, it is considered that the proposed extension would not constitute a harmful addition to detrimentally affect the character of the host building and it is considered that the extension would not result in harm to the setting of the Conservation Area. \r\rThe Malden and Coombe Conservation Area Advisory Committee has not responded to this application. However, officers note that the rear / side infill extension of the proposal would not be visible from public vantage points along Chestnut Grove given that it would be single-storey and sit behind the massing of the host building. The proposed materiality and design is considered to be complementary to the host dwelling.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed rear extension would increase the footprint of the property and thereby reduce the amount of private amenity space available for residents to enjoy. However, adequate amenity space would be retained so that the enjoyment of the property is not compromised.\r\rThe extension is shown to be set in from the neighbouring western boundary in order to maintain the alleyway access to the garden, and would also be set in slightly from the original building. The proposed rear extension is considered not to have a materially harmful impact upon the ingress of daylight / sunlight to the living accommodation of No. 53.  \r\rThe alleyway setback will ensure there is no harm to the adjacent property; the eaves will be just under 3m but set back over 0.8m from the boundary fence.\r\rThe proposed depth of the rear extension would be as the existing rear extension (i.e. a maximum of 3m from the original elevation of the dwelling), with no side-facing windows proposed to the eastern side elevation. This scale and design of the proposed extension is not considered to be materially different than the existing and does not give rise to concerns regarding its impact upon the adjacent property to the east (No. 49) in terms of loss of outlook, light or privacy. \r\rTwo windows are proposed to the western side elevation of the proposed extension which are shown to be obscured-glazing. In addition, a further window and door is proposed to the western side elevation, the window similarly annotated on plans as obscure-glazed. As such, these are not considered to represent harm to through loss of privacy or opportunity for materially harmful overlooking towards No. 53 and are considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and would not result in harm to the designated heritage asset of The Groves Conservation Area. The proposals are not considered to result in materially harmful loss of light or create opportunity for overlooking and similarly the proposed extensions are not considered to be overbearing in terms of its scale and design.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be compliant with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",

We cannot accept plans labelled As Built. \r\rYou will already have all the Existing plans from the original applications for the extensions, so please submit those, and you will need to relabel the \"As Built\" plans as \"Proposed\". \r\rIt is noted that there is also a related application for the site reference 23/00838/HOU (for Relocation of Side Entrance) awaiting validation and we consider it easier for you to submit all the proposals under one application under this new reference number to include this new proposal.
