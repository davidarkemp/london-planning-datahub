    "The site comprises Austin House and an associated car parking area. It is situated on a prominent corner plot and fronts Surbiton Hill Road to the east, St Mark's Hill to the south and south-west, Church Hill Road to the west and Avenue Elmers to the north-west.\r\rThe site is not in a conservation area or the setting of a conservation area. There are a number of locally listed buildings in the vicinity of the site.\r\rThe site is within Flood Zone 1 (low risk).\r\rThe site is located within Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) 'S' and has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 5 (very good).\r\rPlanning History\rAny relevant planning history for the site has been taken into account in considering this application and recent planning history is available to view on the Council's website.\r\rAssessment\r\rSection 96A gives Councils the power to make non-material changes to planning permission. The legislation states:\r\r(1) A local planning authority may make a change to any planning permission (granted following an application to the authority), relating to land in their area if they are satisfied that the change is not material.\r(2) In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission.\r(3) The power conferred by subsection (1) includes power to make a change to a planning permission,\r(a) to impose new conditions\r(b) to remove or alter existing conditions\r(4) The power conferred by subsection (1) may be exercised only on an application made by or on behalf of a person with an interest in the land to which the planning permission relates.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non-material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it.\r\rAlthough what defines a non-material amendment is to the discretion of the local authority concerned and lacking in legal definition, the following key tests could be applied in assessing the acceptability of a change to an approved scheme under the non-material amendment procedure: \r- Is the proposed change material/significant in terms of its scale (magnitude, degree etc) in relation to the original approval? \r- Would the proposed change result in a development that will appear noticeably different to what Official interested parties may have envisaged? \r- Are the changes of consequence? \r- Could the change result in an impact on the amenity of occupiers of adjoining properties? \r- Would the interests of any third party or body who participated in or where informed of the original decision be disadvantaged in any way? \r- Would the amendments be contrary to any planning policy of the Council?\r\rOfficers Comment: \rThe proposal description for prior approval application 21/01576/PACND was as follows:\r\r\"Construction of two additional storeys of new dwellinghouses above Austin House, St Marks Hill, Surbiton, KT6 4LT to provide 12no.x new dwellings (2no. x1 bed 1person units, 8no. x1 bed 2 person units and 2no. x 2 bed 4 person units), with works for the construction of appropriate and safe access to and egress from the new dwellinghouses and works for the construction of storage facilities reasonably necessary to support the new dwellinghouses\".\r\rThe applicant contends that an error was made in the proposal description with the unit mix being as followed, as shown on the plans submitted and approved through 21/01576/PACND.\r\r- 4no. x 1 bed 1 person units; \r- 4no. x 1 bed 2 person units; \r- 2no. x 2 bed 3 person units; and \r- 2no. x 2 bed 4 person units. \r\rThe size of residential units is relevant to the assessment of a prior approval application insofar as Paragraph (9A) of the 'Interpretation' of The Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) which requires an assessment against the Nationally Described Space Standards. \r\rWhilst the proposal description stated the incorrect unit mix and the officer report also made various references to the incorrect unit mix, it is accepted that the drawings submitted were correct and that an assessment by the Local Planning Authority and Appeal Inspector of the Gross Internal Area of the units would have been made on this basis. It can also be clarified that the units do indeed meet the required GIA based on the corrected unit mix. \r\rWhilst the proposal description that was subject to consultation was incorrect, as referred to above, given the application drawings (floor plans) themselves showed the correct unit size mix and were also made available to view on the Council's website, it is not considered that the interests of any third parties was prejudiced. \r\rThe amendment subject to this application does not change the development approved through 21/01576/PACND and is not considered to have prejudiced the interests of any third parties. \r\rAs such, the Council considers the amendment to the proposal description to be non-material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment is approved.\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rProposal \r\rSection 73 application to vary plans condition 2 of planning permission 19/00125/FUL to allow for an enlarged basement \r\rConsultation\r\rOne neighbour objection received. Objection summarised as follows\r\r- size of basement\r\rOfficer comment: That objection is addressed in the officers assessment\r\rKCAAC: Objection. We objected strongly to the original planning applications\r(19/00125/FUL & 15/1268/FUL) for this new-build which, in our view, will\rcause harm to the character & appearance of the N Riverside\rconservation area. By extension, we also object to this latest application,\rwhich would double the size of the storage area in the consented\rbasement.\r\rOfficer comment: Authorisation for officers to make a delegated decision has been given by the chair of the kingston Town sub planning committee. The objection is addressed in the officers assessment. \r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates soley to the approved basement under planning permission 19/00125/FUL. There are no visible changes to the approved scheme externally proposed and the mix and number of units would not change. \r\rThe enlargement to the approved basement proposed is considered to be minor and would result in an overall basement area proporpionate to the existing built form and the purposes it would serve, storage for a family sized unit.\r\rThere would be no visual impact to the approved scheme and there would be no change to the context of the approved scheme within in its surroundings and the proposal would have a neutral impact on the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding designated heritage asset of the Riverside North Conservation Area. \r\rThe proposal would not impact upon the residential amenities of the neighbouring occupiers, trees or exacerbate existing or future groundwater flow, land stability or flood risk in the area. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "CONSULTATIONS: \r1.\tNo objections have been received. \r\r2.\tHistoric England did not consider it necessary for them to be notified.\r\rSITE AND SURROUNDINGS: \r3.\tThe application site is located on the southern side of Anglesea Road and comprises of a late 19th Century Grade-II listed building. It is understood that the house was originally built as a stables and coach house for Arundale on Portsmouth Road. However, in the 1920s, internal alterations were made for its use as a single family dwellinghouse. \r\r4.\tThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and the site is within close proximity to the River Thames.\r\r5.\tThe site does not fall within a Conservation Area and does not fall within a Flood Risk Zone or have any Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on the site or in the immediate vicinity.\r\rPROPOSAL: \r6. Listed Building Consent is sought for the replacement of the roof on a like for like basis. \r\rASSESSMENT: \rPrinciple of Development:\r7.\tThe principle of replacing the roof to a residential dwelling within a residential area is acceptable subject to compliance with Development Plan policies and the Planning (listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended).\r\rCharacter and Appearance and Heritage Impacts:\r8. Paragraph 197 of the NPPF states that in determining applications, local planning authorities should take account of: \ra) the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation;\rb) the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and \rc) the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\r9. Paragraph 199 of the NPPF states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\r10. Section 16, Section 66 and Section 72 of the Planning Listed Building and Conservation Areas Act 1990 directs that special attention shall be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of Listed Buildings, their settings and Conservation Areas. This direction is carried through into the Council's Core Strategy. \r\r11. Policy DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy seeks to preserve or enhance existing heritage assets, and allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or setting. \r\r12. The application property is Grade II listed (date of listing: 06/10/1983). The Listing description of the building states the following: \"Later C19. 2 storey house. 4 bays wide. Brown brick, laid in English bond, with stone window dressings. The windows are mostly paired, with chamfered mullions and jambs and shouldered arches. Casement windows. The doorway has a tiled, gabled porch. Patterned tiled roof, gabled over the left-hand bay.\"\r\r13. In determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 197 of the NPPF 2021 requires local planning authorities to take account of the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation, the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality, and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\r14. When considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, Paragraph 199 states that great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\r15. Paragraph 201 says that where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of) the significance of a designated heritage asset, permission should be refused unless it can be demonstrated that the harm or loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh the harm or loss, or all of the following apply:\r\r- The nature of the heritage asset prevents all reasonable uses of the site;\r- No viable use of the heritage asset itself can be found in the medium term through appropriate marketing that will enable its conservation;\r- Conservation by grant-funding or some form of not for profit, charitable or public ownership is demonstrably not possible; and\r- The harm or loss is outweighed by the benefit of bringing the site back into use.\r\r16. Paragraph 202 goes on to say that where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\r17. The application proposal relates solely to the replacement of the roof to the property. The roof has been subjected to long-term frost damage in the roof tiles, which had spalled and delaminated, as a result of freeze-thaw action. The existing roof covering, felt, batten and tiles are beyond repair. This application proposes to replace the entire roof with \"like-for-like\" materials. \r\r18. The proposed works comprise of the complete replacement of the existing roof with like for like materials. The external appearance of the roof will be the same, except for the use of new materials.\rThe felt, batten, breather felt, tiles, ridge tiles, valley tiles and lead flashing will all be new materials.\r\r19. The proposals would involve stripping the roof to bare rafters. \"5u felt\" bituminous membrane will be laid, as well as \"Tyvek\" breather membrane felt. Handmade dark texture tiles are proposed, including valley and ridge tiles and, also, club tiles for an ornamental patterning / finish as existing. The materials will weather over time to blend in with the overall character and appearance of the main property. \r\rCONCLUSION\r20. The proposed style and appearance of the replacement roof is considered to be of a high-quality and to preserve the special character and appearance of the Listed Building, whilst improving thermal performance of the property. The proposals are considered to comply with Paragraph 199 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a large, detached dwelling located in spacious grounds, located within the Kingston Hill/Commbe Hill Strategic Areaof Special Character (SASC) and The Drive Local Area of Special Character (LASC) - non-designated heritage assets. None of the buildings on the site are listed or locally Listed. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension and part first floor rear extension; side dormer roof extension and rear gable roof extensions and infill garage roof extension to first floor side extension and relocation of the front entrance.\r\rDemolition of existing conservatory and erection of part single, two storey rear extension. Alterations to roof including rear gable and side dormer roof extensions with installation of 4no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Garage infill roof extension with installation of 2no rooflights. Associated changes to fenestration\r\rConsultation\r5x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals. One objection has been received, which raises the following summarised concerns:\r- Effects on trees\r- Privacy - This revised application continues to relate to the new roof level dormer window which directly overlooks our property. Currently there is only one small window overlooking us at a lower level, hidden behind bushes. The privacy of our garden will be significantly compromised by the new dormer window and we are concerned that (a) the size of the casement means that the proposed relatively modest dormer window can be increased at a later date and (b) there would be continuous disputes over the trimming of the boundary trees in front of this window as our neighbour's try to maximise light and we try to safeguard privacy. We are pleased that the council is taking appropriate measures to safeguard TPO'd and other significant trees which are a key feature of the road's character.\r\rCase Officer comment:- No trees will be removed in the rear garden as part of this proposal. Overlooking privacy issues will be discussed later in this report.\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer- No objection to the proposals in relation to trees and landscape providing that adherence to the submitted and approved Arb method Statement & Tree protection plan is conditioned within any permission.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and its impact on character and appearance;\r- The impact on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- The impact on trees.\r\rDesign, Character and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe Architect for the previously refused scheme (21/00704/HOU) has confirmed:-\r- The outdoor swimming pool included with the previous scheme has been removed from the proposal.\r- The front entrance door of the house will be retained as the existing.\r-  No trees will be removed in the rear garden.\r- The shape of the ground floor rear extension has been modified but the depth of the extension will be the same as the previous proposal.\r\rLarge detached dwellings in spacious grounds are a common feature of this part of The Drive. It would be possible to catch glimpses of the proposed development from The Drive and Gatehouse Close. However, Officers consider that the proposed development would relate well to the existing dwelling and would not appear unduly prominent or incongruous within The Drive or Gatehouse Close street scenes. The proposal is therefore in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rAs noted above, officers consider that the proposed development would be acceptable in character and appearance terms. Therefore, it follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the non-designated heritage assets in this case. The proposal is therefore in accordance with the NPPF 2021, policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: A condition is recommended to obscure glaze and fix shut the proposed side facing dormer window, which would face towards No.3, to safeguard privacy levels for this neighbour. The introduction of any additional side facing windows above ground level, could also significantly impact the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and a condition is recommended to prevent this. In relation to rear facing windows, it is considered, as a result of existing rear facing windows at first floor to habitable rooms, the loss of privacy caused by the proposed rear facing windows at second floor level, would not be significant enough to warrant refusal.\r\rThe current proposal includes a balcony at first floor level, to the rear/side of the property. The closest common side boundary is 8.2 metres from the balcony. The boundary treatment which consists of vegetation, would not adequately screen this neighbouring property and could, in any case, potentially be removed at a later date. A side privacy screen on the southern side of the proposed balcony will be conditioned as a safeguard to minimise loss of privacy to Fleur House to the south.\r\rIt would be possible to attach an informative, to limit noise and disturbance generated during construction. The design and siting of the proposed development would not otherwise cause any significant loss of amenities to neighbouring properties, in terms of outlook, sunlight/daylight, or visual intrusion.\r\rTrees and Landscape\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer Comment: The RBK Tree and Landscape Officer has no objection to the proposals in relation to trees and landscape providing a condition is included with an approval, for adherence to the submitted and approved arboricutlural method statement & tree protection plan is conditioned within any permission, in accordance with Policy G7 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance set out in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD 2013.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
