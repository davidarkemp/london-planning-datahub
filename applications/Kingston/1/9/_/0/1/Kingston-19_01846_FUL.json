Please therefore, update the Tree plan by naming and numbering each tree eg; T.1 Beech. -Fell and grind stump completely. etc;  exactly as I have done above if you agree with my naming/numbering, or, send a new Tree Plan Sketch with updated information using the example provided, regarding all the trees cited in the amended proposal.  Further, you have made mention of the following: 'Elda and lilac in cluster are poor specimens and the Horse Chestnut will lift the drive and possibly interfere with the foundations of the garage and adjacent drainage. Pittosporum will be replanted here'. \rPlease confirm if you are proposing any works for the 'Elda & Lilac trees' mentioned above and if so, what works you would like to be carried out.

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".",

This is not acceptable in light of the TPO.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse & grant lesser works as follows:\r\rT.9 Ash - Repollard to previous points only.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe applicant has submitted adequate justification for the removal of T.3 Oak, but the application includes the removal of T.4 Yew the roots of which tree have not been found in bore hole samples and as such the evidence submitted is insufficient to justify the removal of this second tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse & grant lesser works as follows:\r\rT.3 Oak - Fell.\r"
