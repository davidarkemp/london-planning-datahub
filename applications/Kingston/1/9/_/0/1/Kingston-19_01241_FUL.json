    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown.\r\rAssessment:\rRepeat works mior in nature to maintain large trees in small garden setting. Trees to rear of property not affecting public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 18/06/2020\r\rAssessment:\rThe roots of T.2 have caused the low boundary wall fronting onto Palace Rd to buckle and crack and the only way to make the wall safe is to remove the tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 18/06/2020.\r\rAssessment:\rT.1 Is damaged at approximately 1.5m where the trunk has impacted upon the adjacent brick garden wall and the tree has grated away a chunk of the trunk at this point through rubbing on the wall and has attempted to heal with reactive growth unsuccesfully.  T.2 & T.3 are healthy young trees and can tolerate the works to reduce them so that they do not intefere with the overhead cables.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",

Neither G.1 or G.2 works adeversely affect public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 18/06/2020\r\rAssessment:\rThe works to reduce T.2 & T.3 are appropriate and acceptable to maintin the trees in close proximity to multiple dwellings. The removal of T.1 whilst not desirable is understandable given the poor union at a low height meaning that the twin stems of the tree are inherently weaker and more susceptible to failure through wind loading. T.1 is not visible to the public and therefore it's removal is not presenting any particular loss to public amenity. This means it fails the main test of suitability for a TPO.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",
