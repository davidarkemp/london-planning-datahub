    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development shall be carried out in accordance with the material specified on the approved plans and application form unless otherwise agreed by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with policy DM10 Design Requirements for New Developments (including house extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Detailed drawings at the scale of 1:20 of the fenestration and fascia detailing shall be submitted to and be approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the relevant part of work is begun. The  detail  thereby  approved  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  that approval. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with policies DM12 and DM10 Design Requirements for New Developments (including house extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "As the application property is a self-contained flat it does not benefit from permitted development rights and therefore if you wish to make an application you will need to submit a full planning application",
    "From the application description you state the proposal is for a mixed use development (A1/D1) however your supporting statement advise that the proposed use is Sui Generis.\r\rKindly clarify and amend accordingly.",
    "Please provide existing (Pre-Existing) roof plan at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL).\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or Â£2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \r\rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the CIL calculations.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or CIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email cil@kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rNo supporting information has been submitted demonstrating that the tree in question is involved in causing subsidance.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate works to reduce, make safe and maintain a very large tree in close proximity to a public right of way in the interests of health and safety and of good tree management.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
