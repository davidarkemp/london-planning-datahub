    "---Officer Report---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008",
    "Application Site\rThe site is located on the southern side of Coombe Lane West and comprises the New Victoria Hospital. The surrounding area is mainly residential in character. Malden Golf Course is located to the south of the site and is designated as Metropolitan Open Land (MOL) and a Site of Nature Conservation Importance (SINC).\r\rThere are tree preservation orders on the site, and on neighbouring sites.\r\rThe site is also located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC). The Coombe Hill Conservation Area lies to the north of the site, on the opposite side of Coombe Lane.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a first floor extension for office accommodation, support spaces/amenities, staff restroom, toilets, meeting/breakout spaces and cellular offices.\r\rPlanning History\r12/14177/FUL- Proposed refurbishment and part single, part two-storey side extension to the New Victoria Hospital including alterations to the existing vehicular access points onto Coombe Lane West and reconfiguration of existing car parking area. Granted planning permission, dated 17 October 2012.\r\r21/01932/FUL - Erection of first floor extension (office accommodation, support spaces/amenities, staff restroom, toilets, meeting/breakout spaces and cellular offices). Refused planning permission, dated 9 August 2021. Permission was refused for the following reasons:\r\r(1)\tThe proposed first floor modular extension, by virtue of its design, form and materials, would detract from the appearance of the host building and cause harm to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.  The proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 203 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).\r\r(2)\tThe proposed first floor extension would require a damaging level of reduction to TPO trees. The proposal has failed to provide appropriate detail robustly demonstrating absence of harm via an Arboricultural Method Statement Assessment. As such the application is contrary to Policy G7 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).\r\r(3)\tThe site of the proposed extension lies adjacent to Metropolitan Open Land and a Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC). The proposal has failed to provide appropriate assessment of the ecological baselines and potential impact and therefore conflicts with London Plan 2021 Policy G6 (Biodiversity and access to nature) and Policies CS3 (The Natural and Green Environment) and DM6 (Biodiversity) and of the of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012).\r\r21/03660/PRE - (Meeting and Advice) A first-floor extension of New Victoria Hospital, to increase office accommodation. Support spaces/amenities will also be required and will include a staff restroom, toilets, meeting/breakout spaces as well as some cellular offices.  Written advice issued on 10 March 2022.\r\rConsultation\r23no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health - No objection, subject to a condition restricting the hours of construction.\r\rRBK Highways and Transportation - No response received.\r\rRBK Trees and Landscape Officer - No objection, subject to a compliance condition with the submitted AIA being attached to any permission.\r\rRBK Biodiversity Officer - Notes the exceptional circumstances of this case. Requests that a pre-commencement condition is attached to ensure that bat surveys have to be undertaken during bat activity season and any necessary mitigation measures resulting from the surveys have to be implemented prior to any work on site. The applicant has agreed to the implementation of this pre-commencement condition.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area (including impact upon heritage assets);\r- The impact upon trees; \r- Biodiversity implications; and\r- Highways\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rParagraph 126 of the NPPF states that \"The creation of high quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps make development acceptable to communities.\" It goes on to say in paragraph 130 that planning decisions should ensure that new developments\r\"a) will function well and add to the overall quality of the area, not just for the short term but over the lifetime of the development;\rb) are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping;\rc) are sympathetic to local character and history, including the surrounding built environment and landscape setting, while not preventing or discouraging appropriate innovation or change.\"\r\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF (2021) states that \"The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\"\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy states that \"the Council will protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development\". \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires development proposals to incorporate principles of good design. Policy DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy states that the Council will preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design.\r\rPolicy DM5 states that the Council will only allow development on sites adjacent to MOL that do not have a detrimental impact on its visual amenities.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rThe site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, which is a non-designated heritage asset. The site lies opposite the designated heritage asset of Coombe Hill Conservation Area, with the boundary being to the northern edge of Coombe Lane West. \r\rThe special architectural and historic interest of the conservation area can be summarised as: \"the estate and hinterland to the demolished Coombe Warren, containing several mid-19th century properties by architect George Devey and other large interesting 20th century houses in a spacious landscaped setting, adjoining Coombe Hill Golf Course\".\r\rThe significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character can be summarised as an area of exceptionally high quality landscape with important views both within and beyond the Borough.\r\rThe previously refused application proposed a modular system of eight interlocking modules as the proposed first floor extension. Externally, the existing plastisol coated finish of the units would be overclad with metal panels in a grey colour tone. Officers were not satisfied that the proposed extension would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area or that the proposals would not result in any harm to its significance.\r\rThe aspects of the existing building which are of merit are generally considered to be the red clay tiles and red brick. \rThe proposed 35m long x 9m wide first floor extension will be formed with rendered cavity walls and a tiled part pitched part flat roof to match the existing dormer on the western side of the hospital. The windows are shown to be aligned with those existing at ground floor level. A new staircase is proposed on the courtyard to connect the new office accommodation with the rest of the hospital. \r\rOfficers consider that the proposals satisfactorily address the concerns raised with respect to the previous scheme's design and also implements the advice given at pre-application stage, resulting in a more cohesive appearance between the proposed extension and the host building.\r\rThe proposed extension would be sited is to the eastern boundary adjacent to the car park area. \r\rA Heritage Impact Assessment has been submitted as part of the planning application to justify the proposed design and materiality of the extension in the context of the designated and non-designated heritage assets. \r\rWhen viewed from the Golf Course to the south, the proposed extension will present a small projecting gable over the roof of the east Alexandra Wing which matches the mono-pitched roof form and white render finish of the existing south gable over the theatre suite, also seen from the golf course, Figure's 4 and 5. The gable will be set back from the boundary with the Golf course by the depth of the south Alexandra Wing and further screened by a row of mature trees on the Golf Course boundary.\r\rThe pitched roofing materials proposed, Rosemary Light Mixed Brindle clay tiles would correspond with the existing roofing materials used in recent extensions to the Hospital and will improve the aspect of the current flat roof seen from the adjoining Car Park and Care Home to the east, Coombe Hill Manor. Officers concur with the assessment contained within the supporting heritage statement that this aspect is less significant as the proposed extension is limited in its wider visibility outside of the grounds of the Hospital with restricted glimpse appreciation of the proposed extension from the adjacent Conservation Area. \r\rOverall, the proposals are considered to result in less than substantial harm to the non-designated heritage asset of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Area of Special Character and to the designated heritage asset of the adjacent Coombe Hill Conservation Area.\r\rImpact upon Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rIn the previously refused application, Officers considered that the proposals would lead to a harmful reduction / impact upon the protected trees along the southern boundary of the site and in the absence of an Arboricultural Method Statement or any additional detailed assessment of the trees nearest to the application proposals, the application was recommended for refusal on the basis of harm to protected trees. \r\rThis application is supported by an Arboricultural Impact Assessment including a Tree Protection Plan. Council's tree and landscape officer has reviewed the submitted documentation and accepts the findings of the reports and does not raise any objection, subject to a condition requiring compliance with the submitted technical information.\r\rImpact upon Biodiversity\rLondon Plan Policy G6 requires that development proposals should manage impacts on biodiversity and aim to secure net biodiversity gain. This should be informed by the best available ecological information and addressed from the start of the development process.\r\rWhilst the site is not itself subject to any statutory or non-statutory designation, Metropolitan Open Land and the 'Malden Golf Course and Thames Water Pipe Track' Site of Borough Grade 1 Importance for Nature Conservation (Malden Golf Course) lies immediately adjacent to the southern site boundary. \r\rThe recently refused application cited a further reason for refusal based on insufficient information regarding ecological impacts of the proposals, including the ecological zone of influence of the application to the Site of Importance for Nature Conservation (SINC) site and surrounding area.\r\rCouncil's biodiversity officer has reviewed the submitted preliminary ecological appraisal and confirms that the report appears to be conducted in line with the relevant guidance including Cieem's Guidelines for Preliminary Ecological Appraisal (2017). Officers welcome the mitigation hierarchy referenced in the report, which is outlined in the NPPF and endorse all of the recommendations (R1-R9) which are secured via condition. Officers note the exceptional circumstances of this application and, as such, in this particular instance deem it acceptable to deal with bat surveys by way of a pre-commencement condition to ensure that bat surveys are undertaken during bat activity season (May - August) and any necessary mitigation measures resulting from the surveys have to be implemented prior to any work on site.\r\rHighways & Transportation\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 1b (very poor) and is not particularly well served by public transport. However, it is considered that the proposed additional administrative floorspace would not result in any material impact on the highway or highway safety conditions.\r\rConclusion\rIt is considered that the proposal would not detract from the appearance of the host building and would harm the character and appearance of the area, including the non-designated heritage asset of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and the adjacent designated heritage asset of Coombe Hill Conservation Area, in accordance with Policy HC1 of the London Plan, 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rThe proposal has provided an appropriate assessment of the biodiversity implications within the Metropolitan Open Land and Malden Golf Course and Thames Water Pipe Track SINC and has also provided supporting arboricultural information for officers to find that the proposals are acceptable, in accordance with Policies G6 and G7 of the London Plan, 2021 and Policies, CS3, DM6 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rRecommendation:\rThat the application be GRANTED.\r",
    "reason for refusal has not been addressed.\r\rConclusion\rIt is considered that the proposals go beyond the scope of a Section 73 minor-material amendment planning application as the prior approval which the applicant is seeking to vary concerned a change of use and additional storeys and not operational development to the rest of the existing building. The proposals would go beyond the prior approval consent and the description of development. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.",

    "The site comprises a commercial unit located on the ground floor within Kingston Town Centre. The site is not within a conservation area. \r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposed alterations appear appropriate for a commercial premises and given the immediate local context, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFlood Risk\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed shopfront would not increase the amount of impermeable surface existing on site, and as such, the proposed development would have no impact on the vulnerability of the site or neighbouring sites with regards to flooding.\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an upper floor maisonette located on Lancaster Gardens. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of  side and rear dormer roof extension with rear Juliet balcony and installation of 2 nos front and 2 nos rear rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Removal of rear chimney stack.\r\rConsultations\r20 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rFour representations have been received, one in support and three objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Car park issues\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Overdevelopment\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- Loss of privacy/overlooking\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Noise\r\rThese concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposed roof extensions are not set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm, contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. Furthermore, the proposed roof form of the side dormer would introduce a new form that is uncharacteristic to the surrounding area and the existing maisonettes. The  collection of roof forms would appear incongruous and would  disrupt the symmetry of the roof of the adjoining property, resulting in an unacceptable impact on the existing street scene. \r\rOfficers note the relatively open character of the surrounding area and characteristic separation distances between maisonettes that contribute positively to the appearance of the area. The proposed development due to very close proximity to the boundary would reduce the separation distance between properties resulting in an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the existing street scene and the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed scale, mass and bulk of the proposed rear dormer is considered to be acceptable in isolation. \r\rIt is noted that the property does not benefit from Permitted Development Rights. \r\rOverall, it is considered that the collection of roof forms would  not be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding maisonettes and would disturb the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property resulting in a jarring and incongruous appearance which would have an unacceptable impact on the street scene. Furthermore, due to its siting and scale, the proposed side dormer would reduce characteristic separation gaps between the properties resulting in an unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the area. Given the above the proposed side dormer roof extension is considered to be contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the siting of the proposal it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight or sunlight in relation to the neighbouring properties. The proposed Juliet balcony would not result in increased overlooking of the neighbouring gardens that would be significantly different to the existing situation. \r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rWith regards to the impact of the development on the existing car parking facilities, Officers note no parking restrictions on Lancaster Gardens. The proposal does not include any changes to parking and additional one bedroom may not necessarily result in significant impact on the existing car parking facilities on Lancaster Gardens. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, which is considered sufficient. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling. The site is located in the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Conservation area a designated heritage asset.\r\rConsultation \r\rNo responses received. \rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. Paragraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and the proposal would preserve the overall character and appearance of the host property.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\r\rThe proposal would result in the loss of a garage. However it is considered that sufficient off-street parking would remain at the site and the propsal would not lead to an increase on street parking demand or prejudice highway safety. The loss of the garage does result in the loss of a place for secure cycle parking and a cycle parking condition is recommended to secure on site cycle parkig that is covered and secure in line with securing sustainable transport objectives and reducing the need to travel by car.\r\rThe application is adjacent to protected trees but does not propose to remove any of said trees. The application is supported by an arboricultural report and it is recommended that the development is carried out in accordance with the report and its mitigation protection measures and this be secured by condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

Subject to the satisfaction of these conditions it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion, on street car parking pressure, or compromise pedestrian or highway safety. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers consider that the proposals would not be significantly different from the existing situation and would therefore have no adverse impact upon highways and transportation, thereby complying with Core Strategy Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\r15 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed hip-to-gable roof extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given that it would unbalance the roof profiles of the terraced properties, however officers note that there are a number of similar extensions in the immediate vicinity and as such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the host dwelling or surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would not strictly adhere to the separation distances as set out in the Residential Design SPD, the proposed development would have a modest depth and height, and would maintain the eaves of the host property. As such, it is considered that the proposal would appear a subordinate addition to the host property. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would retain an element of separation from the neighbouring properties, and given that the first floor rear extension would pass the 45-degree plan test in relation to the closest habitable windows, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
