    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rLondon Borough of Richmond - No objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed rear extension would measure 4m in depth which is over the parameters of the Residential Design SPD (4m v 3 - 3.5m depth), however given the modest height, would appear a proportionate addition to the host dwelling. Therefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application site comprises an end terraced building located on the northern side of Kings Road. It is in mixed use with a vacant commercial unit at ground floor and residential above. The site is located within the Kings Road Local Centre and a 'Key Views' corridor. \r\rOne objection has been received with respect of the single storey rear extension on the grounds that increasing the footprint of the site would result in a more intensive use; the rear extension would have an adverse impact on outlook; the proposal may be a precursor to a second storey extension; deliveries would now be taken from the rear; concerns in relation to use of the rear of the site as consulting rooms; and additional parking stress on Staunton Road.  \r\rOfficer comment: The planning history confirms that a certificate of lawful development has been granted for the use of the ground floor for any use falling within Use Class E which permits the co-location of a number of uses. The application does not concern a change of use and is limited to operational development only. The proposed plans do indicate that the rear extension would enable the rear part of the commercial unit to be used as consulting rooms. Therefore, although the application does not concern a change of use it is clear that the applicant proposes to use the ground floor for at least two uses comprising a cafe and consulting rooms, both of which fall within uses Class E. It is recognised that the use of the application site could change to a number of uses falling within Class E without requiring planning permission, and it is not evident based on the information submitted with this application, that the proposed extension would lead to over intensive use of the site. Matters such as traffic/trip generation or parking requirements are not relevant to this application as it does not propose a change of use. Furthermore, in regards to the extension being a precursor to further extensions, all applications must be considered solely on their own merits. In regards to deliveries, the provision of the extension would not prevent deliveries being taken from the front if that was previously the case. As the proposal does not concern a change of use of the site, Officers are concerned that a condition pertaining to the deliveries would not meet the tests of the NPPF (2019). Comments in relation to impact on outlook are addressed below.\r\rThe application as submitted included the provision of an extraction flue, however, following an objection from environmental health on the grounds of lack of information pertaining to noise and odour, the flue has been removed from the application. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development, namely, the new shop front and rear extension is appropriate for a commercial premises. In regards to the immediate local context, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposal would not result in any adverse impacts for neighbouring occupiers as listed above. However, Officers are cognisant that permission exists for a the use of the upper floors for residential purposes and the use the roof on the rear extension as a roof terrace could have a detrimental impact on the amenities of residential occupiers so a condition is proposed to control this. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r19 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the single storey side extension does not strictly accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, it would be set back from the front elevation, with a modest roof height and would be finished in materials in keeping with the host property. As such, the proposed development would appear as a subordinate addition to the original dwelling and would not appear out of keeping with the surrounding area.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed side extension and flank wall of No. 11 Lingfield Avenue, and that no side facing windows are proposed, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No. 11 Lingfield Avenue by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Further as the proposed side extension would not extend past the existing rear elevation of No. 17 Lingfield Avenue they would not be adversely affected by the proposed development by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.  \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
