The proposed development would therefore not accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed private amenity space would not provide amenity space of a suitable and useable standard and would therefore not accord with Section 3.5 of the London Plan for Quality Housing, Policy               Guidance13 (Private Amenity Space) of the Residential Design SPD and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed window at second floor level upon the flank wall would result in a harmful sense of overlooking to the wider street scene and surrounding properties thereby negatively affecting the amenity of neighbours. The proposed development therefore does not comply with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development does not accommodate parking and cycling demands on site. The proposed development therefore does not comply with CS7 and DM8 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy and The London Plan (2016).",

    "Section 59 of the Highways Act permits the Highway Authority to charge developers for damage caused by excessive weight and movements of vehicles to and from a site. The Highway Authority will pass on the cost of any excess repairs compared to normal maintenance costs to the applicant/organisation responsible for the damage.",
    "The developer is reminded that it is an offence to allow materials to be carried from the site and deposited on or damage the highway from uncleaned wheels or badly loaded vehicles. The Highway Authority will seek, wherever possible, to recover any expenses incurred in clearing, cleaning or repairing highway surfaces and prosecute persistent offenders. (Highways Act 1980 Sections 131, 148, 149).",
