    "The facing materials to be used in the construction of the elevation shall be those specified on the application form and approved drawings or such other materials as have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before the development is commenced and shall thereafter be retained as such.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the details shown on the approved plans, prior to the commencement of any works to the elevation of the building, architectural detailed drawings at a Scale of 1:5/1:10 showing the architectural details of the windows serving the accomodation hereby approved (details of the sash), the relationship between the window frames and the elevations (details of the window reveals), and deatils of the proposed materials (timber), shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The windows hereby approved shall be installed prior to the beneficial occupation of the flat hereby approved and thereafter permanently retained.\r\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and in order that the special architectural and historic interest of this listed building is safeguarded in accordance with Policy CS8 (Character, Heritage and Design) and Policy DM 12 (Development in Conservation Areas and Affecting Heritage Assets) of the LDF Core Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "Prior to occupation details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development hereby approved shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  These facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall thereafter be retained for use at all times.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of satisfactory cycle storage facilities and in the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM8 (Sustainable Transport for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Within 3 months of first occupation, evidence must be submitted to the council confirming that the development hereby approved has achieved not less than the CO2 reductions (ENE1) associated with meeting London Plan emissions requirements and internal water usage (WAT1) standards equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes level 4 targets. Evidence requirements are detailed in the \"Schedule of evidence Required for Post Construction Stage from ENE1 & WAT1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes Technical Guide. Evidence must demonstrate a minimum 35% emissions reduction compared to 2013 part L regulations, and internal water usage rates of 105l/p/day must be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing.\r\rReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation in accordance with Policies 5.2 (Minimising Carbon Dioxide Emissions) and 5.3 (Sustainable Design & Construction) of the London Plan (July 2011) and Policy DM1 (Sustainable Design and Construction Standards) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's\rBuilding Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts. A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.",

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party\rWalls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".",

Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.\r\rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation. Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank\rAssumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing. A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.\r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.",
