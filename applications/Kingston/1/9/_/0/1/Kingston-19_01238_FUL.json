    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed hip-to-gable roof extensions would not necessarily adhere to recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, officers note that the proposed extension could be constructed under permitted development. Further, while the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the side roof slope, it would be set in from the eaves and ridge of the roof slope and would appear a proportionate addition to the original dwelling, given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rWhile an opening is proposed to the side elevation at second floor level, given that it is proposed to be obscure glazed officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r22 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on flood risk and drainage.\r\rRecent planning permission 21/00059/HOU is also material to the assessment of these proposals.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly adhere to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, it would have an appropriate height and as such would not appear out of proportion to the dwelling house. It is is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed front porch extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed two storey side extension would not be set in from the shared boundary, it would have an appropriate roof that would be set down substantially from the ridge and set back from the front elevation at first floor level. As such officers consider that on balance it would be acceptable. In addition, officers note that similar extensions can be found in the immediate vicinity and therefore the proposals in this case would not appear out of keeping with the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale and siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, and that no windows are proposed to the side elevation, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposal would include the demolition of the existing garage, officers note that the width of the existing garage would not conform to modern day internal dimensions as set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such officers consider that there would be change to the provision of on-site parking. \r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, particularly due to the loss of the side access to the rear of the property, officers consider that further details could be ensured via condition to ensure compliance.\r\rTherefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk assessment states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application site is located on the south side of Jubilee a short distance to the west of the junction of Kingston Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is mixed in use. The site is not in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed. The site is located in the Metrpolitan Open Land.\r\rNo objections have been received.\r\rThe application seeks to determine whether the prior approval of the Local Planning Authority is required for the siting and appearance of the installation of 20 metre high monopole supporting 6 no. antennas and 2 no. transmission dishes, 4 no. equipment cabinets and associated development works\r\rThe application has been assessed against the provisions of Schedule 2 Part 16 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 as amended. The application has also been assessed against the policies of the National Planning Policy Framework and the current Development Plan policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rThe National Planning Policy Framework 2021 is clear at paragraph 118 in as much as the Local Planning Authority should not question need. Local planning authorities must determine applications on planning grounds only. They should not seek to prevent competition between different operators, question the need for an electronic communications system, or set health safeguards different from the International Commission guidelines for public exposure.\r\rThis application is for prior approval, not for planning permission. Prior approval is a light-touch process which applies where the principle of the development has already been established (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 028 Reference ID: 13-028-20140306).\r\rPrior approval means that a developer has to seek approval from the local planning authority that specified elements of the development are acceptable before work can proceed. The matters for prior approval vary depending on the type of development and these are set out in full in the relevant parts in Schedule 2 to the General Permitted Development Order. A local planning authority cannot consider any other matters when determining a prior approval application (National Planning Practice Guidance) (Paragraph: 026 Reference ID: 13-026-20140306).\r\rThe main considerations of the case are: \r\r- Siting and; \r- Appearance\r\rThe application is located in the designated Metropolitan Open Land which for the purposes of making an assessment in terms of land use is given the same status and assessed as Green Belt land.\r\rSection 336 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended) defines a building as any erection or structure. As such the proposed development, and associated equipment, would fall to be classed as a building(s).\r\rThe NPPF directs that the erection of a building in the Green Belt would be inappropriate development save for a number of limited exceptions., these are listed in paras 149 and 150. The development proposed is not listed in either paragraph and as such is therefore inappropriate development in the Green Belt.\r\rInappropriate development in the Green Belt is by definition harmful and should not be approved unless there are considerations which would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and any other harm so as to amount to very circumstances.\r\rOther than need, although no information has been put forward to robustly discount other locations, the applicant has not put forward any other considerations which, taken individually or cumulatively would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt and any other harm so as to amount to very special circumstances.\r\rIn addition to the definitional harm to the Green Belt, it is proposed to locate the mast on a prominent roadside junction. The proposed mast would be 20m in height which would be in excess of 10 to 12m higher than a standard telegraph pole (8m) and street lamp column (10m) which are typical of other such predominant perpendicular pieces of street furniture found in the locality and it is considered due to its appearance in particular its height it would be an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views of the site and detract from the character and appearance of the area.\r\rIt is considered that the siting and appearance would not be appropriate for this location as it would both constitute inappropriate development in the Metropolitan Open Land and create an incongruous addition that would be visually intrusive in the surrounding views of the site and detract from the character and appearance of the area. It is recommended that the application be refused as it would not accord with paragraphs 147 - 151 of the National Planning Policy Framework and policies CS8, DM5 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rThe need for an upgraded, modern telecommunications network is both acknowledged and appreciated, and indeed is given great weight in the decision making process; however, for the reasons cited above it is considered that the harm caused by the proposed installation would outweigh the benefits.\r\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The site is occupied by a two storey semi detached dwelling and single garage to the side.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations have been received. One in support of the proposal and one with concerns regarding a loss of light.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Flood risk.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would accord with the height parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, and would replace an existing single storey pitched roof structure to the rear, with a full width rendered, pitched roof extension. The proposed extension would also be lower in height than the existing structure located on the boundary with No.106 Cheshire Gardens, and would maintain the same building line as it relates to this property.  \r\rAlthough the extension would project beyond the neighbouring property at No.102 Cheshire Gardens, officers acknowledge that the projection is modest, and given the considered scale and external finish of the proposed extension it is unlikely to result in any harm to the overall character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would maintain the same depth as it relates to No.106 Cheshire Gardens and be lower in height than the existing building on the shared boundary. The extension would project beyond No.102 Cheshire Gardens, however officers acknowledge it is a modest projection and the extension would accord with the parameters of the SPD in relation to height. The plans also demonstrate compliance with the 45 degree daylight and sunlighting criteria of the SPD.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 2. The applicant has submitted a site-specific flood risk assessment which sets out that floor levels within the extensions would be set no lower than existing and flood proofing of the development has been incorporated where appropriate in order to mitigate the risk of flooding to occupiers of the development. Officers note the flood zone relates to the very rear of the application property. Given the modest scale of the development and the above it is considered the development would not exacerbate the current risk posed to the existing built environment.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections from one household have been received relating to the effect on trees. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the proposed development on protected trees on site; and,\r- The impact of the proposed development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rTree and Landscape Officer - No objection subject to conditions\r\rProposal \rOfficers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 21/01529/HOU. The principal issue with the refused application was that the proposal did not provide adequate information to ensure that there would be no adverse impact to protected trees on site. The applicant has provided the relevant supporting information in elation to this matter and it will be further considered in this assessment. Officers acknowledge that the scheme subject of this application and in comparion to the previously refused scheme proposes no design amendements. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the two storey side extension would not strictly accord with the parameters of the Residential Design SPD, the development would be set back from the front elevation and would retain the catslide roof feature. The proposed part single, part two storey rear extension would be inkeeping with the original dwelling in terms of roof forms, bulk, scale and mass. Overall, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would have a depth that exceeds the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, however, given the context of the site, it would not appear a disproportionate addition to the host property or out of keeping with the character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed part two storey rear extension would have a roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling, and would be set in appropriately from the shared boundaries. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the original building or the immediate surrounding area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the proximity of the development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light/sunlight. While openings are proposed to the side elevation at first floor level, officers consider that a condition can be imposed if the development were to be approved to mitigate any loss of privacy for neighbouring properties.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers are satisfied that the submitted Arboricultural Method Statement and Tree Protection Plan provided in support of the application would ensure that the proposed development would not adversely affect the health or longevity of protected trees on site.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the hardstanding to the side of the dwellinghouse would be reduced as a result of the proposed development, officers note that there is sufficient hardstanding to the front of the dwelling to retain at least 2 car parking spaces. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum car parking satndards set out in the London Plan, Officer consider that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. As the side access to the rear of the dwelling would be significantly narrowed, officers consider that there would be insufficient space to access the rear garden and secure cycle storage options therein. As such officers consider that a condition requesting cycle parking details be attached to any grant of planning permission to ensure compliance.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building.\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a single storey rear extension. \r\rConsultation \r12 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r \rCharacter and Appearance \rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed extension would accord with the height parameters for flat roof rear extensions set out in the SPD, and although it would project further than 3.5m from the existing rear building line, it would align with the neighbouring property (which forms a pair with the application property) at No.11 Neville Road. \r\rThe extension would project beyond the rear building line of No.15 Neville Road, however, the buildings are physically separated  and the extension would be in keeping with other rear building lines/extensions evident along this part of Neville Road. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area would be acceptable.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed extension would match the depth of the neighbouring property at No.11 Neville Road. To No.15 Neville Road, the extension would maintain the existing setback (set back from the boundary) and is of an acceptable height (in accordance with SPD requirements) with no windows proposed to the side elevation.  \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. One representation has been received objecting to the proposal. No other details were provided other than stating an objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rRear Extension\r\rThe proposed single storey ground floor side extension would not accord with the parameters of the SPD projecting 9m from the rear wall of the existing building in an 'L' shape design along the boundary shared with No.14 Durbin Road and 1.2m with the opposite boundary shared with No.18 Durbin Road. \r\rOfficers acknowledge the existing outbuildings on site and those on the neighbouring property at No.14 Durbin Road however these structures are not connected to the host buildings, and the proposed extension would have a larger footprint/building envelope than currently exists, and would set an unwanted precedent for a pattern of development that is not characteristic of the surrounding area. There is also no other evidence or justification to warrant approval for an extension of this nature.  \r\rThe combined depth and siting of the proposed extension are not therefore considered to represent a development that respects the existing pattern of development, and the built form of neighbouring properties.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe siting and the depth of the proposed extension in relation to No.14 Durbin Road is unsatisfactory however any sense of enclosure or loss of outlook may be largely mitigated by the existing outbuildings located on this property.  There are windows proposed to the side elevation of the proposed extension however these could be obscured by condition to ensure no loss of privacy to the occupants of No.18 Durbin Road. \r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal would not to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole.
