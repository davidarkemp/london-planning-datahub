    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. While this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development has nevertheless already been established. \r\rOn such an application, the local planning authority may only consider the conditions subject to which permission should be granted. It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rIn assessing the application, officers are mindful of any changes in planning policy or site circumstances since the granting of the original permission.\r\rThis application proposes to vary Condition 1 (Plans condition) of planning permission 21/00719/HOU dated 12.05.2021 by amending the following:\r-to provide 1no. x rooflight to rear elevation; and,\r-to provide 1 no.x window to front elevation. \r\rOfficers note that there was no legal agreement attached to the original permission.\r\rConsultation\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;  and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 objections have been raised relating to:\r\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Noise\r- Privacy \r\rRelevant Planning History\r99/07293/FUL - Erection of part two storey part first floor side extension, incorporating garage, single storey rear extension, and rear dormer roof extension in association with loft conversion. This application was Granted on 16 Dec 1999. With conditions.\r\r21/00535/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 4m and eaves height of 3m). This Prior Approval  was Refused on 01 Apr 2021. Due to confliction with with Paragraphs A.1 (g) (ii), (j) (i), (j) (iii), and (ja) of Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\r21/01409/PAEXT - Erection of single storey rear extension (6m in depth, maximum height of 4m and eaves height of 3m). Prior Approval was found Not Required on 10 June 2021. \r\r21/01969/HOU- Erection of single storey rear conservatory extension and retention of existing kitchen extension. Granted with condition on 16.09.2021. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension together with the existing single storey rear extension (99/07293/FUL) would have a total depth of 6m. Although the proposal would not strictly comply with the council's Residential Design SPD, the proposal  is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rGiven the scale and siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, as well as it's design, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Your Existing Elevation plans imply that the window stickers that are in your application form are already in place. There are no \"Proposed\" Elevation plans. Please can you confirm if you are applying for the window stickers, illuminated projecting sign, and fascia sign retrospectively - i.e. because they are already there?",
    "The scale bar on the Shop Plan is inaccurate - it does not measure to the stated 5metres length. Please correct the scale bar and resubmit the plan. Please note, we will use the Site Location Plan as produced by UK Planning Maps, instead of the Site Location Plan that is on the same document as the Shop Plan.",

Please amend the Site Location Plan red line boundary as follows:\rclose the gap in the red line boundary along Hogsmill Lane to create a solid boundary line\rdo not draw a red line around the whole building itself - the red line should continue from the road to the building and there should be no red line dividing the site into different parcels.\r"
