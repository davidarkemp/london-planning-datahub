    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL).  \rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or Â£2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk <mailto:mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk> or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",

If it is non-illuminated then you will need to amend the plans. If it is  illuminated then the description of works would have to be amended. (please confirm).\r\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAcceptable minor repeat works with no adverse impact upon tree health or public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
