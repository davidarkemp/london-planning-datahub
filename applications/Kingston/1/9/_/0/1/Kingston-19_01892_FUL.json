It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling. The site does not fall within a conservation area but does adjoin the Claremont Road Conservation area.\r\rProposal\rErection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 4no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion\r\rConsultation\rEighty neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been raised with regards to considerate parking in the neighbouring car park. This is not a material consideration but an informative can be included should permission be granted reminding the applicant of the importance of considerate parking.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee -  Objection unless revised - the design is not of a high enough standard to be acceptable within the CA and therefore in its present form, the proposals would result in harm to the CA. The\rlarger rear dormer should be reduced in size and the upper part should sit below the ridgeline. As designed at present, large dormers such as the one proposed appear excessively large sit poorly within the roofscape and are therefore not appropriate in the CA. Any roof lights should be kept to a minimum and employ flush/conservation grade profiles.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on the adjoining Conservation Area.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them. As noted above, the site although not in the Conservation area, does adjoin it. Officers would therefore be required to assess the development as it would effect the land and buildings within it.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear dormer is not in compliance with Policy 39 of residential design guide SPD as it has not been set down from the ridge of the existing roof. It is therefore not considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. The proposed hip to gable roof extension would not complement the character of the original or neighbouring dwellings. It would appear contrived and discordant in appearance from the street and to the original property by way of its overall design.  It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rOfficers consider that the proposal would amount to less than substantial harm to the conservation area and it is therefore necessary to weigh this against any public benefits of the proposal. The applicant has not advanced any arguments as to the public benefits of the proposal, nor is it apparent to Officers that there would be any. The proposed development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and there would be no public benefits to outweigh the identified harm, thereby conflicting with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is not considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a two-storey, semi-detached dwelling located on the south side of Somerset Close, which is a well-established residential area. The property is set in from the side boundary with no. 41 Somerset Close by a driveway that leads to a parking space at the rear of the property. The rear garden of the property has a depth of approximately 18m, beyond which are the rear gardens of properties in Knightwood Crescent. The property is not listed, nor is it within a conservation area, and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity. The site is located within flood zone 1 as defined by the Environment Agency. \r\rThe planning history relevant to this application is:\r20/02117/HOU - Erection of part single, part two storey side extension. Erection of single storey rear extension. Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Erection of rear detached outbuilding and conversion of existing garage to store room - refused November 2020\r\r19 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and four objections were received following the consultation period. The issues raised in the responses are:\rAccess or traffic problems\rCar park issues\rExcessive height or bulk of buildings\rInappropriate design/layout\rUnacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rThe design of the proposed development;\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\rThe impact upon highway safety.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed side extension will be set-in from the side boundary with no. 41 Somerset Close, and so maintain an appearance of separation from the neighbour. Its height and size are in keeping with the original property and it will have the appearance of a traditional domestic extension. Within the rear roofslope, the proposed dormer would be set in from the ridge and eaves, as well as the sides so that it appears as a subordinate feature within the rear elevation. The single storey rear extension will be of an appropriate size and scale in relation to the property and will also have the appearance of a typical domestic extension. The outbuilding is also of an appropriate scale and appearance. Cumulatively, it is considered that the proposed additions would not unduly dominate the original property and so there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe outbuilding would be located at the rear of the property in close proximity to boundaries with adjoining properties in Somerset Close as well as Knightwood Crescent. Given the size of the outbuilding as well as the size of the neighbouring gardens, it is not considered that the structure would unduly dominate these garden areas to the detriment of the occupants. It is recommended that permitted development rights are removed to prevent windows being installed within the side and rear elevations to prevent any overlooking of these gardens. The side extension would be located within close proximity to a similar addition at no. 41 Somerset Close and there are no windows within the side elevation of that neighbour that would be adversely affected by the proposal. The rear extension would be adjacent to the boundary with no. 35 Somerset Close, but is height and depth are such that an acceptable relationship with this neighbour would be maintained.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\rDespite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate an off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a residential property on the south side of Moor Lane, which is a classified road that is maintained by the Council. There are examples of dropped kerbs at neighbouring properties that provide off-street parking space within the property curtilage. There are no street trees or grass verges that would be affected by the proposal.\r\rThe proposed parking space will have dimensions of 5.1m x 5.8m, which is of adequate space, and will be positioned at a right angle to the highway. It is considered that this would be an acceptable size and accessible from the highway. The proposed development would therefore accord with policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012 and the RBK Crossover Policy 2020.\r",
