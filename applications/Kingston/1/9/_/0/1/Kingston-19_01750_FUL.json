One letter has been received regarding the following summarised concerns:\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- issue over land according to deeds.\r\rThe issue relating to the deeds is not a planning consideration and would require a party wall agreement.\r\rOfficer response:\r1. The application has been assessed using BRE guidance in relation to loss of daylight/sunlight.\rCondition A.4. (7) of (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 states that where an owner or occupier of any adjoining premises objects to the proposed development, the prior approval of the local planning authority is required as to the impact of the proposed development on the amenity of any adjoining premises.\r\r2. The proposed extension would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight and would pass the 45o test with regards to daylight as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD in relation to  Nos 114 and 118 Rollesby Road.  It is not considered that the proposed development would have any significant or unacceptable adverse impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties.",
