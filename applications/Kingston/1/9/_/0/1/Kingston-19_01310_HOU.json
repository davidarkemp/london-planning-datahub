    "The proposed development, by virtue of the total loss of the front boundary treatment would result in a harmful impact on the appearance and quality of the dwellinghouse and wider Local Area of Special Character. Therefore, the proposed development would fail to comply with the policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of its size does not comply with the crossover policy requirements. What is more, the proposed crossover would result in the loss of two parking spaces on the resident's parking bay which is not acceptable. Therefore, the proposed development does not comply with CS7 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Kingston & Sutton Vehicle Crossover Policy (April 2012).",
