This can be achieved with either mechanical extract or openings. Please provide details.\r Please confirm background ventilation will be provided at a rate of 8,000mm2 to habitable rooms, and 4,000mm2 to bathrooms in accordance with ADS F table 1.7 (copy attached). Please note night latches are no longer considered acceptable for background ventilation.\r Intermittent mechanical extract should be provided to the following locations and should discharge at the following rates: Bathroom - 15l/s; WC - 6l/s. All extracts should discharge to external air (NB: recirculating fans are not classed as extract); for windowless accommodation intermittent extracts should have a 15-minute overrun.\r Please confirm all extract fans will be located a maximum 400mm below ceiling level.\r Extract fans should not exceed the following noise levels; Fans located in bedrooms or living rooms 30dB, fans within kitchens and bathrooms 45dB.\r \rPART H - Drainage and Waste Disposal\r Please provide details of all new, or alterations to existing above ground drainage installations.\r \rPART J - Combustion Appliances and Fuel Storage Systems\r Please clarify the proposed heating to the works and if any flues are proposed as their location is subject to control.\r \rPart K - Protection from Falling, Collision and Impact\r Any glazing in critical locations should be constructed of safety glass.\r The height, construction and design of guarding and balustrades is controlled and consideration should be given to their design.\r Staircases are controlled including the rise and going, handrail design, balustrade, headroom, pitch and tapered tread layout.
