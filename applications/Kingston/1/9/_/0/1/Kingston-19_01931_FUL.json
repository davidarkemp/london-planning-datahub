    "The proposed extensions and alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B.2, (b) (aa) & (bb) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). \r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate how the eaves of the original roof are maintained or reinstated, or that the edge of the enlargement closest to the eaves of the original roof are, so far as practicable, not less than 0.2 metres from the eaves, measured along the roof slope from the outside edge of the eaves.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The existing dwelling is in poor condition and has an unsympathetic, two storey side extension topped by a flat roof. The proposed development would significantly improve the appearance of the dwelling through incorporating the existing extensions and additional infill extensions under (with the exception of the single storey rear extension) an entirely pitched roof. The proposal is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The objections received on grounds of loss of light are noted and it is acknowledged that the single storey rear extension would be greater in height than is recommended by the Council's Residential Design SPD. However, 22 Ullswater Crescent benefits from a single storey rear extension of similar dimensions. The other neighbouring property, 26 Ullswater Crescent, has a pitched roof extension which projects approximately 1m beyond the rear building line of the application property, meaning the resultant difference in depth would be approximately 3m. This is considered to be relatively modest and officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any materially harmful loss of light or appear overbearing. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant planning policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.",
    "The key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the proposals on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposed development upon highways and transportation.\r\rPolicies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 require that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. Architecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rOfficer Comment: The site is located directly opposite the Coombe House Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: The core of the demolished 16th century Coombe House manorial estate, including walls, outbuildings, and landscape features from the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries, together with 20th century infill developments. The proposed dwelling would be of a contemporary design but would be of a suitably high quality and would not dominate or otherwise compete with the surrounding historic features or landscape. It is therefore considered that there would be no harm to the setting of the conservation area and it would preserve its character and appearance.\r\rPolicy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 requires that buildings and structures do not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of surrounding land and buildings, particularly residential buildings, in relation to privacy, overshadowing, wind and microclimate.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 requires proposals to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is recognised that the proposal would provide large balconies which would wrap around the rear and western sides of the dwelling at first floor level. Although the resultant concerns regarding privacy are noted, Officers are mindful of the fact that they would be in excess of 21m from the neighbouring property to the north and, given this and the dense vegetation along the boundaries of the property, officers consider that the balconies would not give rise to any materially harmful loss of privacy. Nevertheless, it is recommended that the balconies be screened along their western edges to prevent views into the grounds of the neighbouring Coombe Hill School. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy 3.5 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 act together to ensure that new development reflects the standards in the Government's Nationally Described Space Standard 2015. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires that each new dwelling has a minimum of 50m2 of private garden (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would greatly exceed the above requirements.\r\rParagraph 109 of the NPPF states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. Policy 6.3 of the London Plan 2016 requires that the impacts of proposed development on transport capacity and the transport network are fully assessed. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The existing access to the site would be preserved and its use would not intensify as a result of the proposals. It is therefore considered that the proposal would not have an adverse impact on highway safety.\r\rPolicy 6.13 of the London Plan 2016 states that the Mayor of London wishes to see an appropriate balance being struck between promoting new development and preventing excessive car parking provision that can undermine cycling, walking and public transport use. To this end, Table 6.2 of the Parking Addendum to the London Plan 2016 sets out maximum car parking standards which should be the basis for considering planning applications.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. Policy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposal would provide space for a greater number of cars to be parked off-street (approximately 5) than the London Plan maximum standard. However, this level of provision would be equivalent to the existing provision on the site, similar to others in the surrounding area, and reflective of the low accessibility of the site. As a result, Officers consider that it would be unreasonable to object on this basis.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
