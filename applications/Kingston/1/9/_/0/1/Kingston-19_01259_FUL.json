    "The proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity by reason of the insertion of windows in the rear elevation at first floor level and the introduction of a balcony to the front elevation at second floor level which would give rise to unacceptable levels of overlooking/loss of privacy regarding properties Nos. 20, 22 and 24 The Mall and the properties at first and second floor level in the eastern corner of Surbiton Court, thereby conflicting with Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development has failed to incorporate a mix of unit sizes to meet the identified housing needs of the Borough. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that the delivery of 30% of the units as family units would be unsuitable or unviable. As such, the development is contrary to Policy DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate satisfactory measures to ensure that the three parking spaces proposed in the north-western part of the site could be safely accessed without resulting in vehicular/pedestrian conflict. In the absence of these measures, the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact on highway safety thereby conflicting with policies CS7 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to ensure that future occupants of the proposed development would be precluded from obtaining on-street car parking permits, the proposed development would lead to inconsiderate parking and increase on-street car parking pressure in surrounding thereby conflicting with policies CS7 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The applicant has failed to provide a sufficient number of cycle parking spaces for the proposed development and failed to encourage sustainable modes of transport thereby conflicting with Policy 6.9 of the London Plan 2016 and Policy DM8 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
