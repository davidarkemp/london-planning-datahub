    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on the northern side of Nelson Road. The site is not subject to any particular policy designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal\rDemolition of existing garage and erection of two storey side and single storey rear extension\r\rConsultation\r10 Neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposal and one objection has been received raising the following summarised concern:\r- Inappropriate design/layout.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and;\r- The imapct of the development on highways and transportation.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to the single storey rear extension element of the proposal Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies:\rIf the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\rIn all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain.\rExtensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth.\rExtensions with a flat roof should not exceed 3m in height.\rExtensions with a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height.\rExtensions with a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height.\rIn this case whilst the proposed depth of the single storey element would exceed 3.5m, it is acknowledged that both neighbouring properties have benefitted from ground floor extensions and outbuildings and have a different rear building line. Therefore, a single storey rear extension with a depth of approximately 4m would be acceptable.\r\rWith regards to the proposed two storey side extension, Policy Guidance 36 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 states that the extension should remain subordinate to the original house, be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps, The roof line should be set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm; and, The front elevation should be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house. Care should be taken to retain characteristic gaps between houses to prevent them from combining visually to form a 'terrace'.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the existing two storey side extension at neighbouring property, No. 50 Nelson Road has already caused the loss of symmetry to the pair of semi detached dwellings the application forms part of. However, this extension would fail to appear as a subservient addition. The proposed extension would also fail to comply with Policy Guidance 36 in terms of an insufficient set down from the main roof ridge, set back from the front elevation and lack of set in from the shared boundary. The proposed development is therefore considered to be of an excessive scale and due to its insufficent set down from the main roof ridge, set back from the front elevation and set in from the shared boundary would be unacceptable in terms of form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would create an incongruous addition to the host property that would detract from its character and appearance and that of the surrounding area and be visually intrusive in the streetscene. The proposal would not accord with D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The principal properties to consider are Nos. 50 and 54 Nelson Road. The proposed single storey rear element of the proposal is considered not to have an unacceptable adverse impact on No. 50 Nelson Road due to its proportionate height and limited projection beyond the neighbouring single storey rear extension.  In relation to No. 54 Nelson Road the extension would not project beyond that at the neighbouring property. In terms of the two-storey side extension, whilst it would result in some loss of light to the windows on the eastern flank wall of No. 54, this loss would be acceptable as the windows are not principal habitable room windows.  There would be no loss of privacy or outlook  given the absence of windows in the proposed flank wall. Therefore, overall, the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways and transportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers note the proposals would result in the loss of the existing garage on site. However, the garage would not conform with the minimum space requirements set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013 and would be too small to accommodate modern vehicles. Therefore, this loss would not constitute a loss in the number of off-street car parking spaces on site. Officers also note that the remaining hardstanding to the front of the property would be large enough to accommodate 1 car parking space which would conform with the maximum stamdards set out in the London Plan, 2021.\r\rIn terms of cycle parking, due to the loss of the existing garage and storage options therein, the side access to the rear of the property and an omission of secure cycle parking storage details on the submitted plans, compliance with the requirements of the London PLan has not been demonstrated. Notwithstanding and in the event of an approval it is considered that there would be adequate space to the front of the property to store bicycles and these details could be secured via condition.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Please provide a copy of block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "Please provide existing and proposed floor plans at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire floor plan, not just part and all key dimensions for the proposed works.\r\rThe scale bars in the submitted floor plans do not measure to the stated scale.",
