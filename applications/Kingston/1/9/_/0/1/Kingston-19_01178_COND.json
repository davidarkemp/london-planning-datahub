    "Assessment\r\rCondition 6 of planning permission 18/10212 states\r\r\"Detailed elevations and sections for the proposed fire doors to the Southern Elevation at ground floor level shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority before any above ground works are commenced on site. The development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved plans\".\r\rThe reason for imposing this condition was: to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\rThe frame of the proposed fire doors would measure 2390mm high and 2168mm wide. Stainless steel panic bars are proposed across each leaf of the fire doors.\r\rThe proposed fire doors would be located at ground floor level to the South facing elevation. There would be 3 sets of fire doors along this elevation. \r\rThe design and appearance of the proposed fire doors are considered to be in-keeping with the appearance of the  approved office building. The proposed panic bars across the doors would add some visual clutter to the doors. However, given their size and location at ground floor level it is considered that they would not be easily visible from the street scene or the surrounding area \r\rIn light of the above, the proposed material is considered to be acceptable and it is recommended that this condition is discharged.  \r",
    "Please be advised there is a discrepancy on your covering letter that states both a 3 storey and a 2 storey extension to the application site. Kindly clarify accordingly."
