    "1.\tCONSULTATIONS:\rNeighbour notification: A site notice was erected in the vicinity and advertised in the local press published on 07.10.2019. No representations received.\r\rHistoric England: No view expressed on the proposal.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No comment/neutral - \"as the window is being replaced by new timber windows, we have no comment\".\r\r2.\tSITE AND SURROUNDINGS \rThe application site comprises of a Grade-II listed mansion house located on the western side of Ashcombe Avenue, Surbiton. The site is roughly rectangular in configuration, bounded on the east side by Ashcombe Avenue and all remaining sides by neighbouring properties and their respective gardens. The site includes three buildings on the site, Southborough House, which is the principal building, a double garage and a summer house. These buildings are set within landscaped gardens with mature trees which screen the neighbouring buildings. \r\rThe application site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area. Southborough House and the Summer House are both early 19th century (1808) buildings designed by John Nash and are both designated Grade II Listed.\r\rThe Historic England Listing description is set out below:\r\r\"1808. By John Nash. Main front to garden. 2 storeys. Stucco. Slate roof. 2 chimneys. Deep wood cornice with brackets widely spaced. 7 windows wide (1st floor semi-circular, sash, with bars radiating) square headed windows to ground floor. 4½¨ reveals. Centre pediment with circular oculus. Bay window ground floor centre, with door; upper glazed with bars. Interior contains original marble chimney pieces, panelled doors with reeded surrounds also other contemporary fittings.\"\r\rList Entry Number: 1080088.\r\r3.\tPROPOSAL \rThe proposals seek the removal of the existing Crittal window at first floor level on the south-western elevation and enlargement of the window to form two timber windows. \r\r\r4.\tASSESSMENT \rImpact upon Listed Building\rSection 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states that 'In considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.'\r\rNPPF provisions:\rIt is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework sets out that the local planning authority should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset... They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset's conservation and any aspect of the proposal.\r\rChapter 16 sets out the framework for decision making in planning applications relating to heritage assets and this application takes into account the relevant considerations in these paragraphs.\r\rThe subject window is located on the first floor overlooking the copper clad dome over the front entrance porch to the south-eastern elevation of the listed building. The position of the window is such that it is largely not visible from the exterior. The subject steel-framed window is a 20th Century addition to the property which is designed by John Nash. \r\rThe application property is subject to a previous consent (under planning reference: 18/16186/LBC) was granted to remove this same window and replace with two timber sash windows, one of which was to emulate the original semi-circular headed windows found elsewhere on the property and noted within Historic England's Listing Description. This permission has been unable to be implemented as on-site investigations have shown that the lintel over the existing Crittal window is supporting the roof structure in such a way that removal would be highly invasive. \r\rAs such, the lintel is to be retained. It is acknowledged that the provision of a semi-circular headed window is impossible without compromising the greater elevation and roof. \r\rThe application proposals put forward, here, seek to install a fixed lite painted timber window. Externally, the window will be square-headed and match the new sash window, adjacent, which was approved under planning reference 18/16186/LBC. To the interior, the details will replicate the existing profiles and be painted to match the original windows. \r\rIn terms of its value, the existing steel-framed window is assessed as having a detrimental value to the overall significance of the property; being a later 20th Century addition which is out of keeping with the original windows in terms of both materiality and format. The proposed materials and proportions would be a more sympathetic match to the historic fabric of the building elsewhere. Therefore, the proposed change to this single window is considered to represent an enhancement to the heritage asset. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade II Listed Building, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the heritage asset as per the requirements of the NPPF (2019). \r",
