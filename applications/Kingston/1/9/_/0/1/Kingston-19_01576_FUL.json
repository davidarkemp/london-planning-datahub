    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rTrees to the rear of the property and not having much impact on public amenity being not very visible from the street. The works to the Acacia which is clearly in decline having been topped in the past, are acceptable to reduce overhang and the Birch is not worthy of a TPO. The Council's position should therefore be one of no objections.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",

Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor repeat works carried out to ensure adequate light levels to the property and retain trees at appropriate size.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe tree in question is a large mature oak and the only mature tree cover on the property itself. It constitutes a part of the green corridor on the Upper Brighton Road and contributes significantly to the appearance of the conservation area due to its high visibility to the public and its subsequent public amenity value. It has been maintained over the years with a greater emphasis on reducing shade within the property and as such now has a heavier canopy over the road. The owner complains that the tree has been shedding branches and that these were not only deadwood but also live limbs and that this shedding is fairly regular and risks causing damage to the house itself and danger to its inhabitants, however no evidence of limb loss can be seen or has been provided and neither has a technical report been provided by an Arborist substantiating that there is anything wrong with the tree. There is also no evidence of existing property damage and permission cannot be granted for the removal of such a tree on the basis of possibility. It is plausible that the tree may have shed a higher number of small branches due to the two particularly long dry summers we have experienced. If this is the case then carrying out reduction works should help to mitigate this issue and reduce the demand that a larger crown exerts upon the tree whilst also reducing wind loading and likelihood of damage or limb loss due to storm events. It will also give an opportunity to reshape the tree appropriately and remove any deadwood or limbs that are obviously prone to failure.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse & grant lesser works as follows:\r\rT.35 Oak - Remove lowest primary limb extending over A243 (Upper Brighton Road) back to branch collar at main trunk. Crown lift secondary growth of remaining canopy to 2m above ridge line of house and match throughout. Reduce upper crown by 3m, laterally reduce crown over road to south by 2-3m and laterally reduce crown over property to North by 2m, reshaping to give natural evenly balanced crown shape with all cuts made to suitable growth points and all deadwood and problematic secondary growth prone to failure removed.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe Lime at 28 Gibbon Road was last pollarded in 2014-15 around the same time as planning permission was granted to build a new dwelling on the site. These works would not have caused any issues to the tree and the developer worked hard to ensure that the tree was not damaged during the course of development along with specialist foundations on the front elevation. Unfortunately during the early days of the development when it was still going through the planning process, a utility company for gas and electrics entered the site and carried out works to provide the site with services. During the process they dug down into the root protection area of the tree fairly close to the trunk and severed some fairly major roots in order to lay their new service lines. As the tree is subject to a TPO the Council would normally have taken immediate legal action over this, but unfortunately utility companies are exempt from having to apply for permission in law, they are termed a 'statutory body' and the Council cannot take action against them for harming a protected tree.\r\rSo moving on, the only thing the Council could do was permit works to repollard and wait and hope that the tree would recover. Early signs were good and there was a profusion of initial growth. Unfortunately though this never happened in the upper crown, only in the lower crown and trunk in the form of epicormic growth. This is very likely due to entrenchment as the tree is attempting to survive by shutting down support to the upper limbs and promoting growth to the lower limbs and trunk. It is very unlikely though that the tree will ever substantially recover at this point and the upper crown will most likely die off completely and then rot away opening the main trunk to cavities and central decay. This was not known until I saw the latest photos of the tree submitted in support of the current application.\r\rAlthough this application was originally for repollarding the tree, in the light of the above, I have spoken with the owners about removal including of the stump and planting a replacement tree in fresh top soil. They have agreed to this and as such my recommendation is to permit felling via this application with a condition to plant a replacement.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove Fell with condition for replacement tree; Prunus sargentii.\r",
