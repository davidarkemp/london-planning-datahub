    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and the Royal Borough of Kingston CIL (KCIL).  \rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or Â£2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \r\rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the CIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk <mailto:mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk> or phone 0208 547 5002.\r\rShould you wish to seek 'self build' exemption from CIL please refer to the Council's website Ref: https://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200380/community_infrastructure_levy\r",

Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are largely acceptable with the exception of T.4.

The photo is also clear enough to demonstrate that the canopy is still healthy with good growth at the time the photo was taken. As the tree is clearly covered by the TPO and no reason or evidence has been provided for it's removal, this element should be refused.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse & grant lesser works as follows:\r\rT.2 Malus - Reduce crown to previous pruning points.\rT.3 Pittosporum - Reduce by 50% and clear from property by 2m (Exempt).\rT.5 Maple - Remove dead branch over road.\rT.6 Elm - Fell (dead).\r",
