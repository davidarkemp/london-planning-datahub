    "That the applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that the conditions, as noted above, are discharged - subject to the following provision\r\rAside from essential fixings, the screen(s) shall be constructed entirely of, and retained in, obscured glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "You have been granted planning permission to build a residential extension.  When undertaking demolition and/or building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  Furthermore, please ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction of the development hereby approved are properly washed and cleaned to prevent the passage of mud and dirt onto the adjoining highway. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation.  For further information and advice, please contact - Environmental Health Department Pollution Section.",
    "Please provide a copy of a site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red, showing at least two road frontages and a North point.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works to T.3 are acceptable and minor in nature, however the applicant seeks 2m clearance between the magnolia and the house and this is too great a lateral reduction and would result in a very one sided tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
