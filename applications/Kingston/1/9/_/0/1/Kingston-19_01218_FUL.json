    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendments to planning permission reference: 21/02121/HOU:\r- Reduction of two-storey rear extension\r- Changes to fenestration and roof level\r\rThe proposed changes represent minor alterations to the external appearance of the dwelling, including reduction to the scale of the two-storey rear extension and reconfiguration of the arrangement of the rooflights and solar panels on the roof of the front elevation.\r\rThe proposed alterations would see the middle section of the proposed rear extension at first floor level removed altogether.\r\rThe rear extension at first floor would otherwise remain unchanged. The removal of the mid-section of the first floor rear extension would necessitate some internal reconfigurations to the accommodation including repositioning of an en-suite and removal of a side-facing window formerly serving an ensuite to the side and externally would result in the change from a central pitched gable feature to a central dormer with timber cladding. The mid-section of the ground floor rear extension would be fitted with a roof lantern and the existing dormer to the first floor at the rear would be retained with timber clad to match existing elevational treatment. One rooflight to the rear would be reduced in size but be retained in the position as originally approved. To the front elevation, the proposals include a reconfiguration of the arrangement of the rooflights and solar panels on the roof of the front elevation.\r\rOfficers consider the proposals would not result in a material harmful effect on the character and appearance of the dwelling or original design intent, nor have a detrimental impact to the amenity afforded to the future occupants. Officers are similarly satisfied that the proposed amendments would not give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the development from the streetscene or to neighbouring amenities. \r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendment is considered to be non-material and it is recommended that the application be granted.\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear extension with installation of 4no solar panels and associated changes to fenestration\r\rConsultation\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on Flooding; and,\r- The impact of the development on Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officer Comment:  With regards to neighbouring amenity, the principal properties to be considered are No. 30 and No. 34 Hardman Road. Policy Guidance 33 (Single Storey Rear Extensions)of the Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. In all cases, the following guidance applies:\r-If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased.\r-In all cases, at least 50% of the rear garden should remain.\r-Extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth.\r-Extensions with a flat roof should not exceed 3m in height.\r-Extensions with a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height.\r-Extensions with a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height.\r\rNo. 30 Hardman Road has already been extended as has No. 36. This would usually allow for an extension to exceed 3.5m in depth. However, with regards to No. 34 Hardman Road, officers note that this property does not benefit from a rear extension. It is noted that the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window or No. 34 Hardman Road in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given that scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe applicant is advised to resubmit with sufficient evidence to demonstrate that Policy Guidance 17 and 33 of the RBK Residential Design guide has been taken into account.  https://www.kingston.gov.uk/downloads/file/102/residential-design-spd\r\rAnother material planning consideration is the provision of adequate amenity space for both existing and future occupants. Officers note that the property already benefits from a large outbuilding to the rear of the garden. The proposed rear extension would further reduce the remaining amenity space to below current external amenity standards.\r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rPart A of Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that \"In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users, all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they: \r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r  a) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r  b) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point\r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread\r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rOfficers Comments: No Fire Statement has been submitted to demonstrate how the proposed development addresses the requirements of Part A of Policy D12 of the London Plan (2021). Therefore, it has not been demonstrated that the proposals would achieve the highest standards of fire safety.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey full width rear extension following the demolition of an existing rear and side extension.\r\rConsultation\rNo representations have been received in response to the public consultation.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst not strictly following the guidance in the SPD, the proposed development is considered to nonetheless be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the size of the plot coupled with the distance from boundaries It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities. \r\rPlanning decisions should ensure that developments: will function well and add to the overall quality of the area; are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; are sympathetic to local character and history; and establish a strong sense of place. \r\rPermission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, taking into account and local design standards or style guides in plans or supplementary planning documents. Conversely, where the design of a development accords with clear expectations in plan policies, design should not be used by the decision-maker as a valid reason to object to development. \r\rAt the regional level, the London Plan requires that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. It should improve an area's visual or physical connection with natural features. In areas of poor or ill-defined character, development should build on the positive elements that can contribute to establishing an enhanced character for the future function of the area. \r\rArchitecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape. It should incorporate the highest quality materials and design, appropriate to its context. \r\rAccordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development: \r\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character \r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment \r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality \r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\" \r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings \rThe most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following: \r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy \r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing \r- Landscape setting and features \r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings \r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary \r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc. \rThe Council's Residential Design SPD provides further in-depth guidance. Policy Guidance 29 (Materials and Detailing) states that: \r- Developers will be expected to demonstrate that they have considered the choice of materials and design detailing of those buildings that they consider represent the prevailing character of the streetscene or local area. \r- A preference should be given to the use of prevailing materials and details used in the surrounding local area unless it can be demonstrated that the choice of materials or use of design features in a proposal for residential development would enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene. \r- Care should be taken to ensure the replication of detailing or materials present in the street scene of local area represents an authentic synthesis of local architectural styles that compliment those of the host building or surrounding area. \r\rDevelopment proposals which include the use of materials or detailing which is out of context or is lacking in imagination or character will be discouraged. \r\rNPPF provisions: It is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. Chapter 16 of the National Planning Policy Framework, 2021 at para 195 sets out that the local planning authority should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset... They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset's conservation and any aspect of the proposal. \r\rParas 194-198 sets out the framework for decision making in planning applications relating to heritage assets and this application takes into account the relevant considerations in these paragraphs. \r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy 1.1 of the Council's Adopted Development (or Core) Strategy, (Core Strategy), and policy 7C of the Council's Adopted Development Management Development Plan Document, (DPD), seek to ensure that new development conserves the significance of heritage assets. Development should be sympathetic in its materials and architectural detailing and the introduction of designs or materials which undermine the significance of heritage assets should be avoided. More broadly, policies D4 and D8 of the London Plan 2021 collectively seek to ensure that new development is informed by and complements its surroundings. \r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rHistoric England's listing record sets out (NO. 8a, together with No's 6 and 8 Church Street): \"Late C16 or early C17. Originally a public house, divided into three shops in the later C19. Two storeys, three bays wide. Timber framed with jettied upper floor. Modern shop fronts on the ground floor. Square headed sash windows to two left hand bays. Other modern oriel. The upper floors rendered in the C19. No.6 also has some C20 false timbering and a modern oriel bay window. Tiled roof with chimney stack between Nos. 6 and 8.\"\r\rThe Council's Supplementary Planning Document titled, \"Shopfronts and Shopsigns\" (2005) provides guidance on signage for historic buildings. The SPD for shopfronts and shopsigns states \"any illuminated fascia sign on historic buildings should preserve the character and appearance of the building and area. Effective and acceptable forms of illuminations are those where the light fitting is concealed and include: tubes encased in trough housings, uplighters or downlighters which should be carefully located so that the spread of light is controlled and not overbright; or internally-illuminated individual letters or characters in the form of tubes encased with a translucent face and solid/opaque sides or vice versa, or solid characters raised with tubes beneath to create a 'halo' effect.\" \r\rThe application proposes the removal of the existing fascia boxing and replacement with traditional fascia. Officers consider this to be a positive improvement given that the existing box fascia is an overly deep, incongruous feature to the building and wider street scene. \r\rThe shopfront will be largely retained, keeping the same structure with a door to the right hand side and a timber-framed glazed window to the left. The existing door is proposed to be replaced with a full height timber framed door. The shopfront is proposed to be painted soft blue (i.e. Farrow and Ball Lulworth No.89) and a linear band of black and white ceramic tiles is proposed to the foot of the shop unit. Officers note the objection raised by Kingston Town CAAC with regards to the ceramic tiling with comments that this element of the proposals is out of keeping with the conservation area. Officers do not consider that the ceramic tiling is of an extent or design so as to constitute material harm or difference to the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area in terms of its visual impact, and the ceramic tile banding is found in this instance to appropriately tie in with the overall design intent of the proposed shop unit refit. \r\rThe proposals also include the installation of fascia signage to the front elevation and the addition of a projecting sign. The proposed fascia sign would comprise of individually fixed black acrylic 3D letters and clear acrylic sides internally illuminated at a level of 350 cd/m2 and the proposed projecting sign would comprise of a white painted square metal sheet with three rows of powder coated aluminium black glasses as commercial logo.\r\rThe new advertisements are considered appropriate in their style, form and design given the heritage setting and designation of the application site. The signage is considered to be of a good-quality which is not considered to harmfully impact upon the character of the area within the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area, nor result in harm to visual amenity or the appearance and special interest of this Grade-II listed building. \r\rHighway Safety\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree. \r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rLocal Planning Authorities are expected to have regard to its effect upon the safe use and operation of any form of traffic or transport on land (including the safety of pedestrians), on or over water, or in the air. Public safety considerations, the second arm of control over advertisements, do not arise very frequently. However, when it can be shown that signs would be confused with traffic signals or the visibility of drivers is impaired, a solid and sustainable ground for refusal of Advertisement Regulation consent is provided. \r\rThe proposed projecting advertisement would not be illuminated, however the fascia signage would be illuminated to 350cd/m2. It is considered given the level of illuminance and position of the building in a pedestrianised zone of the town centre that it would not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety. The proposed signage is therefore in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposed development would provide for the display of advertisements to the ground floor commercial unit at 8A Church Street, Kingston. It is considered that the proposed signage and shopfront alterations are acceptable resulting in no material harm to the character and appearance of the designated Grade-II listed building, nor on the wider Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. \r\rThe proposals would not have any material effect on highway safety. \r\rTherefore, it is considered that the proposed development would be in accordance with paragraph 200 of the NPPF 2021, policies D4 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade-II Listed Building and Conservation Area, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the heritage asset as per the requirements of the NPPF 2021.\r\rRecommendation \rThat listed building consent should be GRANTED.\r",

    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\r6x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and one representation has been received, highlighting support for the application.\r\r\rPlanning History\r10/12821/HOU- Erection of a single storey rear extension with rooflights- GRANTED 16.02.2011\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development;\rThe impact upon heritage assets; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact on the public highway.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Note: The application includes the erection of a front porch extension. The proposed porch would project 1.5 metres to the front of the dwelling and is of a similar design to the existing porch at no.19 Cardinal Avenue. Officers consider the proposed development, would have no detrimental impact on the character and appearance of the streetscene, host property, or the surrounding area.\r\rNon- Designated Heritage Assets\rParagraphs 194 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\rThe site comprises a terraced dwelling, located in the Tudor Estate Area of Special Character. The application site is not in a conservation area, but is within an area of special local character. The host building is therefore is not a heritage asset but a non-designated heritage asset.\rParagraph 203 of NPPF applies to non-designated heritage assets and it is stated in this paragraph that:-\r\"The effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\"\rAs noted above, officers consider that the proposed development would not result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore in accordance with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rOfficers Note: The application includes the erection of a front porch extension. would cause no significant increase in loss of daylight, sense of enclosure or loss of outlook to the adjoining properties at no.19 or no.23 Cardinal Avenue.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would include the construction of a porch to the front of the property. However, the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would still be sufficient to accommodate one space for on-site parking. The PTAL for this part of Cardinal Avenue, is 1b. Taking into account the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, which are up to 1.5 spaces per dwelling, for an Outer London PTAL 1 - 2, 3+ bedroom dwelling, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal, given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a flat within a detached property. The site is located within Riverside North Conservation Area.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 4 objections were received, but 2 were not received within the statutory consultation period. The 2 objections received within the statutory consultation periods relate to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r\rThe concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rKingston Town CAAC - Objection (Objection. We objected to the recent alterations to 1 Albany Mews, next door in this detached block of four flats. However, those alterations are minor & partially screened from public view by landscaping compared to this planning application. The application, including its extended porch, wrap around bay, front dormer & other new windows, would overwhelm the host property, jar with its neighbours all of which remain largely in their original state, be clearly visible from the public highway & detract significantly from the character & appearance of the conservation area. It should therefore be refused.)\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Fire Safety Assessment.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed front/side wraparound extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, however it would have a modest height, appropriate roof form and materiality to match the existing property, and as such officers consider that it would appear a proportionate and appropriate addition to the host property. \r\rOfficers note that the Kingston Town CAAC has objected to the proposal based on the uniformity of the block of 4 flats. While this objection is noted, officers note that the proposed extension has been designed to appear in keeping with approved application ref: 20/00155/HOU on the adjoining property No. 3 Albany Mews. While 3 Albany Mews does have a more limited impact on the streetscene, officers consider that the proposal would appear very subordinate and would not overwhelm the host property or detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rIn terms of design, Officers acknowledge that the proposed development would deviate from the original design of the wider block, however, the proposal is sympathetic to the original design and other permitted extensions. As such, overall the development would not harm the character of the host property nor would it harm the character of the wider area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the subordinate nature of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a minor residential extension to the existing residential accommodation officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rFlood Risk Assessment\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as a linear area whose form and mature landscape is influenced by the River Thames, alongside which lie ancient riverside estates, important 19th century public works that established Canbury Gardens, a group of large Victorian/Edwardian houses and late Victorian boathouses fronting the river.\r\rAs noted above, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Riverside North Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. As previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the represenations have been carefully considered, however, overall Officers conclude that the proposed development would be in general accordance with the, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "\rApplication Site\rThe application site is occupied by a substantial two storey detached residential dwelling and is located within the Southborough Conservation Area- a designated heritage asset.\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of single-storey side/rear extension including replacement of existing front side extension roof and associated changes to the fenestration.\r\rThis proposal follows an earlier scheme (21/03744/HOU) which was refused for the following reasons:\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed development would preserve or enhance the Southborough Conservation Area and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling, or the surrounding area and would not result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed first floor side extension would comply with BRE Guidance in relation to the ground floor habitable rooms in the eastern elevation of No. 51 Woodlands Road and would not result in in an unacceptable loss of daylight and or sunlight and that the raised patio area would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the same neighbouring occupiers in terms of privacy and outlook.

Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals affecting heritage assets, and their settings, should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to the assets' significance and appreciation within their surroundings. The cumulative impacts of incremental change from development on heritage assets and their settings should also be actively managed. Development proposals should avoid harm and identify enhancement opportunities by integrating heritage considerations early on in the design process.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed ground floor side extension by way of its siting would not be visible from the street and is of an acceptable scale and depth, with a pitched roof and materials to match the existing garage. It would also be in alignment with the existing garage.\r\rTo the rear the proposed extension would also be modest in scale and depth, setback from the property boundaries with a flat roof and large glazed windows and doors to the side and rear elevations.  \r\rSufficient detail has been submitted regarding the proposed window to the rear which would be of a different design to those on the front elevation and would be in keeping with the host dwelling and surrounding Conservation Area and would not result in any harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset.\r\rTo the front of the property it is proposed to change the two existing pitched roof elements of the single storey structure, to a flat roof form and to convert the existing single garage and study into two garages which would feature a large garage door which are considered acceptable. The heritage statement specifies the use of traditional brickwork and use of other appropriate mat external materials for the garage door and fenestration in keeping with the host dwelling, surrounding Conservation Area and would not result in any harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset.\r\rThe proposed first floor extension would be set back from the main front elevation, and the ground floor below, with a roof form and fenestration to match the host dwelling. This aspect of the proposed development would appear both proportionate and subordinate when viewed from the streetscene. It is considered that sufficient details have been provided in relation to the fenestration changes to the front elevation.\r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the proposed development would preserve and enhance the Southborough Conservation Area and would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the host dwelling, the surrounding area and would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. The proposed development is therefore in accordance with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Paragraph 202 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 and HC1 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed scale and siting of the proposed development at ground floor level are considered to have an acceptable impact on neighbouring properties, as would the proposed changes to the front elevation in terms of fenestration details and roof design. Officers note that although glazing is proposed to the side elevation of the proposed rear extension, there is an existing conservatory in this location and the impacts would be no greater than the current situation. \r\rThe proposed first floor side extension would be modest in scale, and compliance with BRE Guidance has been demonstrated in relation to the ground floor habitable rooms in the eastern elevation of No. 51 Woodlands Road with regards to daylight and or sunlight. The proposed development would therefore result in an acceptable impact on the amenities of this neighbouring occupier, in accordance with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy 2012.\r\rAlthough the proposal would introduce new windows to the ground floor side elevation, these would be sufficiently setback from the site boundary to No.51 Woodlands and further screened by the existing boundary treatment. A condition will ensure appropriate boundary treatment is retained to this area of the site.  \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, there is sufficient space for provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r\r",
