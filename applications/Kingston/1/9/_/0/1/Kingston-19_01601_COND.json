We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government."
