    "The proposed boundary treatment owing to its overall height, length and finish, would provide an unsuitable boundary treatment which would have a stark and imposing presence within the existing streetscene which consists of lower set boundaries or hedging. The proposal is therefore contrary to guidance contained within policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) and contrary to the Local Plan Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guidance (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed boundary treatment would result in reduced inter-visibility between pedestrians and users of the adjoining vehicle access to the detriment of pedestrian safety, contrary to policy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) and contrary to the Local Plan Supplementary Planning Document Residential Design Guidance (Adopted July 2013).",
