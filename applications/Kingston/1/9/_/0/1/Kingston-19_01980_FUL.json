    "Consultation Responses\r\rFlood Risk & Drainage Officer: No comments received\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No comments received.\r\rSite and Surroundings\r\rThe application site comprises a four storey building known as Hanover House, situated on the west side of the High Street, New Malden. The building appears to be commercial at the ground floor level with residential accommodation above.\r\rThe application site is located within New Malden District Centre. The site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 4 (good).\r\rProposal\r\rErection of single storey rear, first floor rear extension above the existing flat roof of the commercial unit below to create 1 no 2-bed flat which will be accessed via a new stair enclosure at the rear. Erection of rear extension in existing building to convert existing first floor 1-bed flat into 2-bed flat which will continue to be accessed from the entrance doorway on New Malden High Street.\r\rRelevant History\r\rA number of recent planning permission and advertisement consents have been granted in relation to the ground floor commercial unit. Regarding the residential accommodation above, the following planning permissions are most relevant:\r\r21/03870/FUL - Erection of single storey rear extensions at first floor level above the existing flat roof of commercial unit below to create 2no.x new studio flats, which will be accessed via new stair enclosure at rear. - Refused 03.03.2022\r98/4176/FUL - Conversion of existing third floor flat to 2 self contained studio flats with elevational alterations - Granted 10/11/1998\r98/4071/FUL - Conversion of offices on first and second floors 2 one bedroom and 2 two bedroom flats, alterations to third floor to form 2 bedroom flat and elevational alterations - Granted 01/12/1998\r\rAssessment\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Core Strategy seeks to increase housing delivery within the borough. The proposal provides for 2 x studio flats and the conversion of an existing 1 bedroom flat into a 2 bedroom flat. The provision of additional housing is considered to be acceptable in principle. \r\rIt should be noted that currently the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. As such, paragraph 11 of the NPPF stipulates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impact, as  required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF. The planning balance assessment will form the last section of this report.\r\rAgent of Change\r\rPolicy D13 (Agent of Change) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that development should be designed to ensure that established noise and other nuisance-generating uses remain viable and can continue or grow without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them. Development proposals should manage noise and other potential nuisances by: \rensuring good design mitigates and minimises existing and potential nuisances generated by existing uses and activities located in the area exploring mitigation measures early in the design stage, with necessary and appropriate provisions including ongoing and future management of mitigation measures secured through planning obligations \rseparating new noise-sensitive development where possible from existing noise-generating businesses and uses through distance, screening, internal layout, sound-proofing, insulation and other acoustic design measures\r\rPolicy D13 sets out that: 'Boroughs should not normally permit development proposals that have not clearly demonstrated how noise and other nuisances will be mitigated and managed.'\r\rIt is noted that the ground floor of the site is in commercial use, along with adjoining Dawson House and neighbouring buildings also. There also appears to be a number of air conditioning units, plant and other equipment in close proximity to the boundary of the application site. The existing servicing area for the ground floor commercial unit would be retained and would be directly beneath the proposed balconies.\r\rThe second reason for refusal of application ref: 21/03870/FUL is as follows:\r\rInsufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed dwellings would not prejudice the ongoing viability of neighbouring businesses and would not result in unreasonable restrictions being placed on them, contrary to Policy D13 of the London Plan (2021) and the NPPF (2021).\r\rIn response to this reason for the refusal the applicant has amended the scheme to remove a balcony from the rear elevation and glazing has been changed from full height doors to casement windows. A fixed planter below the window cill has been incorporated for noise attenuation purposes and it is stated that mitigations such as sound insulation and sound dampening laminate would be incorporated.\r\rAs with the previous refusal, no Noise Assessment or other evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that the proposed flats would not prejudice the ongoing operation of neighbouring businesses without unreasonable restrictions being placed on them. No technical details of the proposed noise mitigations have been submitted and the proposed habitable room windows would nevertheless in close proximity to plant, equipment and the shared boundaries with neighbouring businesses. \r\rIt is noted that one of the areas previously indicated to be servicing/parking for the ground floor commercial unit would be converted to car parking for the proposed flat. It is unclear whether the reduction in servicing areas would adversely impact the ongoing operation of the business. The proposal therefore fails in this regard.\r\rCharacter & Design\r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) setes out that: \"Development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design.\r\rAlong the southern shared boundary, the first floor rear extension would be approximately 13.6m in depth, have a maximum height of 7.3m (when measured from ground floor level) or approximately 3.2m from the first floor level to the roof. The proposed extensions would span the width of the property at the rear elevation (approximately 10.9m) with a flat roof form. The proposals include an enclosed terrace of approximately 20sqm in size which would abut the northern site boundary. The terrace would be accessible to the extended 2x bedroom flat only.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extensions would be situated to the rear of Hanover House and would not be visible from High Street. The proposed development would have a bulky and blocky appearance when viewed from Sussex Place to the rear, however, it would be of a similar appearance to adjoining Dawson House and would therefore not have any significant adverse impact on the character of the area.\r\rWhile the proposal would not enhance the character and appearance of the area, it is noted that development off Sussex Place is piecemeal and comprises a mixture of residential and commercial uses. Within this context, it is considered that the proposal development would be of an acceptable appearance. \r\rStandard of Accommodation\r\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rThe first reason for refusal of application ref: 21/03870/FUL is as follows: \r\rIt has not been demonstrated through the submission of cogent evidence that the proposed dwellings would receive sufficient levels of daylight and sunlight and would not be subject to unacceptable levels of noise. The proposed flats would have a poor quality outlook and would have insufficient amenity space. The proposed units would therefore be of a poor standard of accommodation contrary to Policies DM10 and DM11 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012), Policy D6 of the London Plan (2021), the Kingston Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2021). \r\rIn terms of amendments, the applicant has incorporated a larger terrace for the extended flat while the proposed additional flat would have a new terrace of 5.4m2 in size and a larger rear terrace which would be partly recessed.\r\rNo Daylight & Sunlight Assessment has been submitted. While it is noted that the additional terrace areas would provide additional aspect, it is considered that the proposed flats would remain heavily reliant on neighbouring properties for their outlook. The outlook for the extended flat would be onto the 4.2m deep terrace with the proposed additional flat beyond. \r\rAs it stands, significant concerns remain as to the levels of daylight, sunlight and quality of outlook. \rAs is noted in the 'Agent of Change' section above, no Noise Assessment or other evidence has been submitted to demonstrate that noise levels for the proposed flats would be acceptable, given the close proximity of commercial uses below and adjoining the site.\r\rBoth flats would meet or exceed the minimum space standards in relation to Gross Internal Area (GIA) and each would be provided with at least 10sqm of private amenity space in the form of roof terraces. The proposed extensions would provide 2.5m floor to ceiling height.  It is unclear what levels of daylight or direct sunlight (if any) the proposed terraces would receive.\r\rOverall, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed flat and extended flat would receive adequate levels of daylight, sunlight and would not be subject to unacceptable levels of noise from neighbouring businesses. Furthermore, the extended flat would have an especially poor quality of outlook. Officers are unable to conclude that the proposed development would provide a good standard of accommodation for occupants. The first reason for refusal has not been addressed.\r\rUnit Mix\r\rPolicy DM13 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 states that the Council will ensure that the housing delivered is of high quality and the most appropriate type.  The Policy also states that new residential development is expected to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types.  The Policy requires that 30% of the proposed units should be 3 or more bedrooms (which are capable of family occupation) unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable. \r\rThe fourth reason for refusal is as follows:\r\rThe proposed development would fail to incorporate a mix of unit sizes and would fail to provide any 3 or more bedroom units and it has not been demonstrated that the provision of 3 or more bedroom units would be unviable, contrary to Policy DM13 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rThe previous proposal was for 2 studio flats and the extension of the existing 1 bedroom flat to turn it into a 2 bedroom flat. The current proposal is for 2x 2 bedroom flats (1 additional and 1 by way of extensions to an existing flat).\r\rWithin the above context, it is considered that the proposed development would provide a more appropriate unit mix. The fourth reason for refusal has been addressed.\r\rImpact on Neighbouring Residential Amenity\r\rThere appears to be residential accommodation at the first and second floor levels at Nos. 121 and 123 High Street to the north of the application site. However, any loss of daylight/sunlight and undue sense of enclosure would primarily affect what appear to be larger roof terraces at the rear. It is therefore unlikely that any adverse impact would be significant. \rWhile there would appear to be residential accommodation at the adjoining property Dawson House, there do not appear to be any habitable room windows which would be directly affected by the proposals. While there would be some loss of privacy to flats to the west at Charnwood Close, this impact would be minor as it would be largely onto communal areas/accessways.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposal would not have any significant adverse impact on the amenities of neighbours.\rHighways & Parking \r\rThe proposed flats would not have any on-site car parking and the site is not located within a CPZ. The site is located within a PTAL 4 with good accessibility to public transport links. Subject to the proposed development being secured by legal agreement as 'car-free', that is precluding residents of the proposed flats applying for on-street car parking permits, in the event that a CPZ is brought into effect, it is considered that the proposal would be acceptable in terms of car parking provision. \r\rThe third reason for refusal is as follows:\r\rIt has not been demonstrated that there would be sufficient space on site to accommodate a secure cycle store and a waste and recycling store given the area to the rear is indicated as being in use for the servicing of the ground floor commercial unit, contrary to Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) and Policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rThe revised proposals include 1x car parking space for the use of the proposed flat. The proposed car parking space would be situated partially underneath the rear balcony in the area to front of the access to the stairwell.\r\rScaling off the submitted drawings and the area identified for car parking would be unable to provide a policy compliant car parking space (2.4m x 4.8m). No details have been submitted of secure cycle parking. A 140l bin store has been indicated adjacent to the car parking space. Insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that there would be sufficient space for separate recycling, municipal and food waste receptacles. Given the above, the proposed ground floor layout is likely to adversely impact pedestrian access to the proposed flat.\r\rOverall, insufficient information has been submitted to demonstrate that there would be sufficient space on site to accommodate a secure cycle store and a waste and recycling store. The proposed car parking space would not meet the minimum size requirements and is likely to obstruct access to the flat and to oversail the road to the rear and potentially obstruct and inconvenience other highway users.\r\rPlanning Balance/Conclusion\r\rThe proposal would provide a net increase of 1x Class C3 unit of accommodation and a total of 2x 2 bedroom flats on site; this would make a positive, albeit modest, contribution toward meeting the Council's housing targets.\r\rHowever the proposed flats would fail to provide a good standard of accommodation, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed flats would not prejudice the ongoing development of neighbouring businesses and  it has not been demonstrated that on-site secure cycle parking and waste storage could be accommodated for the proposed flat.\rOverall, it is considered that the adverse impacts identified above would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits of the scheme. It is therefore recommended that planning permission is refused.\r",

It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in regards to set in from the shared boundaries, however it would have a modest depth and as such would appear a subordinate addition to the host property.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed piggyback extension would be appropriately set back from the front elevation and would extend no more than 1.3m in height, however it would be separated from the neighbouring properties by more than 2.1m on one side. While this is not recommended by the Residential Design SPD, it is not considered that the host property has a prominent position within the streetscene, and as such it is not considered that the proposed development would appear incongruous within the streetscene. In any case, it would appear an appropriate and proportionate addition to the host property. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed development would extend closer to the shared boundary with 102 Kings Road and would extend further in depth than the neighbouring property's existing rear elevation. While this is the case, officers note that the proposal would pass the 45-degree plan test in relation to the closest habitable window at ground and first floor level, and as such would not result in a loss of light/sunlight. Further given that 102 Kings Road sits within a wider plot than the surrounding properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not appear overbearing.\r\rOn the boundary with 106 Kings Road, the proposed developments would have a modest depth and as such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light.\r\rWhile additional openings are proposed to the rear elevation, officers consider that it would not offer dissimilar views to what is existing on the host property or properties within the immediate vicinity. However, it is noted that openings would be proposed at roof level on the side elevations, and given the close proximity to neighbouring properties, it is considered appropriate to impose a condition to ensure these openings are obscure glazed and non-opening below 1.7m above finished floor levels. \r\rTherefore, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Application Site\rThe application site is located on the northern side of the Griffin Centre which is immediately west of Market Place in the designated Kingston Town Centre.\r\rThe surrounding area is an area of mixed use. The site is located within the designated Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and the unit has a statutory listing (Grade II) as part of the group of buildings that form the Griffin Centre.\r\rThe Historic England Listing description is set out below:\r\"Chiesman's Store (formerly Hide's Store). A large modern department store, most of which is not of interest, but it contains some items of importance. In the basement, some flint walling and C17 brickwork. Inside the store, a fine mid C17 timber staircase from the Castle Hotel, which formerly occupied the site. Heavy square newels with carved, panelled sides and ball finials; strings carved with laurel leaves; heavy, moulded handrails; the space between handrails and strings filled with heavy foliage and roses, within which are some human figures.

[On the south side facing alleyway to back yard]. Listed solely for the items described.\"\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks retrospective advertisement consent for the display of 13no's hand-painted fascia signs, 1no. non-illuminated projecting sign, 2no. illuminated menu boxes and 2no. hand-painted stall-riser signs. \r\rAn accompanying Listed Building Consent and Full Planning application have been submitted for the same proposals (plus other shopfront alterations) under reference: 22/02718/LBC and 22/02669/FUL.\r\rCONSULTATIONS\r23no. surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the application.  No responses were received.   \r\rKingston Town Centre Conservation Area Advisory Committee: No objection.\r\rHistoric England: No view expressed on the proposal. Authorise delegated determination.\r\rASSESSMENT\rThe main issue to assess in the consideration of this application is the impact that the development would have on the character of the area and the streetscene and impact upon heritage assets and impact upon highway safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rParagraph 125 of the NPPF 2021 states that the creation of high quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study 2011 and the Residential Design SPD 2013, ensuring that new development:\r-\tRecognises distinctive local features and character;\r-\tHas regard to the historic and natural environment;\r-\tHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality;\r-\tAccords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"; and,\r-\tRelates well and connects to its surroundings.\r\rPolicy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r-\tPrevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy;\r-\tPrevailing density of the surrounding area;\r-\tScale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing;\r-\tLandscape setting and features;\r-\tPlot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings;\r-\tBuilding line build-up, set-back and front boundary; and,\r-\tTypical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe proposed works consist of the installation of new advertising signage. \r\rTwo illuminated rectangular menu boards are proposed either side of the entrance door fronting Market Place, one non-illuminated projecting sign to be installed on the pre-existing bracket and 13no. hand-painted signs to the Market Place and Griffin Arcade elevations.\r\rOverall, the design and materials are considered to be visually unobtrusive and are considered to both respect and be in keeping with the host building and the surrounding streetscene, thereby complying with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSections 16 and 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) state that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposals are considered to be sympathetic to the scale, mass, height and aesthetic attributes of the designated heritage asset of the Grade-II listed building. The level of intervention on the fabric of the Grade II building itself is minimal, thereby preserving the character defining elements of the historic fabric, retaining the authenticity of the building. The impact of the proposals is considered to result in \"less than substantial harm\" to the heritage asset. \r\rHighway Safety\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree. \r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rLocal Planning Authorities are expected to have regard to its effect upon the safe use and operation of any form of traffic or transport on land (including the safety of pedestrians), on or over water, or in the air. Public safety considerations, the second arm of control over advertisements, do not arise very frequently. However, when it can be shown that signs would be confused with traffic signals or the visibility of drivers is impaired, a solid and sustainable ground for refusal of Advertisement Regulation consent is provided. \r\rMost of the signage would not be illuminated, however the two rectangular blackened steel finished menu boards either side of the entrance door would be static internally illuminated to a level of 50cd/m2. In addition, the fascia sign is externally static illuminated to a level of 500cd/m2. It is considered given the level of illuminance and position of the building in a pedestrianised zone of the town centre, that it would not result in a distraction to highway users and would not prejudice highway safety. The proposed signage is therefore in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposed development would provide for the display of advertisements to Unit 2, The Griffin Centre, Kingston. It is considered that the proposed signage is acceptable resulting in no harm to the character and appearance of the building or wider conservation area. \r\rThe proposals would not have any material effect on highway safety. \r\rThe proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which otherwise indicate that advertisement consent should be refused. Therefore, it is recommended that advertisement consent be granted. \r\rRecommendation \rThat advertisement consent should be GRANTED.\r\r\r",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey side, rear and front extension with installation of garage doors. Second floor side extension. Hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front and 1no side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r21 Neighbouring properties have been notified and 2 objections from 1 address have been received stating;\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r\rOfficers will consider these comments alongside their assessment.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that several properties along Alexandra Drive benefit from 2 storey side extensions. \r\rPolicy Guidance 36 of the residential design SPD states that On semi-detached properties proposed side extensions should\r- respect the symmetry of the adjoining semi-detached property;\r- not exceed 50% the width of the original house;\r- be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps;\r- The roof line should be set down from that of the original house by a minimum of 500mm; and,\r- The front elevation should be set-back by at least 500mm from the front of the house.  \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed hip to gable addition will result in loss of symmetry between the properties. It is also acknowledged that this is a common feature within the street scene and numerous properties have hip to gable extensions that were  constructed under permitted development.\r\rThe proposed side extension would be less than half the width, set in at first floor from the boundary to maintain a gap and set down from the original roofline in compliance with the guidance. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  With regards to neighbouring amenity, The principal properties to be considered are No. 93 and No. 97 Alexandra Drive. With regards to No. 97, the proposed rear extension would extend approximately 4.8m from the existing rear elevation with proposed eaves height of 2.8m. This rear extension would in fill the area between No. 97 and the existing outrigger. Although officers note that the depth could be considered excessive, it is also noted that deeper extension has been permitted along Alexandra Drive and due to the limited eaves height at 2.8m and pitched roof, the proposed extension would be compliant with BRE Guidance in relation to daylight sunlight. With regards to No. 93, due to the existing situation and the existing adjoining garages, it is considered that the proposed rear extension would not lead to loss of light or an overbearing apperance. In relation to the proposed side extension, due to the set in at first floor level coupled with the large existing gap between the two properties, it is not considered the proposed development would adversely effect No. 93. Officers note the proposed side extension would have obscured glazed windows. This would be secured by condition should permission be granted to ensure privacy is maintained. Overall, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed dormer and hip-to-gable extension would not generally comply with the guidance in the Residential Design SPD (Dormer Windows) but could be constructed under permitted development. In addition, in the context of other houses in the street or wider area, this form of construction would not be unusual.\r\rThe proposed rear extension and garage conversion combined with the existing rear extension granted under planning permission ref: 29495 would have a total depth of over 6.5m, falling outside Policy guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD. Although officers acknowledge the proposed development would only be slightly visible from the streetscene (only it would be visible from the gardens of neighbouring properties), the width of the proposed rear extension and garage conversion combined would be an unacceptable addition to an already over developed area. \r\rIn addition, the proposed rear extension would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the host building, as it would be of similar depth and width as the original dwelling when considering planning permission ref: 29495. Therefore, overall, the proposed development is considered to be unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, massing and spacing. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A).
