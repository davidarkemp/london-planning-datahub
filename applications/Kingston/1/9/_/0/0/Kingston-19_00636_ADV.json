    "The proposed advertisement display by virtue of its size, siting and design would be visually intrusive creating an incongruous addition to the streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "In response to the provisions of Section 96A Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the application is to be assessed to ascertain as to whether the proposed changes constitutes a non-material amendment to the approved development.\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance (2014) states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. \rThe application propose an amendement to the cladding on the front elevation of the house but the plans provided also show changes to other elevations which officers deem to be material changes. For this reason the non material amendment is refused.\r",
    "Please provide a photograph of the tree.\r\rThis is required due to the current situation.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rExtremely small tree likely not even covered by the Conservation Area and to the rear of the property. No negative impact upon tree health or amenity and the Council decision should therefore be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
