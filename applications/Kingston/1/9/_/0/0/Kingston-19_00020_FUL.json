    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSeventeen neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers acknowledge that neighbouring property, No. 22 Cross Road benefits from a similar roof extension (16/13168/LDP 19.01.2017), as do others in the street. Whilst the roof extension at No. 22 was implemented under permitted development and does not benefit from planning permission, the proposed development under consideration in this case is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would have no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the host dwelling.  Whilst it would be clearly visible from Shortlands Road and parts of Cross Road, it would not be an unusal or incongruous addition to the roofscape and therefore would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

As such, they would not be readily, if at all, visible from any public vantage points and would have a negligible impact on the character and appearance of the area. In any case, the replacement of the existing windows with larger, glazed sliding doors is considered to be a typical contemporary alteration to a domestic building. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, located in the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area which derives its special architectural and historic interest as an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre  comprising of houses dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855. There are no Listed buildings within a 200 metre radius of the property.\r\rEleven neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - Objection unless revised. Details regarding windows on front elevation are unclear. Unsure if these are being replaced. If so requests that these are replaced with white sash windows to avoid harm to the Conservation Area. The proposed dormer would be visible from the road.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of neighbouring land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy DM12 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that the Council will: 'ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area' and preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the adjoining property No. 45 Grange Road already benefits from a similar type of roof extension (11/12296/HOU dated 27/07/2011 granted retrospective permission for a rear dormer extension with juliette balcony). The proposed rear dormer and hip to gable roof extension are in the case of No. 43 general compliance with Policy 39 of Residential Design Guide SPD and would improve the balance of the pair of semi detached properties. The rear dormer would not be highly visible within the street scene and would be a subordinate feature within the rear roof slope. It is therefore considered that the proposed dormer would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the rear dormer or hip to gable extension. The proposed roof lights would fit flush with the roof slope. Conservation style rooflights will be requested and secured by condition should permission be granted. It is considered that conservation style roof lights would not harm the character and appearance of the Conservation Area. In relation to the single storey rear extensions, officers also consider this would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. In relation to the front elevation fenestration, having reviewed the information submitted on the plans, design and access statement and application form it is clear there are no proposed works or changes to the windows.\r\rThe objection by the Conservation Area Advisory Committee is noted but given the small scale of the proposal and its location, where it would not be highly visible or prominent within the street scene, it is considered that the development would not result in any harm to the character or appearance of the Conservation Area or its significance. As the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of designated heritage assets, the test in paragraph 196 of the NPPF (2019) is not engaged.\r\rThe proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of the Conservation Area and would not cause any harm to its significance, thereby complying with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 and the NPPF (2019).\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would comply with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policies CS8, DM12 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019).",

    "The site comprises a detached property\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Highway Impact.\r\rThe development comprises the demolition of an existing rear extension and the erection of a full width rear extension, 3m deep, and a full length side extension, both single storey approx. 3m in height. The application also proposes a lanttern at the centre of the side extension. Included within the application is a change in fenestration of a first floor side window.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe side and rear extension would fill the width of the site, whilst not strictly in accordance with the SPD this would not cause material harm to the character and appearance of the host property, the area, or cause a detrimental impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties.\r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rThe proposed side extension would fill the gap at the side of the existing property in a similar fashion to the neighbouring property. Whilst available space for the parking of vehicles would be lost, there is ample space on the front drive for parking on-site. However, access to the rear of the property and to available space for cycle parking would be lost, a condition is imposed to address this concern and to ensure that opportunities for accessing sustainable modes of transport (cycling) is preserved.\r\rA condition is imposed to ensure that the proposed first floor side window would be obscurely glazed.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The application site adjoins the Metropolitan Open Land to the rear. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposal on the existing car parking and cycle parking facilities.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  It is acknowledged that the proposed part single part two storey side extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as the extension would not be set back from the front elevation and there is lack of separation gap. However, considering the existing situation, scale of the proposal and similar extensions on Alric Avenue, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. The proposed roof would be set down from the main roof line and would relate well to the host dwelling and the existing street scene. \r\rThe proposed modest scale part single storey rear extension finished with flat roof and roof lantern and installation of the new patio doors would appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the scale and siting of the proposed extensions, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.  \r\rThe proposal would meet BRE guidelines passing the 45 degree rule in relation to the adjoining properties. It is noted that the existing side window on the first floor side elevation at No. 85 Alric Avenue serves a bathroom, therefore the proposal would not result in an adverse impact on habitable windows. \r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rAs the proposal is for partial conversion of the garage, it is considered that there would be no impact on the existing cycle parking spaces. \r\rThe application site adjoins the Metropolitan Open Land to the rear. Given the scale and siting of the proposal and the size of the rear garden it is considered that the proposal would not have significant impact on the Metropolitan Open Land.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8, DM09 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

    "The application property is a two-storey semi-detached dwelling located on the north side of Bonner Hill Road, which is a well-established residential area. The property has a hipped roof finish, although the adjoining property at no. 73 Bonner Hill Road has implemented a hip-to-gable extension, so there is currently an imbalance to the appearance of the front elevations of the pair of properties. To the side of the property is a passageway that provides access to the rear, where an angled boundary fence reduces its width as it progresses to the rear. There are no windows within the side elevation of no. 77 Bonner Hill Road that face the boundary between the two properties.\r\rThere is no planning history that is relevant to this application.\r\rFour neighbouring properties were notified of the application, and no responses were received during the consultation period.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe application proposes a hip-to-gable extension together with a dormer to the rear with a Juliet balcony. A single storey side exension is also proposed. The Residential Design Guide advises against hip-to-gable extensions as such development can create an imbalance in the symmetry to semi-detached properties, such as this. However, the adjoining property at no. 73 has implemented such an extension so an imbalance already exists. This aspect of the application would re-introduce a symmetrical appearance and so there is no objection to this aspect of the development. There are also examples of hip-to-gable and rear dormer extensions at nos. 71 and 73, so there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the wider streetscene. \r\rThe application also includes the erection of a single storey extension to the side of the propety, that will infill a gap up to the side boundary with no. 77. The extension would be modest in size and appear as a subservient feature to the main dwelling, and have the appearance of a typical domestic extension. The development as a whole would utilise appropriate materials, which can be secured by way of an appropriately worded condition, and so the proposal would not have a detrimental impact upon the character and appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed side extension would be located adajacent to the boundary with no. 77 Bonner Hill Road, although there are no windows within the side elevation of the property that would be adversely affected in terms of outlook and/or loss of natural light. The presence of the extension would not have a dominating impact upon the amenity space of the neighbouring property, and the level of private amenity space at the application property would not be compromised. The application includes a Juliet Balcony within the rear elevation of the proposed dormer, and whilst this may enable views into neighbouring gardens, it is considered not to be any greater than what would be expected when properties are aligned in this manner in well-established residential areas. The side extension would also incorporate a flat roof finish that could potentially be used as an outdoor seating area/balcony. It is considered that any such use could increase noise disurbance and at neighbouring properties, and incorporate features such as railings that have not been considered as part of this application. A condition would be imposed to prevent any such use and in order to maintain an acceptable relationship with neighbouring properties.\r\rThe development would not have an impact upon bin storage facilities or off-street parking space, and the side extension would allow direct access from front to rear to maintain a secure cycle storage area.\r\rThe proposal would therefore comply with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) and therefore can be supported.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have be notified of the proposals and one representation has been received, raising the following summarised concerns:\r- Inappropriate design/layout.\r\rThe objection referred to above relates to party wall issues which is not a material planning consideration.  As such and should permission be granted, an informative would be added to the Decision Notice advising the applicant of their obligations concering party wall agreements.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note permission for a similar extension was granted at neighbouring property No. 40 Windsor Road (16/13162/HOU 19.01.2017). As the extension in this case would be set well back from the front elevation (by approximately 7.6m) it would have limited visibility from the street. It is also considered to be both proportionate and subordinate and would relate well to the host dwelling. As such, the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the nature the proposed development being considered as part of this application and both the existing rear extensions at No. 36 and No. 40 Windsor Road, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Condition 9 (Detailed Drainage System) - The RBK Flood Risk Officer has reviewed all information provided (including revised information) and is satisfied this condition can now be fully approved.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 9 (Detailed Drainage System) of planning permission 19/01813/FUL is hereby fully approved.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed utility wing extension would not be readily visible from any public vantage points since it would be set back significantly from the highway and screened by an intervening building. In any case, its design would respond well to that of the host dwelling and it would replace an existing structure of a similar footprint. The proposed study extension would depart from the design of the host dwelling insofar as it would have a flat roof however, the proposed materials would result in a high quality and historically sensitive finish. Having regard to these considerations, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rParagraph 197 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset. Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 builds on the policies of the NPPF, stating that development should identify, value, conserve, restore, re-use and incorporate heritage assets, where appropriate. At the local level, Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 set out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application building is locally listed and lies within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. As noted above, officers are satisfied that the proposal would result in extensions of a moderate scale and of a high quality finish. Consequently officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of either the locally listed host dwelling or the strategic area of special character.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extensions would be single storey and would be moderate in scale when considered in the context of the host dwelling. They would be well separated from neighbouring properties and as a result, officers are satisfied that they would have a very limited impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012).",

The extension would be single storey. Included in the application is an extended raised patio.\r\rThe proposed development would not have a detrimental impact by reason of loss of light to the neighbouring dwellings although it is noted that there is a land level change between garden areas but the length of the extension (towards No 49 - approx 2.5m) is minimal. Of concern however is the potential for increased overlooking provided by the extended patio area, to counter this a condition requiring a privacy screen to be erected has been imposed. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
