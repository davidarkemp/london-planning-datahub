This is indicative of weak branch unions where the pollard stanchion outgrows the potential strength that the union can afford. This is due to the length of the regrowth and of extensive decay in the remaining wood of the tree's scaffold branches which as an over-mature tree is suffering with.\nOn climbing the tree to inspect the main trunk and fork, it was more obvious that all the regrowth unions which constitute the entire crown are suffering from decay. Deep pockets of rotten wood are present and filled with rotten matter.\nThis will undoubtedly be compromising the strength of said unions and they too would be prone to tear out especially under inclement weather, such that we experienced last week.\nI would recommend felling this tree.\nNormally, I'd suggest removing the regrowth back to substantial and strong wood but this would leave very little behind since the trunk to the crown break is in the region of six to eight feet high. The remaining wood would not constitute an amenity value as a stump of four feet in height.\nI believe a good long term solution to be its removal and replacement with a standard sapling of another species that would be suitable for the position bearing in mind the proximity to a neighbouring house and gardens.\"\n\nReason for approval. \nThis application has been assessed by the Council's tree officer who has evaluated the works against the impact on tree health, visual amenity and the reasons given for the works.
