    "The proposed advertisement display by virtue of its size, siting and design would be visually intrusive creating an incongruous addition to the streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The application has been assessed in accordance with Section 96A Town and Country Planning Act 1990 to ascertain as to whether the proposed changes constitutes a non-material amendment to the development approved as part of application 18/14306/FUL.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance (2014) states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. \r\rThe application proposes a number of amendments to the elevations and roof of the house which officers consider to be material changes that would have to be assessed in accordance with the Development Plan.",
    "Please confirm description of proposed works \"T.1 Sycamore  - Fell\"",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works to trees at rear of property with no adverse impact upon tree health (with the exception of remiving the Ash sapling) and no harm to public amenity therefore warranting a Council response of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo Objections."
