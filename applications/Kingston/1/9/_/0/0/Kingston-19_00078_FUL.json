    "Application Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey detached dwelling, located on the northern side of Ullswater Crescent.\r\rThe site is also located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rProposal\r\rThe application seeks permission for raising roof height, erection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration of existing roof.\r\rPlanning History\r\r22/00921/HOU - Erection of rear dormer roof extension and installation of 2 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration to roof design. Refused for the following reason:\r\r'The proposed raising of the roof height and alteration to the roof design would appear  as an inappropriate and dominant addition to the host property, resulting in an incongruous appearance within the streetscene. This would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area and would result in harm to the significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. The proposed development would therefore conflict with Paragraph 203 of the NPPF, 2021, Policy Paragraph HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.'\r\rThe current scheme has reduced the raising of the roof height from 400mm to 250mm. Officers note that the supporting information states a raise in roof height of 200mm but the plans show 250mm.\r\rConsultation\r\r10 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rWhilst the proposed rear dormer itself is of an acceptable scale and external design, the proposed raise in roof height of 250mm, would alter the overall roof profile when viewed from the streetscene and result in one that would not be compatible with surrounding properties. With the exception of No.77 Ullswater Crescent, which is a result of a permission that predates the current Core Strategy and Residential Design SPD policy guidance, the roof profiles of properties with Ullswater Crescent appear mostly intact and consistent in their appearance. Furthermore, a recent permission for a rear dormer at No.63 (2200777/HOU) ensures the roof profile to the street scene remains intact. \r\rOfficers acknowledge the proposal reduces the roof height proposed in the earlier application however the roof profile when viewed from the street scene would still be altered.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers therefore consider that the proposed development would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rHeritage Assets\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 203 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rThe application site neither contains, nor forms part of any designated heritage assets. However, it does fall within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character (SASC), which is a non-designated heritage asset. The significance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill SASC relates to an area of fine houses and lodges set in a landscape of exceptional quality, which began as a series of small estates in the late 18th century.\r\rThe proposed raise and resultant change in the roof profile is not considered by officers to respect the prevailing character and appearance of properties in the immediate vicinity, and in particular the consistency in the roof profile and established character of properties as they appear to the street.\r\rHaving regard to the above officers consider the proposal would result in harm to the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill SASC. \r\r\r\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting and scale of the proposed development, it is not considered this part of the proposal would have any adverse impact on the amenities of the neighbouring properties at Nos.69 or 73 Ullswater Crescent.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy and Plans which demonstrate the provision of a suitable evacuation assembly point and fire safety measures within the building to comply with the London Plan. Officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r\r",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on 86 Willoughby Road. The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone. \r\rPlanning History\r\r22/01219/CPU - Erection of rear dormer roof extension with installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Associated changes to fenestration. Refuse on 06 Jun 2022.\r\rConsultations\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of an L-shaped dormer extension to the rear, as well as the installation of 2 no. rooflights to the front roofslope. Finally the application proposes the installation of three obscure glazed windows on the side elevation of the dwellinghouse. \r\rWhilst the proposed flat roof L-shaped dormer extension would not strictly conform to the recommendations of the Residential Design SPD, Officers note that the proposed development would not be uncharacteristic of this area of Willoughby Road. As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse or area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. Nevertheless, in the interest of the privacy of the neighbouring property at No. 88 Willoughby Road, Officers consider it appropriate to attach a condition to the permission in the event of an approval to ensure that the proposed new windows on the side elevation of the property are installed as obscure glazed and retained as such. \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site\rThe application site consists of a semi-detached two storey single dwellinghouse The surrounding area is predominately residential in character. The site is located within an Area of archaeological significance  and within Flood Zone 2. \r\rProposal\rErection of single-storey rear/side extension, new side porch and first floor rear extension.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals.  2 representations have been received objecting to the proposal on the following grounds:\r\rAbsence of first floor extensions in the vicinity of the application property;\rLoss of sunlight/daylight and outlook to neighbouring properties;\r\rOther non material planning considerations that are building regulations related include:\rStructural integrity of property and its foundations;\rParty wall matters including any encroachments or damage to boundary walls.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed single storey rear extension would match the depth of the existing extension at No.61 Clayton Road and is og an acceptable scale and design.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension is modest in scale and depth, with a roof form to match the host dwelling and also finished externally to match the host dwelling. Whilst no other first floor extensions are evident in the immediate vicinity of the site given the above no objection is raised to this part of the proposal.\r\rNo objection is raised to the proposed side porch which is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, roof form, siting and design.\r\rIt is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It has been demonstrated that the proposal would not unduly impact any neighbouring property at No.61 Clayton Road  in terms of loss of sunlight/daylight as a result of the proposed first floor extension. Given the scale and siting of the proposed extensions it is not considered there would be an unacceptable impact on the amenities of No.65 Clayton Road. \r\rFlood Risk\r\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: As set out above, the application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rA flood risk assessment has been submitted with the proposal stating the proposed floor levels will be set no lower than existing, and other flood mitigation measures to be undertaken in line with the EA standing advice. As such, officers are satisfied the proposal would not have an adverse impact on flooding.\r\rFire safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy to demonstrate the provision of a suitable evacuation assembly point and fire safety measures within the building to comply with the London Plan. However, officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contrary to National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\r",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on The Manor Drive.

This proposal has removed the front overhang.\r\rConsultations\rEight neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and \r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comments:The proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are Nos. 57 & 61  Manor Drive North.   The proposed rear extension would be small in scale, given the size and orientation of the site it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties.   \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to the closest habitable windows of neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions.

As such, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the removal of the chimney stack would unbalance the roof profiles of the pair of semi-detached properties, officers note that the chimney stack is positioned to the rear of the existing roofslope and as such has limited visibility from the streetscene.
