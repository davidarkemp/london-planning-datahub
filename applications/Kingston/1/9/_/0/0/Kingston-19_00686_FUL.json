    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021;\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012; \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012; and,\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a two storey side extension, single storey rear extension, and roof extensions, together with alterations to the fenestration and internal layout.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rLead Local Flood Authority - Requests further information relating to surface water drainage.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- Flood risk and drainage.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed side extension would conflict with the guidance in the Council's Residential Design SPD, insofar as it would appear as a fully integrated extension. However, the adjoining semi-detached property, No. 42 Cambridge Avenue, already benefits from a fully integrated two storey side extension (see application reference 15/14579/HOU) and the proposed development would therefore restore a sense of balance to the pair. A sufficient gap (of approximately 1m) would be maintained between the side extension and the boundary of the site, and the characteristic two storey projection to the front elevation would be preserved. \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would be of an unusual but high quality design, with appropriate detailing and finishes. \r\rThe proposed roof extensions and alterations would amount to fairly typical domestic development. The box form of the dormer would not match the existing pitched main roof but officers recognise that it would sit comfortably alongside the existing box dormer at the adjoining semi-detached property (see application reference 15/14287/LDP).\r\rIn any event, the proposed works to the rear of the property would not be readily visible from any public vantage points and would therefore have a limited impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe alterations to the fenestration throughout the building would integrate well with the existing, being in a crittal style.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have a positive impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the scale and siting of the proposed extensions is such that they would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light. The proposed side facing roof lights may give rise to unacceptable views over No. 46 Cambridge Avenue, but this could be effectively mitigated by a condition requiring obscure glazing. The remaining windows would offer similar views to those already available from the property.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rThe site is located partly within Flood Zone 2. The applicant has submitted a site-specific flood risk assessment which sets out that floor levels within the extensions will be set no lower than existing in order to mitigate the risk of flooding to occupiers of the development. Officers consider this to be an appropriate measure but also recommend a condition requiring electrical sockets to be located at least 750mm above finished floor level.\r\rNotwithstanding the above, the applicant has not submitted any information regarding surface water management. Policy DM4 of the Core Strategy requires all proposals to include SuDS unless it can be demonstrated that this would not be feasible. The applicant has not demonstrated that inclusion of SuDS would not be feasible. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DM4.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have a positive impact on the character and appearance of the area, principally by restoring balance to the pair of semi-detached properties of which the application property forms part. This is a benefit that carries significant weight in favour of the proposal.\r\rThe proposal is however contrary to policy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy, which requires development proposals to include SuDS unless it can be demonstrated that this would not be feasible. However, officers consider that the scale of the proposed development would be such that it would not materially increase the risk of flooding, either to the site itself or elsewhere, as a result of surface water. Officers are also satisfied, subject to conditions, that the proposed development would not increase the risk of flooding from rivers. In light of these considerations, officers attach limited weight to the harm arising from the conflict with policy DM4.\r\rOfficers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable. This is a neutral matter.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",

    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service.

No representations were received.\r\rLead Local Flood Authority - Objection on the grounds of insufficient information relating to surface water drainage.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and\r- Flood risk and drainage.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed side extension would be large in scale and would not appear as a subordinate or proportionate addition to the dwelling. The ridge of its roof would not be set down at all from the ridge of the main roof and its front wall would not be set back from the main front wall of the dwelling at first floor level. It would therefore appear as a fully integrated extension and, given that it would significantly exceed half of the width of the existing dwelling (even before the return facing Raeburn Avenue is taken into account), it would appear to dominate its host. Its irregular footprint would also be a highly unusual feature for the area and the entirely blank nature of the elevation facing Raeburn Avenue would further add to its incongruous appearance. \r\rIt is recognised that the existing extension to the adjoining semi-detached property, 1 Northcote Avenue, is also of a fully integrated design. However, permission for that extension was granted in 1989 and planning policy has changed significantly since. In particular, the Residential Design SPD 2013 sets out guidance for the design of two storey side extensions and the proposed development, for the reasons set out above, would conflict with much of that guidance.\r\rThe proposed outbuilding would have a more typical appearance and, unlike the proposed side extension, would not be especially prominent within any public views. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and detailed design of the proposed side extension, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Raeburn Avenue street scene, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed side extension would conform to the front and rear elevations of 91 Raeburn Avenue. Given this, together with the fact that this property does not have any windows in its northern flank elevation, officers are satisfied that the proposed side extension would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light. The proposed fenestration would offer similar views to the existing i.e. towards the front and rear of the dwelling. The proposed extension would not therefore result in any materially harmful loss of privacy.\r\rLikewise officers are satisfied that the scale of the proposed outbuilding would be such that it would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF. Policy DM4 also requires developments to incorporate sustainable drainage systems unless it can be demonstrated that this would not be feasible.\r\rThe application site lies partly within Flood Zone 2. The applicant has submitted a site-specific flood risk assessment but this does not consider sustainable drainage systems, nor does the application form provide any further information on this topic. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development, by reason of the scale, siting and detailed design of the proposed side extension, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Raeburn Avenue street scene, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe proposed development would not utilise a sustainable drainage system and the applicant has failed to demonstrate that this would not be feasible. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy DM4 of the Core Strategy 2012. However, given the scale of the proposed development, as well as the fact that the extensions and outbuildings would be located wholly within Flood Zone 1 (which is the area at the lowest risk of flooding), officers consider that it would not materially increase the risk of flooding to the site itself or elsewhere and that it would be unreasonable to resist the proposal on this basis. Officers therefore attach limited weight to the conflict with policy DM4.\r\rThe principal benefits associated with the proposed development would be derived from the improvement to the living conditions of the occupiers of the property through providing increased living space. This is a very limited, private benefit.\r\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable. This is a neutral matter.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
