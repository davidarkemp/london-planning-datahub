No representations received.\r\rOther Consultations\rRBK Pollution Control Team - Response received to suggest condition to upgrade the sound insulation, should planning permission be granted. This condition has been imposed to the grant of this retrospective planning permission for post conversion implementation. \r\rRBK Strategic Planning Team and Regeneration and Internationalism Team - Comments received in relation to policies regarding loss of employment space, loss of community facility and replacement residential use specifying policies DM17, DM24 and CS10. Extracts of the response are provided below: \r\rLoss of Employment: -\r\"It is considered that the loss of employment floorspace would not compromise the viability of the sites given the size of the floorspace being lost. However, the applicant has not submitted any marketing report to support the loss of employment floorspace, therefore the proposal fails to meet the requirements of the policy.\"\r\rLoss of Community Facility: - \r\"The applicant has not submitted any documents to support the loss of a community facility, therefore the proposal fails to meet the requirements of the policy.\"\r\rReplacement Residential Use: - \r\"The proposal would result in the gain of 1 x self-contained residential unit (C3 use). Core Strategy Policy CS10 states that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing. The policy goes on to state that new housing should be delivered in the most sustainable locations and that the preferred locations for new housing include the three District Centres (Surbiton, Tolworth, New Malden).\"\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Engineering - Response received to state the refuse/recycling and cycle storage would need to be implemented. A condition is attached to the grant of this retrospective planning permission to this effect. \r\rSite and Surroundings\r1. The application site is located on the western side of High Street, New Malden. The application property comprises of a three-storey red brick building with a retail unit occupying the ground floor. A language education centre occupies the second floor of the building. Council Tax records show that from 01/11/2016, the third floor has been in occupation as a self-contained two-bedroom residential flat. \r\r2. In terms of designations, the property as a whole lies within a Shopping Frontage and is within New Malden Town Centre.  It has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) of 4, representing a good level of public transport accessibility. \r\rProposal\r3.       The proposal is made retrospectively to change the use of the third (top) floor of the application site from a language education centre to a self-contained two-bedroom residential flat (Use Class C3). The internal configuration of the accommodation has been retained with no internal or external alterations undertaken to facilitate the change of use. \r\r4.       There is no on-site car parking provision associated with the residential flat. \r\rPlanning Considerations\r5.       The key planning considerations in this case are:\r\rThe principle of the development\rThe impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers\rThe impact of the development on the transport network  \r\rPrinciple of Development\r6.      The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development means that the planning system has three overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways:\r\rAn economic objective - to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure;\rA social objective - to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities' health, social and cultural wellbeing; and\rAn environmental objective - to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy.\r\r7.      Planning decisions should aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which, among other things, enable and support healthy lifestyles, especially where this would address identified local health and wellbeing needs. Local planning authorities should also take a positive approach to applications for alternative uses of land which is currently developed but not allocated for a specific purpose in plans, where this would help to meet identified development needs.\r\r8.      The Core Strategy states within Policy DM17 the Council's intention to protect all employment land and premises in Kingston Town Centre, Surbiton, New Malden and Tolworth District Centres, Local Centres and Industrial / Business areas to enhance their vitality and viability and promote employment growth. The policy goes onto set out three tests that proposals for non-employment or mixed use schemes need to satisfy. Only the first and second tests are relevant for the purposes of this application.The first test relating to the acceptability of alternative uses, requires the submission of a marketing report to assess the need for employment uses at this location.The second test requires that mixed use development schemes should not result in a net loss of employment capacity (floorspace and/or land), and should not compromise the viability of the site and/or its surroundings for employment purposes. \r\r9.      Policy DM24 states in a similar vein that the Council will resist the loss of community facilities unless (a) there is evidence to suggest that the facility is no longer needed, (b) it has been vacant and marketed for a community use without success, or (c) it can be re-provided elsewhere or in a different way.\r\r10.     It is noted that no such supporting marketing evidence has been submitted as part of the application to demonstrate that the language education centre would not need to occupy the same extent of accommodation as previously (i.e. two levels of floorspace). However, on balance, it is considered that given that the second floor is still given over to D1 floorspace serving the learning education centre, the employment floorspace and community facility will not be lost entirely and the loss of employment space which does result from the change of use would not compromise the viability of the site and/or its surroundings for employment purposes. This sentiment is shared by Council's Strategic Planning Team. \r\r11.    The proposal results in the addition of 1no. self-contained two-bedroom residential unit (Use Class C3). It is recognised that Core Strategy Policy CS10 states that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing and goes onto state that new housing should be delivered in the most sustainable locations and that the preferred locations for new housing include the three District Centres (Surbiton, Tolworth, New Malden). The NPPF recognises the Government's objective of significantly boosting the supply of homes and its policies strongly emphasise the need for local authorities to meet their objectively assessed needs for housing, which includes providing a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to meet five years' worth of required housing. This is something which the Council is currently unable to do.\r\r12.    It is considered that the loss of 78sqm of D1 floorspace over the third floor of this building would not compromise the viability/operation of the D1 floorspace to remain on the second floor and would not be harmful overall as the loss of floorspace is relatively minimal.  Although the proposal does not meet the requirements of Policies DM17 and DM24, material weight should be given to a relatively short period of time that the existing premises has been in B1/D1 use for (approximately 1 year according to Council Tax records) and the previous long-term residential use of the premises. On balance, it is considered that the creation of one self-contained two-bedroom dwelling would outweigh the harm caused by the loss of D1 floorspace. Therefore, the principle of the development is considered acceptable.\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Quality of Accommodation\r13.    The NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities. \r\r14.     Planning decisions should ensure that developments: will function well and add to the overall quality of the area; are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; are sympathetic to local character and history; and establish a strong sense of place.\r\r15.     Permission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, taking into account and local design standards or style guides in plans or supplementary planning documents. Conversely, where the design of a development accords with clear expectations in plan policies, design should not be used by the decision-maker as a valid reason to object to development. \r\r16.     At the regional level, the London Plan requires that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. It should improve an area's visual or physical connection with natural features. In areas of poor or ill-defined character, development should build on the positive elements that can contribute to establishing an enhanced character for the future function of the area. \r\r17.     Architecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape. It should incorporate the highest quality materials and design, appropriate to its context.\r\r18.    Accordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r\rRecognises distinctive local features and character\rHas regard to the historic and natural environment\rHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\rAccords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\rRelates well and connects to its surroundings\r\r19.     The most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following:\r\rPrevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\rPrevailing density of the surrounding area\rScale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\rLandscape setting and features\rPlot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\rBuilding line build-up, set-back and front boundary\rTypical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges etc.\r\r20.    The Council's Residential Design SPD provides further in-depth guidance. Policy Guidance 29 (Materials and Detailing) states that:\r\rDevelopers will be expected to demonstrate that they have considered the choice of materials and design detailing of those buildings that they consider represent the prevailing character of the streetscene or local area.\r\rA preference should be given to the use of prevailing materials and details used in the surrounding local area unless it can be demonstrated that the choice of materials or use of design features in a proposal for residential development would enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene.\r\rCare should be taken to ensure the replication of detailing or materials present in the streetscene of local area represents an authentic synthesis of local architectural styles that compliment those of the host building or surrounding area. Development proposals which include the use of materials or detailing which is out of context or is lacking in imagination or character will be discouraged.\r\r21.    The proposed development would result in the external appearance of the application property remaining unchanged and it is not considered that the change of use to a residential flat would, in itself, not materially alter the character of the area. On this basis, it is considered that the impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area would be acceptable.  \r\r22.    The residential flat comprises of two bedrooms and extends to an internal floorspace of 78sqm. The flat, therefore, exceeds minimum space standards for a two-bedroom, four-person flat as specified in the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards. The accommodation is laid out so as to be logical and would not result in overly contrived or cramped accommodation. All habitable rooms benefit from windows allowing for sufficient ingress of daylight/sunlight, appropriate ventilation and good outlook. One of the bedrooms gives direct access to a private rear roof terrace extending to approx 27sqm. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r23.    The NPPF states that planning decisions should ensure that developments create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and wellbeing, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\r24.     At the regional level, the London Plan requires that buildings and structures do not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of surrounding land and buildings, particularly residential buildings, in relation to privacy, overshadowing, wind and microclimate.\r\r25.    The Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should:\r\rEnsure adequate private and/or communal amenity space\rHave regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\r\r26.    The Residential Design SPD provides further guidance on this subject. Policy Guidance 32 (Daylighting and Sunlighting) and Policy Guidance 18 (Loss of Light to Existing Windows) state that new development will be assessed against the 45o and 25o rules, as set out in the British Research Establishment Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice, 2011.\r\r27.    Given that the proposed development would not result in any additional built form on the site or alter the elevations of the application property in any way, it is not considered that the development would result in any material harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers by way of overbearing appearance, loss of light or overlooking. It is acknowledged that the comings and goings from the former education centre at third floor level would be considerably higher than those generated from a single family dwellinghouse and for this reason it is considered that the development would likely result in a reduction of noise and disturbance to neighbouring occupiers. It is not considered that the residential use would materially conflict with those uses on the lower two floors. \r\r28.    Having regard to the above, it is considered that the impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rTransport\r29.    The NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\r30.    Development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\r31.    Applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\r32.     At the regional level, the London Plan requires that the impacts of proposed development on transport capacity and the transport network are fully assessed. Where existing transport capacity is insufficient to allow for the travel generated and no firm plans exist for an increase in capacity, development should either be phased until it is known that the requirements can be met, or otherwise refused. Where necessary, transport assessments and travel plans should be provided in line with TfL guidance. \r\r33.     The Mayor wishes to see an appropriate balance being struck between promoting new development and preventing excessive car parking provision that can undermine cycling, walking and public transport use. To this end, the London Plan sets out maximum car parking standards which are the basis for considering planning applications.\r\r34.     Accordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. New development should comply with the relevant car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\r35.    However, the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD makes clear that in some cases, the adopted regional (and/or local) parking standards may not be appropriate and development proposals should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. This is due to the Borough's outer London location, with large areas of low public transport accessibility, poor orbital public transport links, and poor access to parts of Surrey via public transport. In some cases, where adverse impacts on the local area, such as on-street parking issues or constraints to economic growth, can be clearly demonstrated, increased parking provision that exceeds the standards may be considered by the Council.\r\r36.    The application site has a PTAL of 4 (of a possible 6b) which is considered to represent good accessibility. The absence of on-site car parking is therefore considered to be acceptable. \r\r37.     Having regard to the above, it is considered that the development would have an acceptable impact on the transport network.\r\rConclusion\rOverall, it is considered that, on balance, the benefits of the development to create one residential flat of a generally good standard of accommodation would outweigh the relatively low harm resulting from the partial loss of employment floorspace and community facility floorspace. It is considered that given that the language education centre will still operate from the premises (i.e. on the second floor), that the partial loss of floorspace would not be materially harmful to the viability of the D1 use, nor impact upon the general viability or vitality of the locality. The development is considered to accord with Policy CS10\r\r\rAs there are no other material considerations which indicate otherwise, it is recommended that retrospective planning permission be granted for the development.\r",

Two responses were received, raising the following comments:\rScale and design;\rLoss of light and privacy; and\rLoss of family housing \r\rOther Consultations\rRBK Highways Officer: No objection.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site relates to a two-storey, semi-detached residential property situated on the northern side of Grafton Road. The site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not comprise of a listed building. \r\rProposal\r2.      The application seeks the conversion of the single family dwellinghouse to create 2no. residential units. The smaller of the two units - that is, a one-bedroom flat - would be arranged on the ground floor. The larger of the two proposed units - that is, a three-bedroom flat - would be arranged over three floors.\r\r3.       Two on-site car parking spaces are to be provided to the front of the property. \r\rPlanning Considerations\r4.       The key planning considerations in this case are:\r\rThe Principle of the Development\rStandard of Accommodation\r\rPrinciple of Development\r5.      The purpose of the planning system is to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development. Achieving sustainable development means that the planning system has three overarching objectives, which are interdependent and need to be pursued in mutually supportive ways:\r\rAn economic objective - to help build a strong, responsive and competitive economy, by ensuring that sufficient land of the right types is available in the right places and at the right time to support growth, innovation and improved productivity; and by identifying and coordinating the provision of infrastructure;\rA social objective - to support strong, vibrant and healthy communities, by ensuring that a sufficient number and range of homes can be provided to meet the needs of present and future generations; and by fostering a well-designed and safe built environment, with accessible services and open spaces that reflect current and future needs and support communities' health, social and cultural wellbeing; and\rAn environmental objective - to contribute to protecting and enhancing our natural, built and historic environment; including making effective use of land, helping to improve biodiversity, using natural resources prudently, minimising waste and pollution, and mitigating and adapting to climate change, including moving to a low carbon economy.\r\r6.      Planning decisions should aim to achieve healthy, inclusive and safe places which, among other things, enable and support healthy lifestyles, especially where this would address identified local health and wellbeing needs. Local planning authorities should also take a positive approach to applications for alternative uses of land which is currently developed but not allocated for a specific purpose in plans, where this would help to meet identified development needs.\r\r7.      The Core Strategy states within Policy DM13, the Council's intention to ensure that the housing delivered is of high-quality and the most appropriate type. \r\r8.      The proposal results in the creation of 2no. self-contained residential units (Use Class C3). It is recognised that Core Strategy Policy CS10 states that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing and goes onto state that new housing should be delivered in the most sustainable locations and that the preferred locations for new housing include the three District Centres (Surbiton, Tolworth, New Malden). The NPPF recognises the Government's objective of significantly boosting the supply of homes and its policies strongly emphasise the need for local authorities to meet their objectively assessed needs for housing, which includes providing a supply of specific deliverable sites sufficient to meet five years' worth of required housing. This is something which the Council is currently unable to do.\r\r9.    It is recognised that the application site is subject to extensive planning history. The previously submitted planning application (reference: 17/15122/FUL) for the erection of a two-storey side and single-storey rear extension, erection of a rear dormer and hip to gable roof extensions to facilitate loft conversion and to form 2no. dwelling units. This application was refused for three reasons: (1) the scale and design of the hip-to-gable roof extension which was considered to be uncharacteristic; (2) the proposal would fail to provide a satisfactory mix of residential units and would not provide 30% of three or more bedroom units; and (3) the development would provide inadequate floorspace for the first/second floor flat, poor outlook for the bedroom in the ground floor and a poor relationship between the ground floor bedroom and parking layout, the proposal would result in a substandard form of accommodation, adversely affecting the amenities of the future occupiers of the development. \r\r10.    The proposal put forward is considered to address/successfully overcome the above three reasons for refusal cited in the previous application. Reason 1 for refusal no longer applies as the hip-to-gable and dormer roof extensions have since been carried out under Certificate of Lawfulness (reference: 17/14173/LDP). The side and rear extensions have been constructed in accordance with planning permission reference: 17/14650/HOU. Reason  2 for refusal has been addressed through amended scheme which proposes a triplex 3-bedroom unit exceeding 84sqm with amenity area and a 1-bedroom unit exceeding 50sqm. Reason 3 for refusal has been overcome via design revisions. Those windows facing the side walkway are all secondary in nature and each habitable room has views to the front or rear.\r\r11.    On balance, it is considered that the principle of the development is acceptable.\r\r\rCharacter, Appearance and Quality of Accommodation\r12.    The NPPF states that the creation of high quality buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve. Good design is a key aspect of sustainable development, creates better places in which to live and work and helps to make development acceptable to communities. \r\r13.    Planning decisions should ensure that developments: will function well and add to the overall quality of the area; are visually attractive as a result of good architecture, layout and appropriate and effective landscaping; are sympathetic to local character and history; and establish a strong sense of place. \r\r14.     Permission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area and the way it functions, taking into account and local design standards or style guides in plans or supplementary planning documents. Conversely, where the design of a development accords with clear expectations in plan policies, design should not be used by the decision-maker as a valid reason to object to development. \r\r15.     At the regional level, the London Plan requires that development have regard to the form, function and structure of an area, place or street, as well as the scale, mass and orientation of surrounding buildings. It should improve an area's visual or physical connection with natural features. In areas of poor or ill-defined character, development should build on the positive elements that can contribute to establishing an enhanced character for the future function of the area. \r\r16.     Architecture should make a positive contribution to a coherent public realm, streetscape and wider cityscape. It should incorporate the highest quality materials and design, appropriate to its context.\r\r17.    Accordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r\rRecognises distinctive local features and character\rHas regard to the historic and natural environment\rHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\rAccords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\rRelates well and connects to its surroundings\r\r18.     The most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following:\r\rPrevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\rPrevailing density of the surrounding area\rScale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\rLandscape setting and features\rPlot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\rBuilding line build-up, set-back and front boundary\rTypical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges etc.\r\r19.    The Council's Residential Design SPD provides further in-depth guidance. Policy Guidance 29 (Materials and Detailing) states that:\r\rDevelopers will be expected to demonstrate that they have considered the choice of materials and design detailing of those buildings that they consider represent the prevailing character of the streetscene or local area.\rA preference should be given to the use of prevailing materials and details used in the surrounding local area unless it can be demonstrated that the choice of materials or use of design features in a proposal for residential development would enhance the character and appearance of the streetscene.\rCare should be taken to ensure the replication of detailing or materials present in the streetscene of local area represents an authentic synthesis of local architectural styles that compliment those of the host building or surrounding area. Development proposals which include the use of materials or detailing which is out of context or is lacking in imagination or character will be discouraged.\r\r20.    The proposed development would result in the external appearance of the application property remaining unchanged and it is not considered that the change of use of the single family dwellinghouse to two residential flats would, in itself, not materially alter the character of the area. On this basis, it is considered that the impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area would be acceptable.  \r\r21.    The 1-bedroom flat arranged over one storey measures to approx 51sqm and would, therefore, exceed the minimum space standards for a one-bedroom, two-person flat (i.e. 50sqm), as specified in the Technical Housing Standards Nationally Described Space Standards. The 3-bedroom flat arranged over three storeys measures to approx 88sqm. This would fall slightly below the space standards which specifies that a three-bedroom, four-person flat arranged over three levels is 90sqm. On balance, it is considered that the accommodation would not result in overly contrived or cramped accommodation. All habitable rooms benefit from windows allowing for sufficient ingress of daylight/sunlight, appropriate ventilation and good outlook. \r\r22.    The flats are provided with private amenity spaces to the rear of 35sqm and 29sqm. The provision of dedicated external amenity space is considered acceptable. \r\r23.    The previous application proposed a bedroom and en-suite to the front of the dwelling at ground floor level. One of the concerns relating to the internal arrangement of the accommodation centred on the lack of defensible space between the off-road car parking spaces and the bedroom window. The internal accommodation proposed in this revised application shows a living room and cloakroom to the front of the property at ground floor level. Whilst it is acknowledged that this is not a desirable outlook for a habitable room to look out onto parking, it is recognised that this is the existing arrangement for the dwelling and is the generally prevailing character of the street. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\r24.    The NPPF states that planning decisions should ensure that developments create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and wellbeing, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\r25.     At the regional level, the London Plan requires that buildings and structures do not cause unacceptable harm to the amenity of surrounding land and buildings, particularly residential buildings, in relation to privacy, overshadowing, wind and microclimate.\r\r26.    The Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should:\r\rEnsure adequate private and/or communal amenity space\rHave regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\r\r27.    The Residential Design SPD provides further guidance on this subject. Policy Guidance 32 (Daylighting and Sunlighting) and Policy Guidance 18 (Loss of Light to Existing Windows) state that new development will be assessed against the 45o and 25o rules, as set out in the British Research Establishment Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice, 2011.\r\r28.    Given that the proposed development would not result in any additional built form on the site or alter the elevations of the application property in any way, it is not considered that the development would result in any material harm to the amenities of neighbouring occupiers by way of overbearing appearance, loss of light or overlooking.\r\r29.    Having regard to the above, it is considered that the impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rMix of Residential Units\r30.    Policy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to ensure that a broad mix of accommodation options are available to residents and that a range of local housing needs are met. Policy DM13 further seeks to ensure that development proposals incorporate a mix of unit sizes and types and provide a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3 or more bedroom units, unless it can be robustly demonstrated that this would be unsuitable or unviable. Given that the site is located in a residential street, adjacent to existing family houses, it is evident that the site is suitable for family housing. \r\r31. The proposal provides for two residential units - 1no. one-bedroom flat and 1no. three-bedroom flat. The proposals therefore accord with providing a satisfactory mix of residential units in line with Policies CS10 and DM13 of the LDF Core Strategy. \r\rHighways and Parking\r32.    Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016) sets out the maximum car parking standards for new residential development, requiring the development to provide a maximum of 2no. car parking space for each of the proposed dwellings. It also states that developments within areas of good public transport accessibility should aim for significantly less than 1 space per unit. \r\r33.    Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. \r\r34.    This area has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 3 (moderate). The London Plan gives a maximum parking standard of less than 1no. Space per unit for 1 and 2 bedroomed units. \r\r35.    The proposal would provide a total of 2no. off-street car parking spaces to the front of the property and 2no. cycle parking spaces. \r\r36.    This is in accordance with London Plan requirements. As such, the proposal is considered to be acceptable in transport and highway safety terms and would be compliant with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012). \r\r         Community Infrastructure Levy \r37.    In accordance with the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) regulations (as amended) this development is liable to pay both Mayoral and Kingston CIL. \r\r38.    The Mayor of London's CIL is £60 per sqm of development in Kingston upon Thames and the site is located in Zone 3 of the Kingston CIL Charging Zone 3, which is calculated as £85 per sqm. \r\r39.    We collect the charge from all developments that are liable for MCIL on or after 1 April 2012 and for KCIL for developments approved on or after 1st November 2015. \r\rConclusion\r40.    Overall, it is considered that, on balance, the benefits of the development to create one residential flat of a generally good standard of accommodation would outweigh the relatively low harm resulting from the partial loss of employment floorspace and community facility floorspace. It is considered that given that the language education centre will still operate from the premises (i.e. on the second floor), that the partial loss of floorspace would not be materially harmful to the viability of the D1 use, nor impact upon the general viability or vitality of the locality. The development is considered to accord with Policy CS10. \r\r41.     As there are no other material considerations which indicate otherwise, it is recommended that planning permission be granted for the development.\r",

The site comprises of an area of hardstanding which is currently utilised as the side garden for No. 24. \r\rImmediately adjacent to the north of the application site lies No.24 Long Walk, a two-storey dwelling which had once formed part of a pair of semi-detached dwellinghouses, but has since effectively become an end of terrace property by virtue of the construction of an attached dwelling to the northern side of No. 23 (at the junction with Muybridge Road). \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance, consisting of primarily two-storey semi-detached and terraced housing. \r\rThe site is not located within a Conservation Area and does not contain a Listed Building or lie within proximity to any Listed Buildings. The site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 1b (poor). The site falls  within Kingston CIL Zone 3.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the construction of a detached two-storey, three-bedroom dwellinghouse, with associated car parking provision proposed to the front of the dwelling for 2no. vehicles.  \r\rThe proposed dwelling would be set back from the existing front building line created by No.s 24/23/23A Long Walk and project slightly further than the existing building line to the rear. \r\rAssessment\rThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) has an underlying presumption in favour of sustainable development which is carried through to the local Development Plan. More specifically, paragraph 11 of the NPPF states development proposals which accord with an up-to-date development plan should be approved without delay. \r\rParagraph 118 of the NPPF directs that planning policies and decisions should \"promote and support the development of under-utilised land and buildings, especially if this would help to meet identified needs for housing where land supply is constrained and available sites could be used more effectively''. Paragraph 123 stipulates that \"Where there is an existing or anticipated shortage of land for meeting identified housing needs, it is especially important that planning policies and decisions avoid homes being built at low densities, and ensure that developments make optimal use of the potential of each site.\r\rAt a regional level, Policies 3.3 and 3.4 of the London Plan emphasises that the Mayor recognises the pressing need for more homes in London and will work with relevant partners to ensure that housing need is met. This is supported by the LDF Policy CS 10 of the Core Strategy which sets out the Borough's housing targets, as defined by the London Plan. \r\rPolicy CS8 of the LDF Core Strategy states that the Council will protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development and will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where the character has been eroded or needs improving. Policy CS10 further advises that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing, and will seek to ensure that a broad mix of accommodation options are available to residents and that a range of local housing needs are met. \r\rIt should be noted that currently the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. As such, paragraph 11 of the NPPF stipulates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rThe Development Plan sets out that high quality development will be expected, which respects, takes advantage of, and enhances the positive elements and distinctive features of the borough. The main issues to consider when making an assessment of the application are the impacts of the proposals upon the character and appearance of the site and surrounding area.\rThe main issues for consideration in relation to this application are as follows:\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) has an underlying presumption in favour of sustainable development which is carried through to the Local Development Plan. More specifically, paragraph 11 of the NPPF states development proposals which accord with an up-to-date development plan should be approved without delay. \r\rParagraph 18 of the NPPF directs that planning policies and decisions should \"promote and support the development of under-utilised land and buildings, especially if this would help to meet identified needs for housing where land supply is constrained and available sites could be used more effectively\". \r\rAnnexe 2 of the NPPF clearly states that land in built-up areas such as residential gardens is excluded from the definition of 'previously developed land'. \r\rAt a regional level, Policies 3.3 and 3.4 of the London Plan emphasises that the Mayor recognises the pressing need for more homes in London and will work with relevant partners to ensure that housing need is met. This is supported by the LDF Policy CS 10 of the Core Strategy which sets out the Borough's housing targets, as defined by the London Plan. \r\rIt should be noted that currently the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. As such, paragraph 11 of the NPPF stipulates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rWhilst it is recognised that the Council does not have an up-to-date supply of housing sites, the benefits of the proposed development would need to be weighed against any significant adverse impact, as  required by paragraph 11 of the NPPF. Please refer to the final section \r\rIt is acknowledged that the application site is not 'previously developed land', as defined within Annex 2 (Glossary) of the NPPF. Nevertheless, for the purposes of the planning assessment it is considered that the application site does not fall within Annexe 2 of the NPPF's definition of 'previously developed land'. The site is, therefore, classified as being 'greenfield land'. Overall, the scale of the development proposed is considered to be appropriate for such a site, generally commensurate in built form with the scale of the existing built form on the site. \r\rSustainable development underpins planning policy from a local to national level, which includes the provision of additional housing stock and encourage development proposals to achieve the maximum intensity of use compatible with local setting. It is in this context that the proposed development would support these policy objectives and is found to be acceptable.\r\rThe application proposes the erection of a detached two-storey dwelling and associated hard and soft landscaping. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance and, as such, the policies of the current development plan would not preclude such type of developments. Therefore, the principle is acceptable, subject to the below considerations relating to design and amenity. \r\rCharacter and Appearance\rThe National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) attaches great importance to the design of the built environment. Paragraph 130 states that permission should be refused for development of poor design that fails to take the opportunities available for improving the character and quality of an area. Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rPolicy CS10 of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted 2012) states that the Council will take full advantage of opportunities to deliver new housing, and seeks to ensure that a broad mix of accommodation options are available to residents and that a range of local housing needs are met. However, further to this Policy CS10 states that in principle, the Council has not identified a need to develop new housing on residential garden land.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy further advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rPolicy CS8 states that the Council will protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, existing buildings, and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development and will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where the character has been eroded or needs improving. It will use the Borough Character Study and Residential Design SPD to require good design and guide the assessment of development proposals, and will seek to ensure that new development:\rRecognises distinctive local features and character;\rHas regard to the historic and natural environment;\rHelps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality;\rRelates well and connects to its surroundings\r\rPolicy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Development) states that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements are identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or an area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced, and include the following:\rPrevailing development typology, including house type, sizes, and occupancy;\rPrevailing density of the surrounding area;\rScale, layout, height, form, massing;\rPlot width and format which includes spaces between buildings;\rBuilding line build up, set back, and front boundary; and \rTypical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and the design detailing of elevations.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD (2013) states that in general, the prevailing development typology should be respected and where possible maintained unless a departure from this can be justified e.g. where the established character is weakly defined and requires enhancement to reinforce local identity.\r\rThe prevailing character of Long Walk is one of two-storey semi-detached and terraced dwellings with a largely consistent line of semi-detached dwellings in facing brick along the western side of Long Walk and terraced properties finished in white render to the eastern length of Long Walk. \r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment. \r\r It is noted that there are varying separation distances between existing dwellings in the vicinity of the application site. The proposed dwelling is designed to replicate the scale and massing of the existing dwellings. As such, it is considered that the introduction of a detached dwelling in this location would not be harmful to the character of the area and would, therefore, be acceptable.\r\rThe proposed appearance of the dwellinghouse has taken design cues from the existing properties along Long Walk which is largely in-keeping with the surrounding build form. In addition, the proposed dwellinghouse would maintain the existing front building line created by No.s 24/23/23A Long Walk.\r\rThe dwelling has been designed to correspond with the prevailing height, scale and massing of the existing dwellings within the vicinity and is considered to reflect the surrounding architectural style (mirroring fenestration and materials of neighbouring dwellings). \r\rIn terms of the existing value of the application site, it is considered that the application site does not positively contribute to the streetscene. No. 24 is unique in the streetscape of Long Walk in that it is the only dwelling with an area of side garden. Infilling this gap with the proposed dwelling is not considered to erode the character and appearance of the streetscene.\r\rThe proposed ridge height responds to the pattern established by neighbouring properties, and the proposed eaves level (to a height of approx 5.1m corresponds with neighbouring built form. The width and depth of the property would extend to approx 8m. A separation gap of approx 1m would be maintained between the property and No. 25 and a distance of approx 0.6m given between the property and No. 24, with a side passageway proposed for the residents of the proposed dwelling giving access to the rear garden. It is considered that the proposed new dwelling would fit comfortably within its plot and would respect the existing properties within the streetscene of Long Walk. \r\rThe applicant has stated the external materials to be used are to be finished in materials to match with neighbouring dwellinghouses along Long Walk. The materials include the following:\r\rRoof - red plain clay tiles\rExternal Wall - Light grey brick\r\rThe proposed materials and finishes are considered acceptable in principle and would complement the character and appearance of the surrounding area. It is recommended that specific details of external materials (to include external walls, roofing and fenestrations) be secured by way of a planning condition.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would be of a design and massing which is generally reflective of its context, proportionate to the plot size and its surroundings. It is considered that the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. As a result, the proposed development would generally be in accordance with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r\rResidential Amenity\rPolicy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe main consideration will be the residential amenity of the adjoining properties on Long Walk (i.e. No. 24 to the north and No. 25 to the south), as well as those dwellings to the rear of the application site which front onto Muybridge Road. \r\rIt is noted that the proposed dwelling would not comprise of any side-facing windows to either ground or first floor levels. Notwithstanding, there are no fenestrations to the side flank elevations of either No. 24 or No. 25. \r\rThe proposed dwelling would project further in its depth to the rear of the site than the terrace of properties adjacent to the north (i.e. No.s 24/23/23A). The rear building line would not impact upon No. 25 adjacent to the south as the existing side extension to No. 25 would project further in depth, effectively obscuring the built development from the line of sight from windows to the rear of No. 25. Therefore, the proposed development is not considered to create any loss of light, outlook or impact upon the privacy, light and amenity to either neighbouring properties. \r\rThose properties with the potential to be affected by the proposals to the rear of the application site are No.s 30 - 36 Muybridge Road. There would be a separation distance of approx 15m from the rear building line of the proposed dwelling and the rear elevations of those dwellings fronting Muybridge Road. It is acknowledged that there would be the opportunity for overlooking to the rear garden spaces of this row of terraces resulting from the construction of a two-storey dwelling (particularly from the upper floor rear-facing windows). Given the street configuration and pattern of development, there already exists mutual overlooking of the rear amenity spaces of properties. It is considered that the proposed dwelling would not result in a harmful degree of overlooking or loss of privacy to an extent which would materially differ from that which currently arises from neighbouring residential properties. \r\rStandard of Accommodation for Future Occupiers\rPolicy 3.5 of the London Plan (March 2016) adopts the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015). It sets clear internal minimum space standards for new dwellings to ensure that all new homes are fit for purpose.\r\rAll double bedrooms proposed have a floor space of at least 11.5sqm. As such, the proposed new dwelling is considered a 3-bed, 6-person, 2-storey dwelling. The minimum floorspace standards given for such a sized dwelling are 84sqm. \r\rThe proposed replacement dwelling would comply with the Technical Housing Standards - Nationally Described Space Standard (2015), exceeding the minimum space standards (at approx 85sqm + 25 sqm loft space), therefore providing an acceptable standard of accommodation. \r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013) states that a minimum of 50sqm should be provided for new houses (including conversions). The private amenity space would easily exceed these minimum requirements. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rTransport and Highways \rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy 6.13 of the London Plan, Table 6.2 requires up to 2 car parking spaces for such a site with a PTAL rating of 1b. The site is not located within a CPZ. The proposal includes two parking spaces to the front of the site within the front forecourt, therefore complying with Policy 6.13, Table 6.2 of the London Plan (2016). Highways have not submitted any objections to the proposals for off-street car parking, subject to a vehicular crossover and reinstatement of the pavement.\r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level of 1b (poor) and is not well served by public transport. A cycle store for 2no. cycles will need to be provided as The London Plan (2016), Table 6.3 requires 2no. cycle spaces per 3 or more bed dwellinghouse. The location of the cycle parking is situated within the rear garden space for the new dwelling, with side access provided and behind a proposed side gate which mitigates impacts without undermining the visual amenity of the street.  Notwithstanding this, it is considered that further details should be submitted to ensure satisfactory cycle storage facilities that would comply with Table 4 of the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD (2013), which requires the cycle parking to be secure. This aspect could be secured via a condition. \r\rAs such, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with Policy 6.13 of the London Plan and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy.\r\rRefuse/Recycling Facilities\rThe applicant has demonstrated the location of the refuse and recycling to the front forecourt area of the proposed dwelling, towards the boundary with No. 24. This is considered to be acceptable. \r\rRenewable Energy and Sustainability\rThe scheme would need to demonstrate compliance with the Mayor's Sustainability Strategy for reducing carbon emissions and the buildings energy demand through the use of sustainable design strategies. The residential development proposed would be expected to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4 in relation to energy and water, in accordance with the requirements of Policy 5.2 of the London Plan and Policy DM1 of the LDF Core Strategy. This could be secured by way of a planning condition in the event of an approval. \r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would be liable to pay the Mayoral Community Infrastructure Levy, which would be £60 per square metre. \rThe Kingston CIL liability would be £85 per square metre of development, as per Charging Zone 3, in this location. \r\rConclusion \rThe proposal is considered to comply with the above considerations and is, therefore, recommended for approval, subject to the below conditions.\r\r\r\r",

The wider setting of the application site is informed by Plough Green which lies opposite the application site, together with the village pond.\r\rThe application site is located within the Old Malden Conservation Area (Sub Area B). The site is also covered by a group Tree Preservation Order (TPO). \r\rThe Historic England Listing description is set out below:\r\r\"C15 and later. 2 storeys. Double pitched, tiled roof. 2 chimneys, one large chimney. 3 windows, casements, with bars. Modern entrance door, with pedimented hood on shaped brackets. 2 bay windows ground floor, one modern, one C18. The original C15 work is in the centre, showing external timber framing in 1st floor room. Modern addition on right. Front stucco. Weatherboarded gable end.\"\r\rList Entry Number: 1080094.\r\r\r3.\tPROPOSAL \rErection of a jumbrella, statue of a bull and fence lighting, internal alterations including alterations to the entrance lobby, raised floors, joinery and removal of modern partitions and decorative features. \r\r\r4.\tASSESSMENT \rImpact upon Listed Building\r\rSection 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 states that 'In considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority or, as the case may be, the Secretary of State shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.'\r\rNPPF provisions:\r\rIt is one of the core principles of the NPPF that heritage assets should be conserved in a manner appropriate to their significance. Chapter 12 of the National Planning Policy Framework at para 129 sets out that the local planning authority should identify and assess the particular significance of any heritage asset... They should take this assessment into account when considering the impact of a proposal on a heritage asset, to avoid or minimise conflict between the heritage asset's conservation and any aspect of the proposal.\r\rParas 131-135 sets out the framework for decision making in planning applications relating to heritage assets and this application takes into account the relevant considerations in these paragraphs.\r\rThis application proposes works affecting a Grade II listed building. \r\rThe proposals involve the erection of a single 'Jumbrella' structure with heating and lighting to the north-west of the public house in the front patio area. The Jumbrella would measure approx 4m in diameter and measure to a height of approx 2.4m to the base of the canopy. It is not considered that the Jumbrella structure would detract from the setting of the Grade-II listed public house - the proposed siting of the Jumbrella parasol would be between the two existing bay windows at ground floor and so would not obstruct visibility of these original fenestrations. \r\rA statue of a Bull is also proposed as part of this planning application. The statue would be sited to the north-east at the front of the public house. The statue would be affixed to a concrete slab plinth and measure to a height of approx 1.5m. Four recessed mount spotlights angled towards the Bull on each corner of the plinth are proposed. The statue is considered to be of an appropriate scale and siting to not represent a harmful addition to the site or negatively impact upon the setting of the Grade-II listed public house.\r\rInternally, the proposed works involve the reduction of the bar area to create additional seating with timber balustrading to enclose the seating area, removal of the existing fixed seating and the installation of replacement furniture layout to the 'Dick Turpin' bar area and relocation of screens. These proposals have been assessed by the Council and granted Listed Building Consent under reference: 15/15211/LBC.\r\rThe majority of the proposed works are not of permanence - fittings, rather than fixtures to the historic fabric of the building. The proposals seek very little removal of fixtures to the listed building. Where alterations are proposed to the existing listed fabric, these are reversible alterations and ensure that there is the potential at a future date for the building to be returned to its current state. \r\rOn balance, considering the submitted plans and supporting Design and Access Statement, the proposed works are deemed to be appropriate representing minimal harmful impact upon the historic fabric of value to the building, with the works easily reversible. \r\rThe proposal would be acceptable and would preserve the character and appearance of the Grade II Listed Building, having due regard to Section 16 of the Planning (Listed Building and Conservation Area) Act 1990 permission should be granted. Furthermore, it is concluded that the proposal would not harm the heritage asset as per the requirements of the NPPF (2019). \r",
