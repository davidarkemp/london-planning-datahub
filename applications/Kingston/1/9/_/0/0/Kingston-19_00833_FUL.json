    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r3 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - no objection to proposed development Recommended planning conditions.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for refurbishment works including fenestration alterations and cladding to the front and rear elevations. New roofing to main house incorporating insulation. Installation of solar panels and enlargement of rooflight in top flat roof. Erection of single storey rear garden studio with green roof. Installation of heat pump  to front garden\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a mid  terrace dwelling within a modernist 1960s terrace block. \r\rThe application site  resides within Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on heritage assets\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe existing dwelling is a  two storey building residing within a modernist style terrace block with a flat roof.\r\rRefurbishment works are proposed to both the front and rear elevations as well as the roof. In terms of the front elevation,  the existing UPVC windows are to be replaced with composite clad timber windows and a new timber front door with a glazed side panel would replace the existing . The existing painted timber cladding, clay hung tiles and buff/ grey brickwork would remain. \r\rIn terms of the rear elevation,  the existing UPVC sliding  doors at ground floor level are to be replaced by aluminium framed sliding door. At first floor level, the  existing UPVC windows would  be replaced by aluminium  framed sliding window.   The existing painted timber cladding to be replaced by oiled timber cladding. External folding timber shutters for the windows are to be introduced at first floor level  together with an external timber frame.\r\rThe existing flat roofing felt of the dwelling is to be replaced with  warm roof insulation flat roofing membrane (grey coloured).The existing  3nos rooflights  are to be removed and 3nos circular rooflights to be introduced.   \r\rThe proposal also includes  the provision of  PV solar panels to be positioned  on the flat roof.  Officers note the submitted proposed roof plan is an indicative drawing and no definitive details have been provided in respect of dimensions and model of the PV Solar Panels and consequently the number of panels to be accommodated on the roof. Further details would need to be provided by way of a  discharge of a  planning condition for review and approval by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rThe proposal also includes the provision of a garden room to be positioned at the end of the rear garden. It would measure depth of 3.2m and width of 5.9m with a flat roof eaves height of 2.5m.  The garden room would be constructed from vertical oiled timber cladding. The front elevation would present an external door and a single fixed glazed window. The rear elevation would also provide rear access.   A native wildflower green roof is proposed. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site  and the capacity of the rear garden, it is considered that the proposal for a garden room would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwelling and would be acceptable from a character and design perspective. \r\rA heat pump  is also proposed which would be positioned in the corner of the front garden  behind the existing front boundary wall.   \r  \rOverall the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the areas as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rThe standalone air source heat pump  is to be positioned in the  front garden  behind the existing front boundary wall. To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties, RBK Pollution Control have recommended  the inclusion of  a planning condition  to control the rating level of the noise determined by the plant.\r\rGiven the scope of the overall proposed development and the  proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rImpact on heritage assets\rParagraphs 195 to 208 of the NPPF (December 2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rParagraph 209 of the NPPF (December 2023)  states the effect of an application on the significance of a non designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the  application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss of the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer comment:  The application site falls within Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a designated non heritage asset.  Within the context of the existing built form and noting the  assessment above,  it is considered that the proposal would not have any adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not harm the significance of the Kingston Hill/ Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character . \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

Granted 1/3/2023\r\rAssessment\rOfficers note that the details provided have not clearly identified the proposed nature of the changes, or  referenced the completed works against the relevant matters which were subject of  condition discharge\r\rThe submitted layout plans indicate  significant  increases in hard landscaping  in comparison to the original planning permission, and significant reduction in replacement planting. These  works have been completed, and are also in  contravention of details approved under 19/02840/CLC  relating to condition 17 (In accordance with the approved AMS) and 18 (In accordance with the approved hard and soft landscape details) . The Tree Officer advises that as a result harm has been caused to TPO trees which the Council are now investigating \r\rDisabled parking:  Whilst the details  of  disabled parking provision across the site are not referenced or justified in any detail, it would appear to indicate that  the car park located adjacent to the site access  contains twelve standard bays and two disabled parking bays, with  an additional five disabled parking bays on site, including one outside Block C, two outside Block F, and two adjacent from Block Y.\rOfficers note that the  consented scheme included provision for  20 car parking spaces in total, of which 11 were disabled parking bays, as shown on the approved revised site plan.  The site layout as built has significantly reduced the level  of blue badge parking provision assessed against the approved scheme, and seeks to remove blue badge allocation/identification from  some of the remaining spaces provided\r\rCycle parking: A total of 186 long-stay cycle parking spaces were shown to  be provided in areas close to the residential buildings, and a further 24 covered short-stay spaces in line with adopted London Plan standards. Condition  26 of the decision notice states:\rWithin six months of the commencement of development details of secure cycle parking facilities (including specification of racks and detailed layout) for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development hereby approved have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. These facilities shall be fully implemented and made available for use prior to the occupation of the development hereby permitted and shall thereafter be retained for use at\rall times.\rDetails of the cycle provision were approved as part of condition discharge  21/00688/CLC and included provision for 186 long stay, covered and secured. 28 short stay covered and 28 short stay uncovered - Total  242. \rChanges are sought to the cycle   provision, although the level of cycle  provision  and detail is unclear. However, officers note that  a  recently submitted Delivery and Service Plan dated 21/01/2024 submitted as part of condition discharge 24/00073/CLC (Delivery and Service Plan) notes a total of 186 long-stay cycle parking spaces will be provided in areas close to the residential buildings. Long-stay cycle parking will be available for use by staff and students, in seven secure covered shelters located across the Site. The Site will feature nine spaces which are suitable for adapted cycles, tricycles and cargo bikes in line with the London Plan standards and these spaces will be spread over the long and short stay cycle parking areas around the Site.  24 covered short-stay cycle parking spaces in the form of Sheffield stands. There would appear to be a reduction of short stay cycle parking spaces of 32 spaces.\r\rThe as built landscaping also introduces changes in levels, and changes to landscape materials, including the use of tarmac and not aggregate chippings.\r\rIt is concluded that the changes the site layout and  landscaping  do not constitute a non material amendment to planning permission 22/00907/FUL, and are also at variance with numerous details approved under planning conditions.  These changes both individually and cumulatively are considered to be material. \r\rIt is concluded that the changes do not constitute a non material amendment to planning permission 22/00907/FUL.",

Four major elements make up and contribute to the character of this SASC:-\r(1) Open spaces: This area is particularly well provided with a number of large public and private open spaces, which are semi rural in nature. It includes part of Richmond Park and three golf courses, as well as numbers of playing fields and sports grounds. Richmond Park\rand the golf courses are particularly attractive open spaces consisting of rolling grassland with many mature trees and shrubs.\r(2) Topography: An important part of the character of the SASC is that it is situated on the slopes of Kingston Hill and Coombe Hill, which enhances its visual interest and often affords panoramic views of the Borough and beyond. In addition Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill is a prominent landmark when viewed from many parts of the borough, especially the North of Kingston and New Malden from which it provides a pleasant wooded backcloth. Kingston Hill is also viewed to advantage from the top of Roehampton Vale in Wandsworth LB.\r(3) Buildings: The majority of houses are detached, substantially large and are generally built at much lower densities than in most other parts of the Borough. Although a majority of houses are not of particular architectural or historical interest a significant number are of townscape importance, including a considerable number of Victorian mansions, some of which are listed (many of which are located in the Kingston Hill and George Road L.A.S.C.'s)\r(4) Landscaping and gardens: Most gardens in the SASC contain substantial numbers of trees (many protected by TPOs) and shrubs which often screen buildings from public view that it is the landscape rather than the houses which is the dominant feature of the area. In addition some of the larger houses have grounds running into many acres. Another factor in enhancing the character of the area is that most of the gardens have a very clearly defined means of enclosure, whether by hedge, wall or fence.\r\rThe proposal is for the erection of a single storey  rear extension with roof constructed in aluminium panels  anthracite in colour, with obscure glass panels.  The extension extends 4.7 metres in depth,  with a pitched roof. It is of reduced depth compared with the previously refused scheme (which was 6m in depth) and is shown to align  with the  back wall of the kitchen. The established rear building line of this group of houses is relatively uniform. By aligning with the existing building footprint, the proposed extension  would remaon proportionate to the host building and  woul dnot detract from  the character and appearance of the area and this part of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.  The  impact on the heritage asset would be neutral.  \r\rConclusions on Design and Heritage\rAs such, the proposal is in compliance with Policy D3, HC1 of the London Plan (2021) and Policies CS8, DM 10, DM11 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \rPolicy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD sets out specific guidance when designing a single storey rear extension.\rDepth:\r- If the neighbouring house is set at a lower level the depth of the extension should be reduced\r- If the neighbouring property has a different rear building line then the depth of the extension could be increased\r- In all cases at least 50% of the rear garden should remain\r- Extensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5m in depth\rHeight:\r- a flat roof should not exceed 3m in height\r- a parapet roof should not exceed 3.3m in height\r- a pitched roof should not exceed 4m in height\r\rPolicy Guidance 17 and 32  of the Residential Design SPD  are also relevant  to the assessment of this application and relate to the 45 degree rule and states that The Council applies the '45 degree rule' in assessing development proposals. New buildings or extensions to existing buildings should not encroach on a line drawn at an angle of 45 degrees from the midpoint of the closest window to a habitable room in a neighbouring property.\r\rOfficer Comment:\rThe proposed extension is sited along the shared boundary with 73/75 Vale Crescent.  The extension extends approximately 4.7m beyond the rear elevation of the adjoining building, and is set at a raised level with a 3m wall running the length of this shared boundary. The neighbouring  property is of a mirrored arrangement and  has windows on the main wall and  in the rear projecting wing directly facing the proposed extension. Given the  depth and height of the extension, the proposal is considered overbearing for this ground floor  neighbour and would give  rise to an unreasonable loss of outlook and increased sense of enclosure to  habitable room windows within the ground floor flat at No 73 serving the living room and kitchen.\r\rWith regard to daylight and sunlight, the neighbouring building has a large rear window at the ground floor, and a kitchen window within the projecting wing, which appears to be a similar arrangement to the application site. Whilst detailed drawings have not been provided to show the positioning of neighbouring windows, Officers have undertaken a 45 degree test and consider  that the extension is likely to interrupt the midpoint of the (living room) window on the plan and elevation test. For this reason, it is considered that the proposal would also result in an undue loss of daylight and sunlight to this neighbour.\r\rThe proposal is in conflict with the Residential Design Guide in terms of its depth. The proposed extension is considered to result in an undue loss of amenity to neighbouring residential occupiers, in conflict with Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012) and Residential Design Guide SPD (2013).\r\rFire Safety Assessment\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the road layout out would allow a  fire appliance  outside the site and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rOther Issues:\rThe proposal would provide for additional accommodation as part of the existing flat.  Whilst objections have been received on grounds of disturbance, it is not considered that the proposed extension would result in any unreasonable level of noise or disturbance over what would be expected in a residential area.\rIssues relating to  building maintenance, structural stability etc are covered under separate legislation.\r\rOverall the development is considered to be in conflict with the development plan and as such, planning permission is recommended for refusal.\r\r\r",
    "As set out in pre appication advice issued by teh Council, the applicant is advised that due to the  close separation and siting of neighbouring resident's windows, the extension must be compliant with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residentail Design Guide in terms of its depth and height.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r- 23/02322/HOU - Demolition of rear extension and conservatory, and erection of single storey side and rear extension. Changes to side fenestration. Granted on 25.10.2026 \r\r- 23/01005/HOU - Demolition of lean-to extension and conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension with part first floor extension. Refused on 04.08.2023 for the following reasons:\r\r1) By reason of excessive bulk, the proposed development would not appear proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwellinghouse and would appear incongruous from the wider area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Council's Residential Design Guidance 2012.\r\r2) By reason of depth and siting the proposed development would unduly impact the amenities of the occupiers of No. 62 Worthington Road by reason of overbearing appearance and would lead to an unacceptable loss of daylight and as such the proposed development is contrary to Paragraph 130 of the NPPF 2021, Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would have an additional depth of approx. 4.2m from the existing lean-to extension and a total approximate depth of 9.5m, which would exceed the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 of 3.5m. However, the proposed ground floor extension solely would not be visible from the street and would not be incongruous with the prevailing pattern of development in the immediate surrounding area.\r\rIn regard to the first floor extension, officers acknowledge that the applicant has opted for a flat roof in order to address concerns raised regarding excessive scale in the previously refused application (ref:23/01005/HOU). However, the reduction in overall height and design of the proposed roof it would still not be acceptable due to the limited scale of the dwelling and plot, therefore, the first floor extension would still appearing excessive in scale. First floor extensions on the boundary of a semi-detached property are generally unacceptable and will normally be resisted as mentioned in Policy Guidance 34, of the Residential Design SPD. \r\rOverall, the proposed first-floor extension in conjunction with the ground-floor extension would be a bulky addition and at odds with the host dwelling and the wider area. Therefore, it is considered that there would be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylight/sunlight of the proposed rear/side extension. The assessment demonstrates that the depth and siting of the proposed extensions in relation to neighbouring property No.62 Worthington Road would adversely affect their amenities by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of daylight to their closest ground floor principal habitable room window (reception room).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling .\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing garage and rear conservatory, erection of a x2 double storey side extensions and a part two storey/ part single storey rear extension. Fenestration alteration and new external door.\r\rConsultations\r17 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rTwo representations have been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- The proposal would result in loss of light/sunlight in relation to adjoining properties\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Noise\r- Privacy\rOfficer comment: The above concerns will be addressed with this assessment.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Highway Safety\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey side extensions would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 500mm. The proposed width of the extensions would be less than 50% of the width of the existing dwelling. It is noted that the proposed roofs would not be set down from the existing roof ridge by recommended 500mm, however considering the proposed roof design, it is considered that the side extensions would appear in-keeping with the host dwelling. As such this element of the proposal would be in general compliance with Policy 36. \r\rThe proposed part single part two storey rear extension, given its scale and siting is considered to appear as proportionate addition to the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \rOfficers note concerns raised with written representations regarding the scale of the proposal, however given the generous size of the plot, the proposed separation distances, siting of the proposal and its design, it is considered to be in-keeping with the surrounding area and the existing street scene that contains various style and scale properties. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note comments received within written representations regarding the potential loss of daylight/sunlight in relation to the adjoining properties as the result of the proposal.\r\rHowever, given the siting of the proposal and the proposed separations distances, it is considered that the proposal would pass the 45 and 25 degree rule in relation to all the adjoining properties. It is noted that the adjoining property No 3 Regent Road does not have openings to the side elevation. \r\rAs per submitted plans, all new windows to the side elevations (including the bedroom 4 window) above the ground floor level would be obscure glazed and not openable below 1.7m when measured from the floor level to prevent any undue overlooking. \r\rAs the proposal would seek to provide a residential extension to an existing residential dwelling Officers consider that there would be no material increase in noise or disturbance for the occupiers of neighbouring properties. \r\rIt is further noted that the Environmental Protection Act (1990) provides controls to the Council in the event that any noise should occur that could constitute a statutory nuisance. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting, generous size plot and the proposed scale and design would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLoss of Car Parking\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rRelevant History \r20/02322/CPU - Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 3no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion - Granted 16.11.2020\r20/02602/HOU - Erection of part single, part two storey rear extensions -  Granted 01.03.2021\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of part single, part two storey rear extensions and addition of raised roof light and vent pipe over the rear extension flat roof. The application is retrospective.\r\rConsultation\r1 objection has been received and is summarised as follows. \r - Fumes\r - Noise\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe matters raised in the objection are addressed in the officers assessment. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- other matters \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed development would not fully follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD. The application proposal is a hybrid of the two permissions 20/02602/HOU and 20/02322/CPU with the addition of a rooflight and kitchen/cooker vent to the ground floor rear extension. It is also noted that there are simialr extensions that have been built out at the immediate surrounding neighbouring properties. On balance given the fall back position of the site highlighted in the previous permissions and the immediate site and surroundings in this instance it is considered that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and would not have a adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rAn objection has been raised in regard to light spill and noise from the proposed rooflight and smells from the proposed vent. \r\rIt is considered that the proposed lightwell whilst likely to give off light externally in periods of darkness (at a time when neighbouring occupiers are likley to have their curtains or blinds closed) is unlikely to give off light any greater than that of the ambient surrounding light spill from the existing fenestration of the host property or that of the neighbouring properties which have similar rooflights installed on their properties. The applicants agent has confirmed that the proposed fenestration on the rooflight is fixed shut and non openable. In the event the rooflight was openable it is considered that this would not result in noise any greater than the existing noise that would be generated from the openable fenestration already present in the host property.  On balance it is considered that this element of the proposal would not be cause unaccpetable light pollution or noise to the detriment of neighbouring occupiers existing living conditions. \r\rThe proposal inculdes the siting of a vent on the flat roof of the proposed ground floor rear extension which would serve the domestic kitchen cooker. Whilst it is acknowledged that this may not be the ideal siting for such a vent the vent would be filtered and the smells associated with the vent would be no greater or different to that associated with a normal domestic setting. In addition any nuisance from such a vent would be controlled by the primary legislation under the Control of Pollution Act 1974. On balance it is considered that the proposed vent would not have a detrimental impact on the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers. \r\rOther matters \rA condition is recommended to secure the submission of a fire sfatey strategy to ensure that the proposed development would comply with Policy D12 of the London Plan 2021.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a care home. It is located in a predominantl;y residential area on the north side of Coobme Lane West bewteen the junctions of Brook Gardens and Wolsey Close\r\rConsultation \r\r4 objections have been received. The objections are summarised as follows \r- Light pollution \r- Harm to character of the area \r\rAssessment\r\rThe application relates to the display of advertisements. The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity \r\rThe signage would be on a front boundary wall to the property. \r\rThe front boundary occupies a highly visible and prominent position in the streetscne and is directly opposite and adjacent a number of residential properties. It is considered that the proposed levels of illumiatioon 800 cd/sqm would be excessive and the method of illumination by way of an uplighter would exacerbate the impact of the excessive illumnation and would be inappropritae for its location and purpose. The illumination of the signage as proposed would be an incongruous addition to the host property and by virtue of its siting would be visually intrusive in the streetscene.  \r\rThe porposed illuminated signage would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and would cause less than substantial harm to the non-designated heritage asset of Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Special Area of Strategic Character which the site is located in, failing to preserve or enhance its character and appearance. \r\rThe proposed illuminated signage would harm the amenity of the area by way of causing light pollution due to its method of and excessive illumination to the detriment of the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement. The proposed signage would not prejudice highway safety. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion the proposed signage would not accord with paras 195 - 214 of the NPPF and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Councils adopted LDF Core Strategy.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. There are no Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) on site or on neighbouring sites.\r\rPermission was granted under 22/02378/HOU dated 14.11.2022 for the demolition of existing rear extension, conversion of garage into habitable space, erection of two-storey side, part two storey/part single storey rear extension. Erection of roof extension with rear/ side dormer and rear juliet balcony and installation of 2 nos front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Internal alterations and associated rear landscaping.\r\rThis application seeks to amend this permission.

Internal alterations and associated rear landscaping.) variation to include widening of side wall by 160mm.\r\rFrom the plans provided the following changes have been identified;\r- Built up to the boundary\r- Rear box window at first floor level has been enlarged to include side facing glazing panels\r- New roof lantern to the single storey rear extension\r- Introduction of solar to the flat roof of the rear dormer (visible on the proposed plans but not demonstrated on the proposed elevations)\r\rConsultation\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified and 1 objection has been received stating;\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rPhotographs of the development have been provided and it is appears that the extension, fencing and associated drainage breaches the red line boundary. The submitted drawings do not appear to be consistent with what has been built on site.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: With regards to character and appearance it is noted that no information has been provided with regards to the proposed solar panels. Officers are unable to ascertain if the solar panel would be fixed flat or raised and therefore are unable to confirm that they would not be visible within the streetscene. Officers are therefore also unable to conclude that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. Other changes shown on the drawings such as the enlarged window at the first floor level and the apparent building of the extension over the site boundary would also serve to make the development appear more visually dominant from neighbouring properties.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the small increase brings the building up to/over the boundary, however, guttering and pipework should remain within the boundary of the site and it has not been demonstrated that this has been achieved.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance. Furthermore, the alterations to the proposed bay window at the first floor level which includes side facing glazing would result in a loss of privacy to neighbours. While this impact could be partially mitigated by way of a planning condition ensuring that the side facing glazing is obscurely glazed and non-opening an element of perceived overlooking would remain which is not characteristic of properties in this reltively low density suburban area.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r7 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rNetwork Rail - no objection \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the demolition of existing rear conservatory, erection of single storey rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and installation of 3 nos front rooflights/\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a semi detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks to demolish  the existing rear conservatory  and the erection of a single storey rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with a rear dormer and installation of 3 nos front rooflights.\r\rThe existing rear extension projects a depth  of 1.157m   with an entrance on the eastern elevation.  The proposed rear extension  would be positioned in a similar position  projecting a depth of 4m and and a width of 3.45m. Bifolding doors would be presented on the eastern elevation.  It would have a flat roof eaves height of 3m and be constructed in common stock brick.  The proposed depth of the  single storey rear extension would conflict with the recommended depth of 3.5m for a semi detached dwelling as  set out in Policy Guidance 33.  However, in the context of the existing built form  and the siting of the  rear single storey rear extension  it is considered that the proposal would appear  as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.  \r\rThe application also seeks approval for a  hip to gable roof extension with a rear dormer. Officers note that the totality of the   proposed roof extension would  comply with the volume parameters of the permitted development . The totality of the proposed development which is the subject of this planning application would not be permitted development. In the context of Policy Guidance 39 in the Residential Design SPD the proposed rear dormer is not fully compliant in terms of its  set down from the ridge line nor in terms of its set in from the sides or eaves of the roof position. It is compliant in respect of its position  and relationship with the left side of the roofslope (0.5m, however not compliant in respect of its position with the right side of the roofslope ( 0.262m). However, in the context of its position on the rear roofslope of the dwellinghouse, it is not considered that the proposal would  adversely impact on long distance views from neighbouring properties.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the charactersor appearance of the areas as a result of the proposals. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rOverall, It is considered that the proposed development would have not adversely affect the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

Refused on 05.01.2024 due to the following reason:\r\r1) Due to the excessive width of the proposed vehicle crossover at the back of the footway, the proposed crossover would have an adverse impact on pedestrian and highway safety and the proposal is therefore contrary to Paragraph 111 of the NPPF, 2023, Policy T4f of the London Plan and Policies DM8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted a planning application which was refused due to the initially proposed vehicle crossover, this element of the proposal has now been omitted and the applicant only seeks permission for a front extension (porch) to the existing dwelling.\r\rThe proposed porch would only maintain approximately 200mm distance from the existing bay window falling outside the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 38. However, the porch would be minor in scale and not significantly alter the overall appearance of the house. Additionally, it would appear subordinate and proportionate to the host dwelling and have a pitched roof that would mimic the pitched roof of the main dwelling.\r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, massing and spacing.

    "Condition 5 (Fire Safety Statement) of Planning Permission 23/00730/FUL states:\rPrior to any above ground works (excluding demolition), a Fire Safety Strategy shall be\rsubmitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority. The Fire Safety Strategy shall demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point;\r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems;\r3) Passive and active fire safety measures;\r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread;\r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy;\r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\r\rThe Fire Safety Strategy shall include a statement of competence. \rThe development shall be carried out in accordance with the approved Strategy and thereafter maintained.\r\rReason: In the interests of fire safety and to ensure the safety of all building users in accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rOfficer comment: Notwithstanding the submitted Planning fire Safety Statement, it is considered that insufficient information has been submitted to address the following points:\r\rAppropriate fire alarm systems - the provided statement suggests certain appliances however it is unclear what is being proposed for the proposed development: 'The dwellinghouse shall be provided with an automatic fire detection alarm (….)'\r\rPassive fire safety measures: it is stated: 'The stairway in the main dwelling house shall be enclosed at the basement, ground, first and second levels and leads to a final exit at the ground floor level'. It is unclear if the stairway will be enclosed. \r\rAppropriate construction details: the submitted statement reads: 'The building shall be designed to retain its stability in the event of a fire for a reasonable period. This shall be ensured during detailed design through (...)'. It is not clear if the proposal has been designed as suggested.\r\rFurthermore, the submitted statement does not refer to the entire development as it does not include the outbuilding. \r\rGiven the above, it is considered that insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposal will achieve the highest standards of fire safety, contrary to Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r",
