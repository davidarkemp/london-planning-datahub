    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the walls of the dwelling houses hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Within 3 months of first occupation, evidence must be submitted to the Council confirming that the development hereby permitted has achieved no less than the C02 reductions (ENE1), internal water usage (WAT1) standards equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes Level 4.

    "Prior to above ground works details of the implementation, adoption, maintenance and management of a sustainable drainage system have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The system shall be implemented prior to occupation and thereafter managed and maintained in accordance with the approved details.  Those details shall include a timetable for its implementation, and a management and maintenance plan for the lifetime of the development which shall include the arrangements for adoption by any public body or statutory undertaker, or any other arrangements to secure the effective operation of the sustainable drainage system throughout its lifetime.\rReason: In order to prevent the increased risk of flooding in accordance with Policy CS1 (Climate Change Mitigation) of the Local Development Framework Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall not be occupied until details of secure cycle parking facilities for the occupants of, and visitors to, the development hereby approved have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "Notwithstanding the provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order, 1995 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no extensions (including porches or dormer windows) to the dwelling houses shall be erected within the curtilage.\r\rReason: To safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard the cohesive appearance of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The voids will be constructed as stated in Part 6.0 of the Flood Risk Assessment, ref J-12147 dated 10/04/2019. The voids will be a minimum of 1m wide and 10.78m AOD above existing ground levels in height and with one opening every 5m length of wall on all sides.\r\rReason:  Any loss of flood storage must be compensated for, such that the same volume is available before and after the works and it can freely fill and drain. The compensation must not increase the flood risk elsewhere as required in accordance with the requirements of the Exception test stated in Paragraph 160 of the NPPF, 2019.\r",
    "Before construction of the development commences, the applicant will provide a scheme of maintenance and inspection for the proposed void undercroft.\r\rReason:  This is to ensure that the use of the voids as flood storage compensation can be retained in perpetuity. Regular inspection and set maintenance plan will ensure that they function as designed without taking up flood storage or deflecting flood flows to neighbouring properties.\r",
    "Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe two flats on the upper floors would have roof terraces to provide private outdoor amenity space, which has drawn objection from neighbouring residents due to concerns about overlooking. The terraces would have 1.8m high obscure glazed screens that would be adequate to ensure that there is no unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity and no direct overlooking between the amenity areas of neighbouring properties. Officers consider that whilst there would be an increase in the number of properties within the building which may result in a perceived sense of overlooking from within the units to neighbouring properties, though this would be no greater than what would be expected when properties are aligned in terraces within well-established residential areas; and especially where flatted accommodation is provided.\r\rThe application includes the erection of a single storey extension that would project 7.9m along the side boundary with no. 54 Guilford Avenue. It would have a flat roof finish with a height of 3.5m and so add considerable bulk, scale and mass to the original property. It is considered that this would result in a large expanse of brickwork along the side boundary that would unduly dominate the rear garden area of no. 54 and create an undue sense of enclosure.  On the opposite side, no. 58 has a single storey extension that adjoins the boundary, and whilst the proposed extension would project beyond this, it is considered that it would not over-dominate the neighbour or cause unnacceptable harm to their outlook.\r\rThe proposal includes the subdivision of the existing garden area to provide amenity space for both of the ground floor flats. The garden area for plot 2 would be accessed directly from the property and provide a workable amount of space to be enjoyed. However, plot 1 would not have any direct access to their garden area and would have to leave the property at the front then access the space via a side passageway between nos. 58 and 60. This arrangement is considered to be impractical and inaccessible and may well restrict the enjoyment of the space and the undertaking of day-to-day activities associated with garden space.\r\rThe proposed development would therefore fail to provide truly useable private outdoor amenity space for the future\roccupants  of plot 1 as well as result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon no. 54 in terms of creating an undue sense of enclosure, thereby conflicting with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rAs stated, the proposal involves the erection of a single storey side/rear extension that would project 7.9m along the side boundary of the property, and have a flat roof finish with a height of 3.5m. It is considered that this would add considerable bulk, scale and mass to the property that would not be in keeping with the character and appearance of the original dwelling, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. Applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rAt the regional level, the London Plan requires that the impacts of proposed development on transport capacity and the transport network are fully assessed. Where existing transport capacity is insufficient to allow for the travel generated and no firm plans exist for an increase in capacity, development should either be phased until it is known that the requirements can be met, or otherwise refused. Where necessary, transport assessments and travel plans should be provided in line with TfL guidance. The Mayor wishes to see an appropriate balance being struck between promoting new development and preventing excessive car parking provision that can undermine cycling, walking and public transport use.\r\rTo this end, the London Plan sets out maximum car parking standards which are the basis for considering planning applications. Accordingly, the Core Strategy states the Council's intention to manage on and offstreet parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities. New development should comply with the relevant car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rHowever, the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD makes clear that in some cases, the adopted regional (and/or local) parking standards may not be appropriate and development proposals should be assessed on a case-by-case basis. This is due to the Borough's outer London location, with large areas of low public transport accessibility, poor orbital public transport links, and poor access to parts of Surrey via public transport. In some cases, where adverse impacts on the local area, such as on-street parking issues or constraints to economic growth, can be clearly demonstrated, increased parking provision that exceeds the standards may be considered by the Council.\r\rThe application site has a PTAL score of 2 so the access to public transport is considered to be poor. As stated previously parking within Guilford Avenue is also restricted by a CPZ and whilst the existing property has the benefit of one parking permit that would not be sufficient for the total number of proposed flats. The property does not have the benefit of off-street parking and so there would be no increase in the amount of vehicle movements from the property. The development includes the provision of cycle storage space, which is acceptable in terms of the amount of space and the means of securing the facility.\r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the development would have an acceptable impact on the transport network.",
    "Section 59 of the Highways Act permits the Highway Authority to charge developers for damage caused by excessive weight and movements of vehicles to and from a site.

    "Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy requires development proposals to make adequate provision for waste facilities, including recycling facilities, and to ensure that these are located where they cause minimal adverse impact on the amenities of the local area, and where they can be adequately assessed and serviced.\r\rThe application states that space for four bins would be provided within the front garden of the property, though there are no details as to how the bins would be stored to limit their impact on the streetscene. Secure facilities could be provided within the garden areas to both of the ground floor flats, and therefore it is considered that appropriate that details should be secured via an appropriate condition if permission were forthcoming.  Subject to the satisfaction of a future condition it is considered that the propsoed development would achieve complaince with Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rAs previously stated, on-street parking in Guilford Avenue is restricted through the CPZ designation. Whilst Officers note that the proposed development proposes no off-street car parking and the applicant has agreed in principal to enter into a legal agreement to car cap the scheme and preclude future occupants from obtaining on-street car parking permits, a completed legal agreement to this effect has not been received.  In the absence of such a legal agreement the applicant has not adequately demonstrated that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety and would not result in inconsiderate parking on surrounding streets and negatively contribute to on-street car parking pressure in the area, thereby conflicting with Paragraph 109 of the NPPF 2019 and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012.",

    "In conclusion and for the reasons set out above it is considered that the benefits of the scheme associated with the delivery of three net additional housing units are significantly and demonstrably outweighed by the disbenefits of the scheme associated with the provision of poor standards of accommodation, the unacceptable advserse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity, unacceptable and inaccessible private outdoor amenity space provision, the loss of a three bedroom unit and insufficient provision of three bedroom dwellings on site and the adverse impact on highways safety, on-street car parking provision and inconsiderate parking in the absence of a legal agreement. The proposal would thefore be contrary to the relevant policies of the NPPF 2019, the London Plan, the Core Strategy 2012 and supplementary planning guidance.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The application property is a three-storey, terraced, family sized dwelling located on the west side of Guilford Avenue, which is a well-established residential area. The adjoining properties either side of the application unit have both been converted into flats and there are similar properties in the vicinity. The property does not benefit from any off-street parking and the site falls within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ). The buildings on the site are not listed, or locally listed and the site is not located within a conservation area.\r\rThe proposal is to convert the existing dwelling into four self-contained flats spread across the three floors of the property. The two ground floor flats would have access to their own garden space at the rear of the property, with the upper floor flats having a roof terrace for outdoor amenity space. The proposed flats would comprise 3 x one bedroom units and 1 x 2 bedroom unit.\r\rThere is no planning history that is relevant to this application.\r\r45 neighbouring properties were consulted on the application, with two letters of objection received. The\rplanning issues raised in the responses are summarised as follows:\r- Proposed ground floor extension will be higher and longer than the extension at no. 58 resulting in loss of light and poor outlook\r- The introduction of balconies are not a feature of neighbouring properties and result in overlooking issues\r\rOther consultations\rWaste & Recycling - No comments received\rDC & Cycle Parking - No comments received\rPolicy - No comments received\rClimate & Sustainability - No comments received\rStreet Name & Numbering - No comments received\rLead Local Flood Authority - No comments received\rTransport for London - No objection\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer - No comments received\r\rThe key planning considerations are:\r- The principle of development;\r- The character, appearance and quality of the proposed accommodation;\r- The proposed housing mix;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- The impact of the development on the transport network; \r- Refuse and recycling; \r- Legal agreement; and,\r- Community Involvement Levy (CIL).",
    "Paragraph 118 of the NPPF, 2019 directs that planning policies and decisions should \"promote and support the development of under-utilised land and buildings, especially if this would help to meet identified needs for housing where land supply is constrained and available sites could be used more effectively\".\r\rParagraph 123 goes on to say that \"Where there is an existing or anticipated shortage of land for meeting identified housing needs, it is especially important that planning policies and decisions avoid homes being built at low densities, and ensure that developments make optimal use of the potential of each site.\" \r\rParagraph 11 makes it clear that in terms of the presumption of sustainable development and in relation to decision taking development proposals which accord with an up to date development plan should be approved without delay.\r\rRegional policy supports this stance and policies 3.3 and 3.4 of the London Plan March 2016 (consolidated with alterations since 2011) emphasise that the Mayor recognises the pressing need for more homes in London and will work with relevant partners to ensure that housing need is met.\r\rAt the local level LDF Policy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  These have increased since the adoption of the Core Strategy and the London Plan, 2016 sets a target of 635 new residential dwellings per year.  This application would provide 3 net additional units on site which would make a positive contribution towards this target.\r\rIt should be noted that currently the Council is unable to demonstrate a five year supply of deliverable housing sites. \r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole.  These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of this planning application.\r",
    "Policy DM13 of the Core Strategy seeks to encourage a mix of unit sizes and types by providing a minimum of 30% of dwellings as 3 or more bedroom units. Any shortfall in this provision would require a demonstration that to do so would be unsuitable or unviable. As the proposal would result in the creation of four units, a net gain of three, then at least one of the units should be a 3 bedroom unit in order to be policy compliant. The development would not provide a 3 bedroom unit and the applicant has not provided any substantiated evidence to demonstrate that the provision of such a unit of accommodation would be unsuitable or unviable.  Therefore, the proposed development would conflict with Policy DM13.\r\rIn terms of standards of accommodation, the application seeks to provide 3 x one bedroom flats and a 1x 2 bedroom flat. With regards to bedroom sizes the proposed development would meet the standards set by both the London Plan and the nationally described standards. However, at ground floor level, the unit identified as plot 2 has only one bedroom and its only source of natural light is via rooflights. This would deny the occupants of the flat an outlook from a habitable room which is considered to constitute a sub-standard of accommodation. Additionally, the bedroom associated with plot 1, whilst having a window looking out onto a small courtyard area, would face a brickwall 2.4m away and would have a 2m high boundary wall in close proximity. This would provide a poor outlook and insufficient levels of natural light for future occupants.  This would also provide a substandard form of accommodation. Therefore, both plots 1 and 2 would provide a sub-standard for of accommodation, thereby conflicting with policy DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.",
