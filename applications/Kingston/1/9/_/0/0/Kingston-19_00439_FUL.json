    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received stating\r- Loss of Light\r- Unbalance pair of semi detached\r- Detract from streetscene\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comments: \rSingle Storey Rear Extension - Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposed development would exceed the recommended depths for single storey rear extensions as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not appear disproportionate given existing surrounding development. The proposed development is therefore considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design. It is considered that there would not be any unacceptable adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area in this specific regard.\r\rHip to Gable Conversion - Paragraph 4.29 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that \"proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property. This may be particularly true when proposing to extend the roof of a semi-detached property, which would upset the visual balance of the two houses, particularly when viewed in the context of other houses in the street or wider area.\" The proposed gable roof form would visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached dwellings at Nos. 240 and 242 Hook Road. It is noted that No. 242 Hook Road (the other half of the pair of semi-detached properties) has its original hipped roof intact. As a result, it is considered that the proposed hip to gable conversion would have a harmful impact to the character and appearance of the street scene on Hook Road. The planning history attached to the application site shows that a Certificate of Lawfulness application has not been approved for a hip to gable conversion.  As such, it cannot be argued that a fall-back position has been established under permitted development rights.\r\rRear Dormer Roof Extension - Due to its excessive size it is considered that the proposed dormer extension would not appear as subordinate addition, contrary to Policy Guidance 39 of the Residential Design SPD. It is acknowledged that rear dormer extensions can be constructed under permitted development rights. However, a Certificate of Lawfulness has not been approved at this site for a dormer of this size and as such, it is considered that a fall back position has not been established. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rSingle Storey Rear Extension - The proposal would fail the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest ground floor habitable room window at No. 242 Hook Road. It would be sited hard up against the shared boundary. On this basis, it is considered that the proposed development would be unneighbourly and would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of 242 Hook Road by reason of sense of enclosure and loss of outlook. The proposal is therefore considered to conflict with Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rHip to Gable and Rear Dormer Roof Extension- Due to their position, it is considered that the proposed hip to gable conversion and rear dormer extension would not unduly impact on the amenities of neighbouring properties, in terms of daylight/sunlight, sense of enclosure or overbearing impact. The windows and Juliet balconies within the proposed dormer would have a similar outlook to the existing first floor bedroom windows. The proposed roof lights in the front roof slope would be positioned at a high level.  As such, it is considered that the proposed development would not give rise to a material loss of privacy or overlooking for neighbouring occupiers. Overall, the proposal would not have an adverse impact on the amenities enjoyed by neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets\r- The impact of the development on trees\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extensions would be large in scale but this would not be immediately apparent from any public vantage points. The application property and in particular, the proposed location for the extensions, is well screened by the irregular shape of the plot, vegetation along the front boundary, and the presence of a large outbuilding at the very front of 42 Adelaide Road. Furthermore, the extensions would be set well back from the street, with the front face being approximately 20m from the back edge of the pavement.\r\rTaking the above into account, the proposed extensions would have a limited impact on the character and appearance of the area. In any case, much of the guidance within the Council's Residential Design SPD is reflected in the proposed design: the extensions would be set well back from the facade of the dwelling; the ridge lines would be set well down from the ridge of the main roof; and the western flank wall would be set away from the boundary with number 42, with the flank wall of the first floor set in even further.\r\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to be considered are 38 and 42 Adelaide Road. The impact of the extensions on the amenities of the occupiers of these properties would be mitigated by the presence of the existing two storey rear extension and the presence of the existing garage. \r\rWith regard to 38 Adelaide Road, it is noted that the extensions close to the boundary would occupy largely the same footprint as the existing two storey extension and would only exceed the rear building line of number 38 by a very limited amount. Turning to 42 Adelaide Road, officers consider that the extensions would be appropriately set away from the boundary and again, they would only marginally exceed the rear building line of this property.\r\rThe submitted plans show a first floor window facing number 38, which is noted as being obscure glazed. It is considered necessary to secure this obscure glazing by way of condition to ensure that the privacy of the occupants of number 38 would not be adversley affected. \r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
    "Policy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate at least two off street car parking spaces, which is in accordance with local and regional parking standards. The proposed alterations to the boundary treatments would involve the widening of the gateway, which would improve visibility, whilst making no changes to the crossover itself. Therefore the proposal would comply with Policies DM9 and DM10.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                          \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r                                              \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The site is located within the Claremont Road Conservation Area and the application property is a locally listed building. The significance of the conservation can be summarised as part of the original Surbiton \"New Town\" conceived by Thomas Pooley. Development started in 1838, and centred around the landscaped Claremont Crescent Gardens. The significance of the application property is as a well preserved and attractive period property which displays a markedly different layout and design to the standard Pooley villas, suggesting that they may have been rebuilt later in the 19th century.\r\rThe proposal is sympathetic to the design of the existing building insofar as it appears to replicate many of the architectural features of the existing dwelling and boundary treatments. Although it is acknolwedged that the extensions would somewhat upset the balance of the property and its adjoining semi-detached neighbour, they would be relatively well hidden by the boundary wall and vegetation at the front of the site and would be set far enough back from the front wall of the property that they would clearly read as subordinate extensions and, in officers view, would not affect the ability to appreciate the significance of the existing part of the property. Likewise, the significance of the conservation area as a whole would be just as appreciable as it currently is.\r\rThe above assessment is heavily reliant on suitable detailed design, particularly regarding the quality of facing materials used and the arrangement of the windows, which should be secured by conditions. Subject to these conditions, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in harm to the significance of either the Claremont Road Conservation Area or the locally listed application property.\r\rThe London Plan states that existing trees of value should be retained and any loss as a result of development should be replaced following the \"right place, right tree\" principle set out in the London Tree and Woodland Framework 2005. The LDF Core Strategy echoes this intention, stating that the Council will ensure new developments protect and promote biodiversity through, amongst other things, appropriate tree planting.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD provides further guidance, with Policy Guidance 7 stating that there will generally be a presumption against the loss of trees, regardless of whether or not they are protected by a tree preservation order or their location within a conservation area. Where a development proposal involves the removal of a tree on the site, the applicant will be expected to demonstrate that the tree is in poor health and that two replacement trees can be provided to compensate for the loss of that tree.\r\rOfficer comment: The Council's Tree and Landscape Officer has assessed the submitted arboricultural impact assessment, method statement and tree protection plan and is satisfied that the proposal would ensure the health and longevity of the trees on the site. A condition should be imposed to ensure that the works are carried out in strict accordance with these documents.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
