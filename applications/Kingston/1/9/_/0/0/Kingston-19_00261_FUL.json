    "Prior to commencement of any above ground level development a scheme of noise insulation/reduction shall be submitted to ensure that the noise level of 35 dBLAeq,16 hour in living rooms and bedrooms during the daytime (0700 to 2300 hours) and 30 dBLAeq,8 hour and 45 dBLAmax during the night time (measured with F time-weighting and between 2300 and 0700 hours) in bedrooms in accordance with B88233:2014 shall not be exceeded. Where these levels cannot be met with windows open appropriate acoustic ventilation should be provided so that the room can be sufficiently ventilated. The acoustic performance of any passive vent, variable speed mechanical air supply unit or whole house ventilation must be sufficient to ensure that the noise level standards given above are not compromised.\rReason: In order to protect future occupiers against traffic, commercial, and railway noise in accordance with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

The development shall be implemented and retained in accordance with the agreed details. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development shall either be stored within the dedicated store/area as shown on the approved plans, and that no refuse or recycling material shall be stored or placed for collection on the public highway or pavement, except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of refuse facilities to the satisfaction of the Council in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "No development shall take place including any works of demolition until a construction logistics plan has been submitted to and been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved plan/statement shall be adhered to throughout the construction period. The statement shall provide for:\r\r(a) Provision for loading/unloading materials.\r(b) Storage of plant, materials and operatives vehicles.\r(c) Temporary site access.\r(d) Signing system for works traffic.\r(e) Measures for the laying of dust, suppression of noise and abatement of other nuisance arising from development works.\r(f) Location of all ancillary site buildings.\r(g) Measures to protect any tree, shrubbery and other landscape features to be retained on the site during the course of development.\r(h) Means of enclosure of the site.\r(i) Wheel washing equipment.\r(j) The parking of vehicles of the site operatives and visitors\r(k) The erection and maintenance of security hoarding.\r\rReason:  These details are required prior to commencement of development because the relevant works would take place at the beginning of the construction phase and in order to safeguard the amenities of the surrounding residential occupiers and to safeguard highway safety and the free flow of traffic in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r\r",
