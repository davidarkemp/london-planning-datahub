    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling with a detached garage.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a detached double garage with habitable accommodation in the roof space, following demolition of the existing garage.\r\rConsultation\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. 2 objections were received. The material issues raised are summarised as follows:\r\r- Scale and height\r- Detailed design\r- Loss of privacy\r- Highway safety\r- The intended use of the building\r\rOne neutral comment was also received, which raised concerns about the use of the building.\r\rOfficer Response: These issues will be considered below.\r\rSurbiton CAAC - Objection on the grounds of inappropriate external finishes.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact on heritage assets;\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Highway safety;\r- Car parking; and\r- Trees and landscape.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe area surrounding the site is not characterised by large, detached garages, although there are a few examples, notably immediately adjacent to the site at 12 Sylvan Gardens. This has a fairly straightforward design, with a rectangular footprint, two garage doors and a first floor window in the front elevation, and a gable roof. While its scale is towards the upper bounds of what might be considered reasonable, it nevertheless has the appearance one might expect of a garage on the plot of a large, detached, suburban dwelling. \r\rIn contrast, the proposed garage would have an unusual design, with a two storey structure topped by a flat roof projecting out from the eastern side elevation. It would also be excessive in scale, rising to a maximum height of 6.6m above ground level (0.6m above the adjacent garage) and having a footprint of approximately 65sqm (30% larger than the adjacent garage). The proposed siting of the building would serve to emphasise its scale, since it would be positioned well forward of the adjacent garage, achieving only a very slight degree of separation from the back edge of the pavement of Sylvan Gardens. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Sylvan Gardens street scene, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area. The significance of the conservation area is as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 grade II listed building by the architect John Nash. \r\rAs noted above, officers consider that the proposed development would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. It follows that the development would fail to preserve the character and appearance of the area.\r\rIn addition to the concerns highlighted above, officers consider that the proposed use of uPVC windows would fail to respect the high quality, historic character of the area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the conservation area. The public benefits of the proposal will be weighed up in the conclusion of this report.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the presence of the existing garage at 12 Sylvan Gardens, officers consider that the proposed development would not appear overbearing or unduly deprive neighbouring occupiers of natural light. The proposed roof lights in the western roof slope may provide some views over 12 Sylvan Gardens but these would largely be obscured by the adjacent garage and could be further limited through the imposition of a condition requiring obscure glazing. Subject to this condition, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rHighway Safety\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rThe existing garage is not served by a vehicular crossover and none is proposed under the current application. While vehicles in the area are likely to be moving at a slow speed and pedestrians are unlikely to frequently use the pavement in front of the garage, manoeuvering vehicles across the pavement into and out of a double garage would pose a danger to both other vehicles and pedestrians alike. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy T4 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy DM8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require new development to provide facilities on-site for cyclists as appropriate, including showers, lockers and secure, convenient cycle parking, in accordance with the minimum standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rThe existing dwelling benefits from a driveway large enough to safely accommodate two vehicles, as well as an integrated single garage and the detached single garage that would be demolished as part of the development. The proposal would result in a net increase of one on-site car parking space, bringing the total for the site to five spaces.\r\rPolicy T6.1 of the London Plan states that a property of the size in question, in an area with a PTAL of 0, should have a maximum of 1.5 car parking spaces. A higher level of provision may be considered but only where this would support additional family housing. As the proposal would not support additional family housing, it is considered to be contrary to policies T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan and policy DM8 of the Core Strategy.\r\rTrees and Landscape\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rThe application form states that there are neither any trees or hedges on the application site nor any trees and hedges adjacent to the site that may be important as part of local landscape character. This is clearly false, since the site contains a large number of trees/hedges on the site (notably a leylandii hedge immediately adjacent to the site of the proposed garage) and the character of the area is defined, in large part, by its sylvan character. All of the trees on the site are protected by virtue of being located within a conservation area.\r\rThe applicant has failed to consider these trees and hedges in any of the application documents. It follows that the applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable impact on trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan and policy DM10 of the Core Strategy.\r\rOther Matters\rConcerns have been raised by neighbouring occupiers regarding the intended use of the building. While the building may be of a size and design such that it could potentially be converted to a self-contained dwelling at a later date, this is not what has been applied for and is something that would require further permission should the current application be granted. Accordingly, officers have assessed the application on the basis of what has been submitted.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development, by reason of the scale, form, height and siting of the proposed garage, would appear as an unduly prominent and incongruous feature within the Sylvan Gardens street scene, resulting in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe proposed development would also result in an excessive concentration of car parking spaces on the site, which could not be accessed in a safe manner. The proposal is therefore contrary to the aims of promoting sustainable transport and ensuring the safety of highway users, and is contrary to policies T4, T6 and T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies DM8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to these harms.\r\rThe applicant has failed to demonstrate that the proposed development would not result in harm to trees worthy of retention. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy G7 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rFinally, the proposed development would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. This must be weighed against the public benefits of the scheme.\r\rThe public benefits of the scheme are effectively nil. The applicant suggests that it would alleviate parking issues on surrounding streets but officers do not accept this, since the site is already well served by car parking spaces and the proposal would not provide for vehicular access to the proposed garage. Officers therefore consider that there are no public benefits to the scheme that might outweigh the harm to the significance of the conservation area. It follows that the proposal is contrary to policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rThe only other benefits associated with the proposal are those very limited, private benefits associated with improving the quantity and quality of the accommodation at the site. Officers attach limited weight to this.\r\rThe impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable. This is a neutral matter.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no objections have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the current application is a revision of previously refused application ref: 20/02708/HOU. The principle issue with the refused application was the extension of the existing rear dormer. The proposal of this refused application would have resulted in an incongruous that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposed rear dormer does not extend the existing rear dormer within the current application thereby addressing this issue.\r\rThe proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the scale and siting of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises an electricity substation to the north of Grafton Road, New Malden.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a replacement substation following demolition of the existing substation.\r\rConsultation\r105 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rRBK Highways and Transportation - No objection.\r\rRBK Environmental Health - No objection, subject to a condition relating to construction working hours.\r\rOfficer Response: The nearest neighbouring residential property is approximately 50m away on the southern side of Grafton Road. Officers therefore consider that a condition controlling the construction working hours would be unnecessary.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issue in the assessment of the application is the impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe site is in a relatively secluded location away from public view and the proposed development would therefore have a very limited impact on the character and appearance of the area. In any event, the proposed replacement substation would be of similar dimensions to the existing substation and would be finished in the same materials.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and in these respects the proposal is in accordance with policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and in the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",

    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The application site is located in Southborough Conservation Area\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood CAAC - no objection\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Impact to the Southborough Conservation Area.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey rear extension would not strictly conform to the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, the proposed development would have a modest height and roof form that is in keeping with the original dwelling. As such, officers consider that the proposed development would appear a subordinate and appropriate addition to the original dwelling and, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The significance of the Southborough Conservation Area is as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash. As noted above, officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area, but rather preserve it. As previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

One representation was received.\r\rConcerns were raised in relation to fencing between the application property and No.8 Landseer Road and the proposed building of a structure on the shared boundary, or on the adjoining property. \r\rBoth matters are civil and are to be addressed privately between the parties.\r\rConcerns were also raised with impact on residential amenity - this is covered later in the assessment.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rRear Extension\r\rThe proposed single storey extension would project 3.5m and 6m from the rear wall of the existing building, with a flat roof design (3m in height) and 2no roof lights, one of which is a lantern style.  \r\rThe extension would align with No.8 Landseer Road and extend 4.4m across the rear elevation. The remainder of the elevation would be 6m in depth, but would maintain the setback of the existing rear extension that is 3m deep. As such, the extension would project only additional 3m beyond the built form which already exists to the side adjoining No.12 Landseer Road.\r\rSide Extension\rThe is a minor extension to the existing side extension of 1 m and the removal and replacement of a ground floor side window. \r\rThe external materials are satisfactory and would match the existing building. \r\rThe proposed addition of a window to the side elevation at first floor is satisfactory subject to the use of obscure glazing to be secured by condition.\r\rThe proposed alterations to the front elevation will involve removal of a garage door to be replaced with a smaller door and window.  There is evidence of similar alterations in the street and on this basis officers consider these alterations to be acceptable. It is noted that existing plans show that the garage has already been altered internally and couldn't be used for the parking of a motor vehicle. The proposed development would retain sufficient space for the storage of bicycles. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe extensions are single storey, to the rear and either align with, or are sufficiently set back from buildings on neighbouring properties. None of the proposed windows or doors present concerns in terms of overlooking, loss of privacy, or daylight and sunlight.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThere is provision for parking on site and the loss of the garage is not considered to have any impact on the provision of parking in the immediate area.   \r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level.

    "Application Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey detached building.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of single storey front, rear and side elevations. \r\r\r\r\rConsultation\r\r9 properties were notified of the proposal. 2 representations were received.  The material planning concerns are summarised below:\r\rThe development does not reflect the character of other houses within the street\rInappropriate design/layout\rAn existing window on the side elevation that is not shown on the drawings and associated loss of privacy\r\rOther concerns were raised regarding the intended use of the extension labelled storage, however the property is a residential dwelling and therefore limited to activities of a residential nature and scale. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\r\rThe development includes extensions to all elevations of the building as follows:\r\rFront elevation - 2m extension to accommodate a new front porch and roof;\r\rSide elevation (North east) - 8m side extension set back 2m from the front elevation, maintains existing set back from the boundary;\r\rRear elevation - 3.4m deep on one side and 2.5m on the other to create a full width extension; \r\rSide elevation (South east) - 10m deep, located directly on the boundary, no setback from the front elevation. Garage door to the front elevation, window and door to rear elevation.\r\r\rAll extensions would be single storey, comprise a pitched roof design 2.5 in height to the eaves and use materials to match the existing. \r\rThe siting and design of the proposed window and doors are considered acceptable.\r\rWhilst the majority of works raises no officer objection, the side extension (left hand side when viewed from the street) raises concerns in relation to its overall scale and design.\r\rIn particular, the extension would not be setback from the front elevation (contrary to SPD Policy Guidance 35) and result in a 12m extension the full length of the host building. There is a complete lack of any detail or punctuation to the side elevation of the extension, with little consideration given to the overall relationship of the extension and its relationship between the host building and neighbouring properties. \r\rThe combination of the excessive depth and poor design of this side extension, result in an unsatisfactory appearance to neighbouring properties. \r\rOfficers acknowledge the scale of homes in the surrounding area however further consideration is considered necessary to  better reflect the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the proportions of the host building.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers do not consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed side extension ( south east elevation) would extend the full length of the host building, directly on the boundary, from the front wall of the host building to the rear wall of the extended part of the building. This would result in a blank wall extension 12.5m in length with no articulation or window detail to soften its appearance to the adjoining properties on Berrylands. In particular Nos.41 and 43  Berrylands that are immediately adjacent to the extension and would look directly at the extension from the rear of their properties. \r\r\rThe combination of the extensive depth and solid form of the extension is considered to have an undue impact on the visual amenities of adjoining properties. Whilst officers raise no objection to a side extension in principle, it is not considered the design has taken into account the visual amenity of surrounding properties. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would not be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be approved, officers conclude that planning permission should be REFUSED.\r\r",
