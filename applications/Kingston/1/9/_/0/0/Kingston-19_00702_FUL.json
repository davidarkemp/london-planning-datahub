    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe description of works is not sufficient, but beyond this it's intent is still clear, to reduce the trees in question by an unspecified amount, but enough to lessen the leaf fall into the gutters. The best way to prevent leaf fall into the gutters is not to reduce the trees it is to install a gutter guard to prevent the ingress of the leaves whilst continuing to allow the correct drainage of water from the roof. Furthermore, as Silver Birch do not happily tolerate reduction works and particulraly not in maturity, these works are excessive and could cause the trees to go into terminal decline. Lastly, the small branches that have fallen and are shown in the photos are simply small deadwood that is naturally produced by any tree in maturity.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse & grant lesser works as follows:\r\rT.1-T.3 Silver Birch - Deadwood & removal of ivy only.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works to T.2 & T.3 are acceptable and not excessive in mainting these smaller and less visible trees. The works to T.1 are more drastic, however, the tree has become excessively top heavy without any inner growth within the crown. Looking at the photos, this may be Ash Dieback taking hold or equally it may be poor past management, but either way, the works to reduce it will hopefully encourage new growth and recovery.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",

None of the requisite information was submitted in support of this application and in such circumstances, as the Council have not been provided with evidence demonstrating the involvement of the tree in subsidance related property damage, the Council obviously have a duty to refuse the application.
