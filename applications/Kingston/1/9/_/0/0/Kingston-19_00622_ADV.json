    "The proposed advertisement display by virtue of its size, siting and design would be visually intrusive creating an incongruous addition to the streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposal would accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Community Infrastructure Levy (CIL) to the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL).\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or Â£2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \r\rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the CIL calculations.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or CIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email cil@kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rNo impact upon public amenity due to location of trees to rear of property so therefore the Council decision should be one of no objection by default.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
