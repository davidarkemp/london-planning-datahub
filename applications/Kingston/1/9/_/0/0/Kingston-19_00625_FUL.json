    "The proposed development by virtue of its size and siting would result in a visually intrusive and incongruous addition to the street scene that would compete with existing street furniture and sign age creating street clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the area and would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Surbiton Town Centre Conservation Area. It is considered that the proposed development would be harmful to the Conservation Area, albeit less than substantial, however, this harm is not outweighed by any public benefits. The proposal would not accord with section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and guidance / policy in the National Planning Policy Framework. \r",
