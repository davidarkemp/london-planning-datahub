    "The refuse and recycling facilities as shown on the approved plans shall be provided prior to beneficial occupation of the development to which this permission relates and shall be permanently retained thereafter. The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies 5.17 and 7.4 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls, etc Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\"\r",

This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor. \r",

The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans. \r",
