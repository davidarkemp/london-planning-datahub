    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are adequately justified on the basis of reducing loading to upper crown following historic storm damage which has not healed well and remains susceptable to wind damage in its weakened state.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Trees can be clearly seen on Google Street View.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works to contine maintenance regime of pollarding for health and safety and for tree health reasons.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rRemoval has become necessary due to fungal infection and associated advanced basal decay. The tree is of a significant size and leaning heavily over a neighbouring property, its remoavl is therefore very necessary for health and safety reasons. The applicant may however seek to remove in portions leaving a standing monolith for habitat for a few years. As this is the case it is not possible to seek replacement planting which would reuire complete removal immediatly to facilitate. Additional large trees are already in situ adjacent within the same garden and will make adequate replacement for the removal, filing the gap over time. The requirement to plant a replacement is therefore removed.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rApropriate minor works with no loss to public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
