    "The Site\rThe site comprises a two storey semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe Proposal\rThe application seeks the removal of condition 6 (removal of permitted development rights) of planning permission 11/14027/HOU, which reads as follows:\r\rNotwithstanding the provisions of part 1 of schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted development) Order, 1995 (or any order revoking or re-enacting this order) no outbuilding shall be erected within the curtilage of the dwelling house.\r\rReason: to safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard cohesive appearance of the development in accordance with policies BE11 (Design of new buildings and extensions), BE12 (Layout and amenity of buildings and extensions), H1 (protection of residential amenities), STR6 (Conserving and enhancing the built environment) and T1 (Transport Safety) of the Royal Kingston Upon Thames Unitary Development Plan First Alteration'.\r\rIt should be noted that the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order 1995 has since been replaced by the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The condition in question has the effect of removing the rights afforded by Class E of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the current Order.\r\rConsultations\r10 properties were notified of the proposal. One objection was received but the objector did not provide their full address, meaning the objection should not be taken into account.\r\rHowever, the subject matter of the objection, namely that extensions should not occupy more than 50% of the curtilage of the original property, is straightforward to address. It should be noted that there is no restriction on permitted development rights for extensions at the site. The objection is therefore taken to refer to any additions to the site, including outbuildings. Since not occupying more than 50% of the curtilage is one of the criteria of Class E (Paragraph E.1(b)), the removal of condition 6 as proposed would not allow outbuildings to cover more than 50% of the curtilage.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land without conditions previously attached. In this case, the application is to remove condition 6 (removal of permitted development rights) of planning permission 11/14027/HOU.\r\rWhile this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development was nonetheless established by the granting of 11/14027/HOU and Section 73(2) of the Act explicitly states that \"on such an application, the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which permission should be granted\". It would therefore be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rOfficers are mindful of changes in planning policy circumstances since the granting of the original permission, including the publication of the revised National Planning Policy Framework (\"NPPF\") 2019, the publication of the London Plan 2021, and the adoption of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers have not identified any material changes in site circumstances over the same period.\r\rParagraph 53 of the NPPF states that \"planning conditions should not be used to restrict national permitted development rights unless there is clear justification to do so\". Paragraph 55 goes on to state that planning conditions should be kept to a minimum and only imposed where they are \"necessary, relevant to planning and to the development to be permitted, enforceable, precise and reasonable in all other respects\". \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance (\"NPPG\") states that \"conditions restricting the future use of permitted development rights or changes of use may not pass the test of reasonableness or necessity… Area-wide or blanket removal of freedoms to carry out small scale domestic and non-domestic alterations that would otherwise not require an application for planning permission are unlikely to meet the tests of reasonableness and necessity\". \r\rThe main issue in this case is therefore, whether the condition, having regard to the reasons given for originally imposing it, meets the tests as set out by Paragraph 55 of the NPPF 2019. \r\rThe stated reason for imposing the condition is as follows:\r\rTo safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard cohesive appearance of the development in accordance with policies BE11 (Design of new buildings and extensions), BE12 (Layout and amenity of buildings and extensions), H1 (protection of residential amenities), STR6 (Conserving and enhancing the built environment) and T1 (Transport Safety) of the Royal Kingston Upon Thames Unitary Development Plan First Alteration'.\r\rPrivacy and Amenity\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIn terms of privacy, officers note that Class E does not permit the erection of outbuildings with more than a single storey. It would not therefore facilitate any high level windows which might give rise to extensive views over neighbouring properties. Since the land on the site is relatively flat, and therefore any views from ground floor level windows could be effectively limited by boundary treatments, officers consider that the removal of condition 6 would not have any material adverse impact on the privacy of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rIn terms of overbearing appearance and loss of light, Class E contains limitations on the dimensions of any permitted outbuildings, particularly where these are located within 2m of the boundary of the curtilage of the site (maximum height of 2.5m). While it is recognised that Class E allows outbuildings to cover up to and including 50% of the original curtilage, which would result in a very large outbuilding, this situation is highly unusual and it is highly unlikely that an outbuilding of this size would be considered incidental to the enjoyment of the dwellinghouse.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers are satisfied that the removal of condition 6 would not have any material adverse impacts on the privacy or amenity of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rAmenity Space\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have a minimum of 50m2 of private garden (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third), where the prevailing character allows.\r\rThe rear garden at the application site measures approximately 160m2. Even in the highly unlikely, worst case scenario that 50% of the original curtilage were to be occupied by an outbuilding, the rear garden would still comfortably exceed the requirements of Policy Guidance 13. Officers therefore consider that the removal of condition 6 would not prejudice the provision of adequate amenity space at the site. \r\rCohesive Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rGiven the layout of the site, an outbuildings erected under Class E would be located within the rear portion of the site and would not be readily visible from any public vantage points. Therefore, any impact on the character and appearance of the area would be very limited. Furthermore, as noted above, outbuildings erected under Class E are subject to limitations as to their dimensions, which would further limit any visual impact.\r\rOfficers are therefore satisfied that the removal of condition 6 would not prejudice the cohesive appearance of the development or otherwise have any material adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rConclusion\rIn light of the above, officers conclude that the imposition of condition 6 is not necessary to safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space, or safeguard cohesive appearance of the development.\r\rOfficers consider it likely that the primary motivation for imposing the condition was that the granting of the original permission (for an extension) was, in part, justified by the removal of existing outbuildings. However, the extension itself is unremarkable, consisting of a 3.5m deep, 3.3m high projection across the rear elevation. In the absence of any exceptional site circumstances, officers consider that the extension would have been acceptable regardless of the removal of any existing structures on the site and that the erection of any new outbuildings on the site now would not have any greater impact than at other neighbouring properties, where the rights afforded by Class E remain intact. Officers therefore conclude that the retention of condition 6 would be unreasonable.\r\rOfficers have assessed condition 6 of 11/14027/HOU against the tests as set out at Paragraph 55 of the NPPF and conclude that it does not meet the tests of reasonableness or necessity, having regard to the stated reasons for imposing the condition. Accordingly, it is recommended that permission be granted for the development without condition 6 attached.\r\rCondition 1 must also be removed since the original implementation period for the permission has long since expired and cannot be extended under S73. \r\rIt is recommended that condition 3, which removes permitted development rights for the insertion of windows in the flank walls of extensions, also be removed. Since the extension is single storey, it would be unreasonable and unnecessary to retain this condition in the interests of privacy and amenity.\r\rCondition 5 is no longer necessary since the structures required to be removed by the condition have already been removed. Accordingly, it is recommended that this condition be removed. \r\rConditions 2 and 4 remain necessary in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. However, it is recommended that these be updated to reflect current policies.",

While the depth of the proposed extension is above the parameters of the Residential Design Guide SPD (3-3.5m), given the nature of the site and that neighbouring properties benefit from existing rear extensions, it would not appear out of scale with the host property or surrounding area. The proposed rear extension would have a gable roof which would be in keeping with the roof form of the original dwelling and surrounding area.\r\rThe existing parapet wall bordering No.72 Gloucester Road would extend 3m further in depth to be in line with the proposed rear extension, and reach a height of approx 2.9m. A parapet wall is proposed on the border with No.68 Gloucester Road, it would extend to 6m in depth and have a continuous height of approx 3m. Although the parapet wall and rear extension would extend slightly past the side elevation of the original dwelling, it would offer very limited views from the streetscene.\r\rOfficers note an additional rooflight is proposed to the front roof slope which would not appear prominently on the streetscene.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

Therefore the proposed rear extension is unlikely to adversely affect the amenities of the adjoining property.\r\rNo. 72 Gloucester Road also benefits from an existing rear extension.
