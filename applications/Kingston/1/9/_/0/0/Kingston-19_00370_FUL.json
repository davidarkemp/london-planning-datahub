    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rUnlike previous applications which have been refused on lack of evidence demonstrating the need for their removal, this application has provided adequate photographic evidence.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove fell and require replacements for all 4 trees, but smaller mediteranean species in keeping with the stone walled garden and hopefully preventing further maintenance and property damage issues.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat maintenance works.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Tree not protected, application withdrawn.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise.\r\rAssessment:\rThe removal of 2 healthy Lime trees covered by the TPO and without any sound arboricultural reasons is unnaceptable and should be refused.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse \r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rTree not contributing to public amenity so would not be considered for a TPO and on this basis the Council should issue a decision of No Objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo Objection.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rRepeat pollard works as appropriate for health and safety reasons and best practise management.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAcceptable works to reduce and maintain several mature trees some of which are showing signs of diback and stress with deadwood removal and some reductive works needed for health and safety reasons.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Tree not protected, application therefore withdrawn.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor repeat works having no effect on tree health or public amenity to the rear of the properties.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are excessive and not appropriate for the management of the Borch and Hornbeam which are still very young trees. These works will stunt their growth and prevent them from one day providing excellent amenity to this portion of Maple Road. However, despite repeated attempts to communicate with the applicant, the applications is now past its due date for a decision and technically is therefore already permissable.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo Objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 24/09/2021\r\rAssessment:\rThe works including the removal are acceptable and appropriate. A condition should be attached for a replacement planting.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate minor works for the purpose of general maintenance.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works to T.1. T.2 is a Conservation Area tree not covered by the TPO and is in poor condition and declining. It's removal therefore would receive a decision of no objection and could not require replacement by law. As the two are wrapped into one application, the decision should simply be an approval.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works to maintain the tree with no adverse impact upon public amenity or tree health.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works applied for which require application, and are not exempt, are acceptable and minor in nature.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate works for ongoing general management and health and safety.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 24/09/2021.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are acceptable with no harm to public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo Objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rtechnically exempt anyway as it is a hedge not a tree, but the removal of this high Leylandii hedge is to the rear of the property and not affecting public amenity and resolves a potential high hedge application one day being made, so the obvious decision is one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNoobj",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rTree to rear of property and in poor condition not affecting public amenity and therefore the decision should be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objection."
