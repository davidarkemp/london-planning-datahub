    "The application seeks permission to make non material amendment to the interior link section, the amendments comprise the addition of 1 vertical and 1 horizontal mullion to each of the large fixed pane windows in the walkthrough to the new extension.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance notes that there is no statutory definition of \"non material\" and it is dependent on the context of the overall scheme. Under government guidance the local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, what may be non-material in one context may be material in another. The definition of non-material is the responsibility of each local planning authority to determine. The judgement on \"materiality\" in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. Materiality is considered against the development as a whole, not just a part of it. \r\rThe alterations are minor in nature, and would not be visible to public view. \r\rOn this basis it is considered that the proposed modifications taken in combination with any other changes would not be materially different to the approved development. \r\rAccept as non-material amendment under the provisions of Section 96A of the Act \r\r\r",
