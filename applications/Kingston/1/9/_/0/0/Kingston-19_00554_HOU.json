    "The development hereby permitted shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The flat roof(s) of the ground floor extensions hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time be placed in the side elevations of the building/extensions hereby permitted without the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Although the proposed outbuilding would not be set in from the boundary line shared with neighbouring property, No. 29 and 33 Alpine Avenue, it would not be visible within the streetscene and would not be incongruous to the wider area, as neighbouring properties benefit from similar outbuildings. Therefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "It is noted that application ref: 22/01668/CLC was refused for the following reason:\r\r'Due to the insufficient information submitted for Condition 17 (Secured by Design) of planning permission 21/00332/FUL the proposal fails to achieve the principles and objectives of Secured by Design to improve community safety and crime prevention in accordance with Policy CS 14 of Kingston Core Strategy: Safer Communities, Policy DM 22 Design for Safety and Policy SD6  of the London Plan (2021).'\r\rIt is considered that the applicant has now provided sufficient information to demonstrate that design would achieve the principles and objectives of Secured by Design to improve community safety and crime prevention.
