    "The proposed development by virtue of its size and siting would result in a visually intrusive and incongruous addition to the streetscene that would compete with existing street furniture and signage creating street clutter and compete with and detract from the setting of the adjacent statutorily listed Bentalls facade and the character and appearance of the area. The proposal would not accord with section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
