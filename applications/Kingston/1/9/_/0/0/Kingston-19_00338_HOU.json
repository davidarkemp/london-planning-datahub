    "The resultant car parking space facilitated by the crossover would not be of a sufficient size/depth (4.8m) so as to accommodate the safe parking of a motor vehicle, it is likely that any parked vehicle would oversail the pavement thus causing an obstruction to those using the pavement. Therefore, the proposed development does not comply with CS7 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012 and Kingston & Sutton Vehicle Crossover Policy (March 2019).",
    "The proposals will lead to disruption to users of the highway network including the adjacent TfL and SRN in the Borough. As a result, the applicant should contact the Highway Authority at least four month prior to works commencing to obtain TfL Network Assurance approval. This is required under the New Roads and Street Works Act 1991, and the Traffic Management Act 2004, in order to satisfy the licensing requirements of the Highways Act 1980.",
    "Please confirm description of proposed works",
