    "The development was assessed according to the following drawings/details:\r-J003408-DD01\r-J003408-DD02\r-Supporting Letter dated 20th November 2019\r-Email from Peter Brown-john dated 4th February 2020\r",
    "In respect of the archaeological safeguarding conditions, the Written schemes of investigation will need to be prepared and implemented by a suitably qualified professionally accredited archaeological practice in accordance with Historic England's Guidelines for Archaeological Projects in Greater London. This condition is exempt from deemed discharge under schedule 6 of The Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure)(England) Order 2015.\r\rAn archaeological field evaluation involves exploratory fieldwork to determine if significant remains are present on a site and if so to define their character, extent, quality and preservation. Field evaluation may involve one or more techniques depending on the nature of the site and its archaeological potential. It will normally include excavation of trial trenches. A field evaluation report will usually be used to inform a planning decision (pre-determination evaluation) but can also be required by condition to refine a mitigation strategy after permission has been granted.\rAs no desk-based assessment has been undertaken, the Written Scheme of Investigation should include a GLHER search as well as a review of the relevant historic maps in the first instance. This will help to locate potential trial trenches for the archaeological evaluation. Any geotechnical investigations should be archaeologically monitored and/or the data provided to the archaeological organisation who will be undertaking this.\r\rGeoarchaeology is the application of earth science principles and techniques to the understanding of the archaeological record. Coring involves boreholes drilled into the buried deposits to record (and sample) their characteristics, extent and depth. It can assist in identifying buried landforms and deposits of archaeological interest, usually by using the results in deposit models. Coring is often undertaken when the deposits of interest are too deep for conventional digging, or when large areas need to be mapped. It is only rarely used in isolation usually forming part of either\ran archaeological evaluation to inform a planning decision or the excavation of a threatened heritage asset.\r\rDue to the possible presence of alluvial deposits associated with the Hogsmill river and its valley, a geoarchaeological borehole survey may also be required to assess this further as part of the evaluation. The results will be used to confirm an appropriate mitigation strategy as necessary.\r",

A traffic management arrangement for the delivery, erection, dismantling and removal of a tower crane (if it would be used) should be submitted for approval.\r\rThe applicant should be advised to consider if a parking suspension might be needed to allow access for big delivery construction vehicles involved. To apply for parking suspension (if needed), the applicant should contact the Environment Contact Centre on 020 8547 5002.\r\rThe provision of the above information ensures that the Borough and the applicant are able to consider the construction at an early stage. This ensures that construction and any traffic management is completed in a professional and timely manner.\r",
    "Highway Cleaning\r\rShould the access into the site during construction not be paved, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads. We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.\r",
    "Road Condition Survey\r\rIt is highlighted that any proposed works will result in substantial movement of heavy vehicles on the highways, and therefore the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Street Scene Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins.\r\rThis will allow the condition of the carriageway and footway to be monitored, should any damage result from the use of heavy plant associated with this site.\r",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works to maintain historic pleached tree line.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works to reduce and maintain historic pollards, small trees and the removal of a dying conifer for health and safety purposes.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works to reduce a large Oak to the rear of the property by a small amount as appropriate to maintain healthy canopy.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate works to reduce and maintain a large oak in close proximity to the dwelling following the recent loss of the companion Oak due to storm damage and root plate destabilisation.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rA public objection was made to the proposed works on the basis that they would result in taking the well formed crown off and that the works would impact the natural enviroment. The reasoning provided by the applicant for the works was solely in order to gain increased light levels into the parent property offices, however, taking both sides of this into account it became apparent that the works were justified for another reason as the twin leaders bifurcate at almost ground level meaning enormous strees is placed upon this week union. The reduction will therefore be beneficial in reducing wind loading and hopefully failure of the tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works to the three trees, deadwood being exempt and the thid tree being a small specimen and not impacting upon public amenity. This is a Crab Apple and in need of the works which have been applied for to reduce, reshape and restore to good health.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rSmall trees grown poorly, misshapen and causing issues with the building structure. The trees are not worhy of a TPO in their own right or collectively and the Council position should therefore be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objection.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate and acceptable works in order to reduce, reshape and maintain the crown of this significant tree which has grown very misshapen.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rWorks proposed only sought to remove growth toward the flats but did not address the larger issue of the overextended lower lateral limbs weighted heavily over both the nearest adjacent flats and the public footpath and roadway. The tree requires work to reduce the canopy overall to prevent misshapen growth occuring and to reduce wind loading.\r\rRecommendation:\rConsent for lesser or differing works as follows:\r\rT.1 Cedar - Removal of 2 lowest primary limbs one on East side reaching toward flats and one on West side oversailing the road. 2m Holistic reduction of remaining crown to suitable growth points whilst retaining natural crown shape, remove brash pile from base & deadwood.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works to alter canopy to accomodate new adjacent building as the two are currently in conflict since the pollard regrowth is impacting upon the building.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rA recommendation was receieved by the Arb Consultant for removal on the basis of suspected root plate movement and heavy developing lean in losse embankment soil behind a low quality retaining wall following the failure of the tree next to it. Photos likewise have been provided by the applicant demonstrating the situation. As such the removal is appropriate and the requirement for a replacement tree for both those removed will be waived in this instance due to the embankment not being suitable for further planting at this time.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate works to mitigate health and safety risks and to reduce ad maintain the large trees in the communal areas serving this residential cul-de-sac.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor appropriate works to lift encroaching crown for access to properties and road serving them.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor works to a small tree at the rear of the property and not contributing to public amenity. The default Council decision should therefore be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAs demonstrated by supporting photos, both trees are almost dead. The Yew is the only one of the two covered by the TPO which means that this requires replacement but the second tree does not as it is only protected by the Conservation Area.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove with condition for replacement planting.",
    "The trees in question are not protected and following discussion with the Agent it was agreed that the application would be withdrawn.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate works to reduce pollard regrowth for the health of the tree and for the safety of the public.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAs evidenced in the supporting photos included within the submission, the tree is in terminal decline and it's removal is sensible and will allow room for the further growth of the two adjacent trees.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
