    "As an application to make a non-material amendment is not an application for planning permission, the existing Town and Country Planning (Development Management Procedure) (England) Order 2015 provisions relating to statutory consultation and publicity do not apply. \r\rNotwithstanding the Council has received numerous objections to the application.\r\rSection 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the Act) allows a non-material amendment to be made to an existing planning permission via a simple application procedure with a quick decision time. \r\rSection 96A of the Act states that \"A local planning authority in England may make a change to any planning permission relating to land in their area if they are satisfied that the change is not material.\"\r\rIn deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe power conferred by Section 96A would allow the Council:\r\r(a)\tto impose new conditions; \r(b)\tto remove or alter existing conditions.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance  provides guidance on non-material amendments.\r\rThe NPPG directs \"There is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another.\" \r\rThe focus of the assessment of an application for a non-material amendment is whether the proposed amendment, taken individually or cumulatively with any other previously approved non-material amendment, and in the context or the previously approved development, is non-material or not.\r\rApplication reference 20/01125/NMA seeks to alter / amend Condition 5 of Planning Permission 20/00378/FUL.\r\rCondition 5 of planning permission 20/01125/NMA operates to prevent works which are audible at the site boundary outside of the hours of 08.00 and 18.00 Mondays to Fridays and between 08.00 and 13.00 on Saturdays and not at all on Bank Holidays and Sundays.\r\rApplication reference 20/01125/NMA seeks to extend the construction hours for a period of 1 calendar month from 08.00 until 21.00 Monday to Saturday. \r\rIn assessing the application Officers are fully aware of the Written Ministerial Statement (WMS) issued by the Secretary of State at the Ministry of Housing, Communities, and Local Government in relation to extending construction hours. Moreover, Officers are acutely aware of the economic benefits delivered by the construction industry; the benefits of delivering homes quickly, especially at a time when the Council is not able to demonstrate a 5 year supply of housing land; and, by extending hours the ability of the developer to better adhere to Public Health England guidance in terms of social distancing on site. However, an application submitted under Section 96A is not one whereby Officers are able to weigh any merits of the proposal against any demerits, instead it is an assessment of whether the proposed amendment is non-material or not.\r\rAs identified in the NPPG the assessment of whether a proposed amendment is non-material will in part be dependent on the context of the overall scheme and the location in which the development is situated. Indeed, an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another.\r\rIn the case of the current application, the application site is in a densely populated area, neighbours a number of residential properties, and is in close proximity to a Rehabilitation / Care Home facility, a sensitive use with sensitive users.\r\rTaking into account the context of the application site, Officers consider that an amendment to Condition 5, to facilitate longer construction hours, could have an unreasonable impact on the residents of the surrounding roads, in particular the Rehabilitation / Care Home facility. \r\rThe applicant has submitted a statement on suggested mitigation. The mitigation promoted by the applicant focuses on adherence to the approved Construction Management Plan (CMP). However, no alterations / amendments are proposed to the CMP to accommodate / address working later into the evenings. \r\rTaking into account the limited mitigation package proposed by the applicant along with the context of the site, a site in a densely populated area in close proximity to a Rehabilitation / Care Home facility, Officers conclude that the amendment would be greater than non-material and as such conclude that the application should be refused. \r\rIn arriving at this decision Officers are cognisant of the importance of the construction industry and the vital role it plays in the local / regional economy. Moreover, Officers acknowledge the WMS of the Secretary of State, and agree with him that in the right circumstances, at the right site, an extension to construction hours should be approved. However, for the reasons cited above, in this instance, Officers consider that the application should be refused.\r\rThis decision should not be interpreted as a position statement on how the WMS will be applied across the Borough. Each application will be dealt with on its own merits.\r\rPlease note working beyond the construction hours set out in Condition 5 of Planning Permission 20/00378/FUL might constitute a breach of planning control.\r",
