    "The proposed advertisement display by virtue of its size, siting and design would be visually intrusive creating an incongruous addition to the streetscene detracting from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and compete with and detract from the setting of the adjacent statutorily listed Bentalls facade. The proposal would not accord with section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r",
    "Representations: 4 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals. No responses have been received.",
    "Please note that the quality of advice will be proportionate to the level of information provided, therefore it is to the applicants benefit to provide as much supporting information as possible for the proposal. eg: plans and elevations, photographs and supporting documents.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe removal of both small trees is at the rear of the property, where the trees are causing damage to a boundary wall and are not visible to the public so not contributing to public amenity or therefore worthy of a TPO. The COuncil decision should therefore be one of No objection by default.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
