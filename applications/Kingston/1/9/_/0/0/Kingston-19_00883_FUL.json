    "The site comprises a two-storey detached dwelling located on the southside of Woodside Road, which is a well-established residential area. The properties are characterised by a narrow width and are separated by a passageway to the side of each property. There are examples of single storey rear extensions at neighbouring properties, though not any examples of first floor additions. The property is not listed, nor is it within a conservation area though it is within a Local Area of Special Character. The property is also within flood zone 2, as defined by the Environment Agency, and so is at a medium risk of flooding. Ground levels appear consistent with the neighbouring properties.\r\r8 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and three letters of objection were received following the consultation period. The planning issues raised are:\r- Excessive height or bulk\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use\r- Car parking issues\r- Loss of trees\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; \r- The impact of the development on the risk of flooding in and around the site; and\r- Other issues raised by the consultation responses. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal will involve the demolition of a single storey rear extension at the rear of the property. It is not considered that it possesses any significant architectural merit and so there is no objection to its loss. The proposal will involve the erection of a part-two, part-single storey extension. The proposed ground floor aspect will project 4.5m from the rear of the property, a net increase of 2.5m from the original footprint of the property, and a 2m projection at first floor level. The size of the resultant extension would be in keeping with the scale of the original property. Due to the built up nature of the area, the proposal would not be readily visible from any public viewpoint, though the use of appropriate materials would ensure that there is no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\rThe proposal would increase the footprint of the property and therefore reduce the amount of amenity space available. However, given the depth of the rear garden, adequate space would be retained for residents to enjoy and undertake their day-to-day activities. Due to the passageways either side of the property, the extension would be set in from each of the side boundaries which will ensure that there is no dominating impact from the extension. Due to the orientation of the properties, there may be some loss of sunlight to the neighbour at no. 23, however any loss would be for a short period of time first thing in the morning. The ground floor aspect of the extension would have a flat roof that could be accessed from first floor and used as an outdoor seating area/balcony. A condition can be imposed to prevent such use to ensure that neighbouring properties do not suffer from increased noise disturbance or overlooking. Consequently, it is considered that acceptable levels of residential amenity would be maintained for both occupants of the property and their neighbours. \r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rConcern has been raised that the increased size of the property would result in further demand for on-street parking. The property would remain as one single dwelling and the extension is modest in size so it would not result in undue pressure for on street parking space. There are also no trees of high amenity value that would be affected by the proposal.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed extension would be in scale and character with the host property and would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. Residential amenity would not be compromised and there are no concerns that the proposal would increase the risk of flooding in and around the site. In conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The proposed erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 2no. rooflights to front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class B & Class C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Car and cycle parking.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note similar permissions have been granted at No. 51 & No. 55 Cambridge Avenue. Officers acknowledge that the lack of set back from the front elevation is not fully compliant with policy 36 of the Residential Design SPD but consider it acceptable due to the prevailing pattern of development in the street, where numerous side extensions have not been set back. A characteristic gap between properties has been maintained between No. 51 and No. 53 Cambridge Avenue.  The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the standards set out in Policy T6.1 and Table 10.1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3. Despite the loss of the garage and potential cycle storage therein, the application property and garden is of an adequate size to accommodate dedicated and secure cycle storage and access from the front of the property to the rear would be retained.  Therefore, the proposal is considered to achieve general compliance with Policy T5.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-deatched dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design at the side at first floor. It is considered that the proposed first floor side extension would be an incongruous addition to the host property. It is considered its proportions would appear 'squat' and 'stark' and would jar with the overall character and appearance of the host property and unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties the host property forms part of and as a result would be visually intrusive in the streetscene.  It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy (delete as appropriate).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
