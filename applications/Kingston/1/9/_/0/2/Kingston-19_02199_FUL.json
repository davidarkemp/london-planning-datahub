    "This consent shall be for a temporary period of 3 years beginning with the date on this Decision Notice.  At the expiration of 3 years any use shall cease and the building shall be removed from the site. The site shall be restored in accordance with a restoration/landscape plan which shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority 3 months before the expiration of the permission.\r\rReason: The proposed building would not make full use of this site, which it is anticipated would be developed as part of a comprehensive development within the North Kingston Development Brief area in accordance with Council policies CS8 (Character, Design and Heritage) and DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Within 2 months of the date of this decision, the existing vehicular access to the site will be stopped up with the existing crossover reinstated and prevented from beneficial use, in accordance with the details set out in approved plan U065/02/001/006 Rev A (Proposed Landscape Plan) and the measures shall be permanently retained to prevent the access for vehicles from the public highway  onto the site.\r\rReason: In the interests of highway safety in accordance with Policy DM09 (Managing Vehicle Use for New Development) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r\r",
    "The development shall not be used until a hard and soft landscaping scheme shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.  The approved scheme shall be implemented prior to use of the building and the area shown to be landscaped shall be maintained for that purpose only until the expiration of this permission.  Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season. \r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policies DM6 (Biodiversity) and DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The site comprises two semi-detached dwellings.\r\r19 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front porch extensions are considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rGiven that the hip-to-gable roof extensions with rear dormer roof extensions will maintain a balanced roofscape for both semi-detached properties, and as such it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed first floor rear extensions wouldn't be set in from the shared boundary, given that they would be a modest scale, and propose appropriate roof forms, officers consider they would appear proportionate and appropriate additions to both host properties. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rOfficers note that new openings would be proposed at the side elevations at first floor level, as such to mitigate against any loss of privacy for neighbouring properties, officers consider a condition can be imposed to ensure that they are obscure glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels.  In this case, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Only existing and proposed plans and elevations can be accepted. \r\rPlease remove all outlines and annotation referring to previous applications on proposed drawings.\r\rThere is also an error with the drawing numbers submitted on 29/05/22 . \r\rPlease correct and resubmit all proposed plans and elevations\r",
    "Please ensure all submitted floor plans and elevations show a scale bar/and/or metric measurements on the plans",
    "The site address in the submitted application form is 1A Grand Parade, Ewell Road, whereas the redoutline and the description of the proposal shows the land rear to 1A Grand Parade. Please amend the application form with the correct site address. Please find the attached application form."
