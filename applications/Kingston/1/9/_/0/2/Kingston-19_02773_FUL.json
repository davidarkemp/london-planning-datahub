    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a part two/part three storey building comprising a mixture of residential and light commercial use. This application relates specifically to the second floor flat known as 5A Chancery House.\r\rThe site is located within a mixed residential/commercial use area and in the Tolworth Key Area of change and subject to an Article 4 Direction that removes permitted development rights for change of use from commercial, business and service use (Use Class E) to residential use (Use Class C3).\r\rProposal\rPlanning permission is sought for the installation of 6 nos side rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration to rear windows.\r\rThe internal loft space is existing and would accommodate a bedroom and ensuite to Flat 5A. The flat would remain a one bedroom but would extend over two floors instead of one as existing.\r\rThe proposal would not result in any loss of commercial space.\r\rConsultations\r64 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, and;\r- Fire Safety.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed loft conversion comprises the installation of 6 x side roof lights (4 on one side and 2 on the other side elevation), and 2 x circular rooflights to the front and rear elevations. No objection is raised to the external design and appearance of the building.\r\rIt is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character or appearance of the main dwelling and immediate surrounding area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rGiven the siting and nature of the proposed works and that there would be no increase in the intensity of use, it is not considered there would be any adverse impacts on the amenities of neighbouring occupants.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFire Safety\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site is a former commercial site on Kingston Hill situated to the rear of a run of properties west of Queens Road and accessed via a vehicle access between 53 and 55 Kingston Hill situated opposite the Kingston Hospital grounds.\r\rThe area is mixed in use and the site is located in the designated heritage asset the Liverpool Road Conservation Area. The buildings and curtilage on or adjacent the site are not litsed.\r\rProposal \r\rA section 73 application is sought to vary plans condition 2 of planning permission 16/13202/FUL to make a minor change to the approved floor levels. \r\rThe overall building would still be 9.31m to the ridge with a small change proposed to the floor to ceiling heights a decrease of 25mm at ground and first floor level to maintain the approved building height. \r\rIt should be noted that the description of development erroneously stated site level changes were sought. However the applicant has confirmed that changes to the site levels are not sought and this reference to site levels has been omitted from the original description of development.\r\rConsultation\r\r3 objections have been received. The objections are summarised as follows \r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r\rOfficer comment: The objections are addressed in the officers assessment.\r\rOne objection in particular raises points of concern to particular elements of the submission and are lifted from the objection below and an officer response provided. \r\rObjection - It is an incomplete submission - the updated plans do not include a rear elevation drawing, so the\rimpact of the retrospective change cannot be compared to the original drawing: 16_ 13202_FUL-\rPROPOSED_CROSS_SECTION_AND_REAR_ELEVATION-3  \r\rOfficer response. On consultation with the applicant they have responded that the levels to the rear are the same as those to the front. . The site is entirely flat as it consists of made ground hence levels are consistent throughout. Site levels are indicated on plan P010-P01-R1. \r\rOfficers are satisfied that the levels on the topography survey accompanying the original permission have not changed as shown in the application under consideration and the applicant has confirmed they are not seeking to change the site levels. References to site levels is erroneous in the description of development and has been amended to remove this.\r\robjection - Section 2.7 of PLANNING_STATEMENT-4564003, includes approved and proposed heights that\rare not comparable, specifically Level 03 (to ridge) being compared to Level 03 (to ceiling).\r\rOfficer response. On consultation with the applicant they have responded that the overall height of the building is identical to the planning permission. i.e. 9310 above finished ground level. The internal floor to ceiling levels are 3075mm on the built drawings whereas the floor-to floor levels on the approved MAA drawings are 3100mm. 3100mm is not buildable as it does not course to brickwork, hence we have reduced to 3075mm which does course. The 25mm difference is the sole purpose of the S73 application for minor material amendment which we have discussed at length. The internal floor-to-floor heights have no impact to anyone other than the occupant and are in fact lower than the approved drawings. \r\rOfficers accept this reasoning and are satisfied that the only change is the floor to ceiling heights and assessment of this change is made in the officers assessment.\r\rObjection - The revised drawing: P-200_PROPOSED_CROSS_SECTION___FRONT _ELEVATION-\r4566070 is incorrect - the reality is that the development ground level is higher (and will be even\rhigher once finished) to the ground level of the rear gardens of 3 & 5 & 7 Queens Road. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that All levels on site are unchanged from before as indicated on our drawing PA010-P01-R1 and are unchanged from existing. All stipulations of the planning approval have been complied with. \r\rOfficers are satisfied that this is the case that the only change sought is to the floor to ceiling heights.\r\rObjection - Plans need to be submitted that accurately reflect the elevations with respect to the surrounding properties and section 2.7 to be updated. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that The drawings submitted are entirely accurate, entirely as-built, and entirely in accordance with the planning permission. \r\rOfficers are satisfied that this is the case.\r\rObjection These concerns remain outstanding:\r1. Garden Elevation - Water Drainage\rThe elevated gardens will result in the risk of water flowing away to the surrounding properties of at least 3,5 & 7 and 9 Queens Road in the event of heavy rain. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that The entire site is sustainably drained using soakaways. There is no evidence of any flooding of surrounding properties which are generally higher than our development. The substrata is completely porous made ground and has passed percolation tests carried out on site to confirm this. \r\rOfficers are satisfied with this response and are not revisiting these matters as the application relates solely to a change to a floor to ceiling height internally. \r\rObjection 2. Garden Elevation - Privacy\rThe elevated garden will reduce privacy for surrounding properties. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that The buildings are constructed entirely in accordance with the approved planning drawings. This allows for privacy screens etc. There are no privacy issues other than what would normally be expected in an urban development of this type. \r\rOfficers are satisfied with this response and have addressed matters of amenity in the assessment and the change in floor to ceiling height is not considered to impact on the privacy of neighbours\r\r\rObjection 3. Overall Building Height\rThe overall building height in relation to the surrounding properties willi be higher than what has been approved in the plans. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that The building is identical to the approved building plans and at 9310mm above Ground Level is the same height as the planning permission. \r\rOfficers are satisfied with this response and are satisfied that no change in site levels is proposed and that the building height above finished ground level would not be different to the approved scheme.\r\r\rObjection It's noted that:\ra The height of this development was approved to be below the height of the properties on the Queens Road side and those of the two 3 storey houses at The Farthings, thus reducing the dominant impact this build will have on the existing neighbours. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that The building is identical to the approved building plans and at 9310mm above Ground Level is the same height as the planning permission. There is no change whatsoever to the existing site levels. \r\rOfficers are satisfied with this response and are satisfied that there is no change in the site levels.\r\r \rObjection b The concern is that if the ground level is higher than the plans, the overall building height will be above those of the surrounding properties which has been explicitly referenced in the approved plans and will result in a 'Dominant Impact' on the surrounding properties. \r\rOfficer comment: On consultation with the applicant they have responded that The building is identical to the approved building plans and at 9310mm above Ground Level is the same height as the planning permission. The ground level is identical now to what it was before work commenced as indicated on drawing P010-P01-R1. \r\rOfficers are satisfied with this response and are satisfied that there is no change in levels sought. \r\rKingston CAAC: no objection\r\rAssessment\r\rThe proposed change in levels does not compromise the internal space standards of the approved building or the quantum or mix of units approved. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. The change in levels relates to a change to the internal floor to ceiling heights which shows a reduction of 25mm at ground and first floor to maintain the overall approved height 9.31m. It is considered that this minor change would not be readily obvious and is a subordinate change and would not change the overall character and appearance of the proposed development. The proposed change would not cause harm to the designated heritage asset the Liverpool Conservation Area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The height of the building does not increase with the minor change proposed. The change is a reduction in floor to ceiling height at ground and first floor to maintain the overall approved height of the building and as such it is considerd that this would not change the approved buildings relationship with the neighbouring properties and their occupiers. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "The application is for installation of heat pump, whereas the proposed floor plans and elevations show the rear extension in the main house. The description needs to include these extension. Please clarify.\rIf you do not want to include the rear extension in the description of this application, please do not show these extension in the proposed drawings which have been approved in the previous application.\r\rPlease revise the proposed floor plans and elevations accordingly.",
    "The fee required for your planning application is £924.  Payment can be made via either our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002, or online via the Kingston council website.",
    "Inconsistent drawings - Please check the dimensions of the Proposed Side Elevation and Roof Plans which show the depth of the proposed extension measuring approximately 3.2m, when the Proposed Floor Plan measures 3.5m in line with the proposed dimentsions. Please amend and re-submit these drawings.",
    "Scale Bar Incorrect - the 1:1250 scale bar on the re-submitted Site Location Plan (Plan 001) still does not measure correctly. It measures 87m, when the stated measurement is 70m. Please correct this scale bar so that it can used to scale correctly.",
    "The Site Location Plan should include land necessary to carry out the proposed development, e.g. land required for access to the site from a public highway. Please amend the red line site polygon to include access to the highway.",
    "The scale bars and annotated measurements on the Shed 1 and Shed 2 Plans are not correct. The scale bars measure 5m, not 10m, at the stated scale of 1:50. Also, the annotated measurements on the drawings are incorrect. Please check all measurements and amend the plans so that they can be assessed using the correct scale."
