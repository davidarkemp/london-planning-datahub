    "Please provide approved plans of Planning Permission 19/01202/HOU at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire property not just part and showing dimensions of proposed work.\r",
    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe Walnut to the rear is not covered by the TPO but is within the Conservation Area. It is not visible to the public so it would receive a decision of No Objection under a section 211 Notification and should be treated the same within this TPO application. The Council are also unable to require a replacement for it's removal. The Maple at the front though is covered by the TPO and while it's removal is acceptable of the grounds that it is dying (has severe crown dieback visible in google stree view photos for the last few years getting progressively worse), it should be replaced by a good specimen tree.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove with requirement to replant as replacement for the Acer."
