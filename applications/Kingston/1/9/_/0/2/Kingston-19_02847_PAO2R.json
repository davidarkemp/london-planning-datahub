    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the residential units the applicant shall submit a Car Park Management Plan demonstrating how any future occupants of the residential units hereby approved will be prevented from applying for both residential and visitor parking permits for parking within the Controlled Parking Zone surrounding the application site. The management plan shall include a completed unilateral undertaking under Section 16 of the Greater London Council (General Powers) Act 1974. The units shall not be occupied until the Car Parking Management Plan is approved.\r\rReason : In the interest of highway safety, the surrounding roads have insufficient capacity to accommodate any further parking, and also in the interest of encouraging the uptake of sustainable modes of transport. \r\r",

This letter does not constitute a new planning permission. The development should be built in full accordance with the original planning permission except where amended by this decision.",
