    "The proposed dwellinghouse by reason of its position on the site and its design and proposed materials would be out of character with the streetscene and surrounding area. The proposal fails to comply with Policy 3.5 of the London Plan and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed dwellinghouse by reason of its proximity to No.58 Arundle Road and No.66 Kenley Road would result in a harmful increase in a sense of enclosure to these neighbouring properties and furthermore would result in a  loss of privacy for occupiers of No.58 Arundle Road. Therefore, the proposal fails to comply with Policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. The site sits within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character and The Drive Local Area of Special Character.\r\r11 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been made relating to access or traffic problems caused by construction. Officers consider in the event of an approval, a construction management plan can be conditioned to ensure that construction is managed effectively. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed roof extensions would partially fill in the pitched roof to create gable ends, resulting in a rather unusual sloped roof form that would appear bulky, and out of keeping with the host property. Officers consider that the contrast of timber cladding with brick cladding and slate at roof level would enhance the visual appearance of this partial pitched roof with gable ends, and given the mix of materials, unusual roof form and substantial increase in glazing at ground level, would create a disorderly appearance on the front elevation. As such, officers consider the proposed roof extensions to appear an inappropriate addition to the host property. Also given that the proposed extensions would sit within a group of houses, and that the proposal would create a distinct visual separation between these dwellings, officers consider that the proposal would appear an incongruous addition to the immediate surrounding area.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed single storey side/rear extension would exceed the parameters of the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth and height, and while officers consider the depth to be appropriate given that the property sits within a substantial plot, given the excessive height combined with the proposed flat roofs and use of slate and concrete, the proposal would appear visually prominent from the side and front elevations and would detract from the character of the original dwelling. Given that these materials are not prominently used within the immediate surrounding area officers consider the proposal would appear visually incongruous and would detract from the appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Although the proposal would not adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, given the separation distance between the proposed extensions and surrounding property, as well as the extensive tree coverage on the boundary of the site, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would significantly alter the character of the original dwelling, and the proposed extensions would appear out of scale and out of keeping with the host property. As such, officers consider that the proposed extension would appear an incongruous addition within the surrounding area and would detract from the character and appearance of the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character as well as The Drive Local Area of Special Character, thereby resulting in less than substantial harm.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to move the front wall of the proposed side extension forward in line with the portico, raise the floors levels of the side and rear extensions in line with existing floor levels, and amend the roof of the rear extension from mono-pitched to flat. Officers are satisfied that these changes would not have any material impact on the character and appearance of the area or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. Accordingly, the changes are considered to be non-material.",
