    "The Council considers the amendments to be non-material and as such, it is recommended that the S96A application for a non-material amendment to be granted.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located in the critical drainage area.\r\rRepresentations:\r5 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  One letter has been received regarding the following summarised concerns:\r-\tInappropriate design \r-\tConcerns about the shared drain\r-\tImpact on the garage foundation of the adjoin property when conducting piling works for the new extension.\r\rOfficer comment: Concerns in relation to the shared drain and foundations are governed by Building regulations and do not constitue material planning considerations in this application.  \r\rThe remaining issues are considered below. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The adjoining property No. 7 Orme Road benefits from the rear extension and the proposed development would match the extension in depth. With regards to No. 3 Orme Road, the extension would be set in by approx. 2.5m from the shared boundary. It is noted that the proposed toilet window on the flank elevation would be obscured glazed and non-openable above 1.7m from the floor level.  Given the above and the modest scale and sitting of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
