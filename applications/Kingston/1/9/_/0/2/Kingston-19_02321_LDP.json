    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015. \r \rInformative:   \rThe height of the eaves of the part of the dwellinghouse enlarged, improved or altered must not exceed the height of the eaves of the existing dwellinghouse\rThe materials used in any exterior work shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. The materials used for facing a dormer should appear to be of similar colour and design to the materials used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level\r",
    "Condition A.4. (7) of the (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 states that where an owner or occupier of any adjoining premises objects to the proposed development, the local planning authority is required to assess the amenity impact of the proposed development on those adjoining premises.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed extension would have limited impact on the amneity of No. 58 Robin Hood Lane. With regards to No. 4 Ullswater, whilst the proposed extension would fail the 45 degree rule on plan view, it would pass on elevation view and thereby meet BRE guidelines and would provide a good standard of amenity.",
    "Please provide a revised copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rMinor repeat works with no adverse impact upon tree health or amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
