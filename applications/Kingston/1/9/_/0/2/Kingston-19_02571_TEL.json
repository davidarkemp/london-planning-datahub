    "The proposed telecoms equipment by virtue of its siting and appearance would create an incongruous addition to the host property and streetscene that would be visually intrusive, creating visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the Riverside South Conservation. Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Builds and Conservation Area) Act 1990, paragraphs 189 - 196 of the NPPF and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012",
    "Highway Cleaning\rShould the access into the site during construction not be paved, spoil could be carried from the site onto the public highway. The access into the site should be paved to minimise the carryover of spoil onto adjacent roads. We would also require the applicant to sweep and wash down the adjacent roads to ensure that the public highway is kept clear of debris. This is to ensure a satisfactory road surface for road safety reasons at all times.\r",
    "Please provide existing and proposed dropped kerb plans at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing the outline of entire property and all key dimensions for the proposed works."
