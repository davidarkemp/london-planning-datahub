    "The proposed development would increase the density of both the built development and residential use of the site to an unacceptable degree. The proposal would result in the over-development of the site, and would have a harmful effect to character and appearance of the surrounding area. This would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed dwelling would result in a significantly substandard form of accommodation for future occupants, by virtue of its gross internal area and poor outlook. The proposed external amenity space would measure 19 square metres and would fail to provide future occupants with a reasonable degree of privacy. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "By virtue of its siting, size and height, the proposed dwelling would have an adverse impact on the residential amenities of the owner/occupiers of the bungalow at No,166a King Charles Road, in terms of loss of outlook and overbearing impact. The proposal would therefore not provide a good standard of amenity for existing occupants at the site. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate how parking arrangements for all the existing and future owner/occupiers of dwellings on the site could be accommodated. The applicant has failed to demonstrate that there would be sufficient on street car parking capacity to accommodate overspill parking from the proposed development. The applicant has therefore failed to demonstrate that the proposal would not have any significant adverse impact on  the demand for street parking, local traffic conditions and highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the NPPF (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan  (2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "When undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.",
    "Section 59 of the Highways Act permits the Highway Authority to charge developers for damage caused by excessive weight and movements of vehicles to and from a site. The Highway Authority will pass on the cost of any excess repairs compared to normal maintenance costs to the applicant/organisation responsible for the damage.",
    "The developer is reminded that it is an offence to allow materials to be carried from the site and deposited on or damage the highway from uncleaned wheels or badly loaded vehicles. The Highway Authority will seek, wherever possible, to recover any expenses incurred in clearing, cleaning or repairing highway surfaces and prosecute persistent offenders. (Highways Act 1980 Sections 131, 148, 149).",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rEighteen neighbouring properties have been notifed and no representation shave been received.\r\rRBK Highways engineer  - No objection.\r\rThis application follows the recent refusal of application 20/00195/HOU on 24/03/2020. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Loss of garage/parking\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 2 off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
