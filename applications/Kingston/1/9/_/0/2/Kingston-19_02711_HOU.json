    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its poor design which includes; the absence of a 1.0m set in from the west boundary; the absence of a 0.5m setback from the front elevation; the absence of a 0.5m dropped roofline and the proposed width which is greater than 50% of the width of the main dwelling; would be a disproportionate addition which would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would unbalance the character of the main dwelling and would be at odds with the streetscene of Lower Marsh Lane. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed roof re-design by way of its inappropriate roof form; would appear as a visually incongruous form of development which would unbalance the row of housing in which it would rest and would be at odds with the streetscene of Lower Marsh Lane. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed two storey rear extension by way of its inappropriate flat roof form; would appear as an incongruous feature when measured against the design of the main dwelling. It is considered the proposed two storey rear extension with a flat roof would be at odds with the character of the main dwelling. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension by reason of its detailed design which includes: the absence of a 0.5m set down from the ridge and the absence of a 0.5m set in from the side and eaves of the main dwelling; and its overall bulk; would fail to appear proportionate or subordinate to the original property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r",
    "Important details such as; height, finish, roof design/form and elevational detailing have not been provided as part of this application. In the absence of these details, the LPA is unable to fully evaluate the proposed single storey rear extension as outlined on the proposed ground floor plan against the requisite policies within the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Taking into account the context of the area and the exisitng development, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officer Comment: The proposed first floor extension would have a flat roof, which would relate poorly to the host property and the effect of this would be exacerbated by the fact that it would extend across the entire width of the rear elevation. The proposed development is therefore considered unacceptable in terms of scale and form. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed extensions would extend 6m beyond the rear building line of 19 Cranborne Avenue at ground floor level and approximately 2m at first floor level. The structure would also be set hard up against the boundary shared with this property. Although it is recognised that the depth of the first floor element has been limited such that it would pass the 45 degree test in plan, when also taking into account the ground floor element the structure overall would fail the test in both plan and elevation in respect of the nearest ground floor window. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of 19 Cranborne Avenue by reason of overbearing appearance and loss of light.",
