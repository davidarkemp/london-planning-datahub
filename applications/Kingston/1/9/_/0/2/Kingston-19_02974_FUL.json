    "The development hereby permitted shall be begun before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall not be sited on the pavement outside of the hours of 07.00- 24.00 Monday to Sunday and on Bank Holidays, unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of neighbouring residential occupiers in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extension) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "The site comprises a two-storey detached dwelling located on the south side of Durlston Road, which is a well-established residential area. To the rear of the property is a pitched roof conservatory that spans the full width of the property and does not appear to be an original feature. To the side is a covered passageway that is adjacent to the boundary with No. 4a Durlston Road, which is a lightweight timber structure. Immediately adjacent to the boundary No. 4a has a single storey extension and there is a first floor window that faces the site. No. 8 Durlston has a single storey, monopitch extension adjacent to the boundary between the properties, and the remainder of the side boundary comprises a typical domestic wooden fence and vegetation, which provides a good level of screening between the two properties. The property has a rear garden depth of approximately 25m, is located within Flood Risk Zone 1 and not within a locally defined critical drainage area. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal involves the demolition of a conservatory at the rear of the property, which does not appear to be an original feature of the property. It is considered that it does not have any significant architectural merit and so there is no objection to its loss. The proposed rear extension would span the full width of the property and project 4m from the rear elevation. It would have a pitched roof finish with ridge height of 3.8m and eaves of 2.7m. These dimensions are considered acceptable and the proposed rear extension would be in scale and character with the original property and would not unduly dominate the space available within the site curtilage.\r\rTo the side of the property, a proposed single storey extension would replace an existing lightweight timber/perspex structure that creates a covered passageway. Again, this structrue is considered not to make a positive impact upon the appearance of the property and so there is no objection to its loss. The proposed extension would be set back from the front elevation of the property and its dimensions would ensure that it appears as a subordinate feature within the elevation of the property. Cumulatively, the proposed works would be in scale and character with the original property. Subject to the use of appropriate conditions, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area as a result of the development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposal will increase the footprint of the property, thereby reducing the amount of amenity space at the rear. Given that the property has a garden depth of approximately 25m, then adequate space would remain for residents to enjoy without their amenity being compromised. As the rear extension would be set in from the side boundaries with neighbouring properties and given its height and roof design, it would not unduly dominate the amenity area of these neighbours. The neighbouring property at No. 4a Durlston Road already has a single storey side extension in place and whilst there is a window within the side elevation that faces the application site, it is considered that the outlook from this property would not be comrpomised by the presence of the proposed side extension.\r\rIn conclusion, it is considered that the proposed development would be in scale and character of the original property and would not have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area. Adequate amenity space would remain for occupants of the property to enjoy, and there would be no adverse impact upon the living conditions of the residents of neighbouring properties. Consequently, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
