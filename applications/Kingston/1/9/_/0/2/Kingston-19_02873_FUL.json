    "The materials and finishes of the external walls and roof of the development hereby permitted shall match in colour and texture those of the existing building, or such other materials as shall have been approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority and shall thereafter be retained as such. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to occupation details of the proposed species related to the living roof and their associated irrigation systems and maintenance shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The approved works shall be carried out in the first planting season following the completion of the development.  Any planting which within a period of five years from the completion of the development die, are removed, or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of similar size and species.  The living roof shall be permanently retained for that purpose only and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To ensure that these works are properly implemented and maintained and in the interest of visual amenity in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The flat roofs of the extensions hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as balconies or sitting out areas, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development shall be completed in accordance with the following details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, before building operations commence.  \r\r(a)\tboundary treatment, (including manufacturer(s) specification, dimensions, colour and texture of walls, fences and gates).\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990.  (As amended)\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The loss of the garage and impact on parking / cycling.\r\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension and garage conversion, including alterations to the roof of the existing garage, increasing its height from 2.7m to 3.25m.\r\rThe single storey extension would project from the rear of the house by approx 5.3m (the existing conservatory would be demolished), would span the width of the property, and would connect to the existing single storey garage with alterations to the roof of the garage consisting of a increase in height by 0.5m. The extension would be finished in materials to match the existing house. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst not in strict accordance with the SPD, the proposal would nonetheless be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposal would see the loss of the garage as a storage space, including for the storage of cycles. The removal of space available for the safe and secure storage of cycles is contrary to policies seeking the provision of infrastructure to support the use of sustainable modes of transport (in this case cycles) and as such reduce reliance on the private motor vehicle. It is concluded that sufficient space exists at the side of the property to provide cycle storage facilities and a condition requiring this to be provided is included.\r\rIn terms of space for the parking of motor vehicles, it is considered that sufficient space would remain at the property to accommodate parking.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The details submitted for Condition 4 Part (ii) (Window details and reveals) of planning permission ref 19/01207/FUL by the applicant are considered satisfactory. As such, Condition 4 Part (ii) is hereby fully approved.",
    "The Council's Design Officer raised no objections to the submitted information.\r",
    "The assessment of this application has been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information /drawings. If you carry out development based on incorrect plans you may be liable to the Council taking enforcement action against you.",
    "The site comprises a first floor flat of an end of terrace dwelling.\r\rThirteen neighbouring propoerties have been notified and 3 objections have been submitted raising the following summarised concerns;\r- Loss of light/sunlight;\r- Noise;\r- Privacy;\r- Unacceptable or incompatible use;\r- Car park issues; and,\r- Inappropriate design/layout.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on parking.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note similar permissions for dormer roof extensions have been granted at Nos. 12, 24 and 48 Windmill Rise. Therefore, the proposed development would not be out of character with surrounding development and due to its proportionate and subordinate nature is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. There would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to its subordinate and proportionate nature the proposed dormer window would not be unduly obtrusive when viewed from neighbouring properties or have an adverse impact on loss of light, outlook or privacy. Any views afforded over into neighbouring gardens would be similar to those gained from the existing first floor windows in the rear elevation. The Council's residential design SPD requires a minimum of 21 metres separation between facing habitable room windows. Officers note the the nearest habitable windows facing the dormer would be those on the side elevation of 29 Haygreen Close which are approximatly 26 metres away. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the extension of the existing 1 bedroom flat to provide 1 additional bedroom, a shower room and an office would not result in a significant intensification of the existing use, or result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon highway safety. The existing car parking arrangements are considered to be adequate and in compliance with the standards set out in the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
