    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension by reason of its poor design which includes; inadequate front elevation detailing; the absence of an adequate set in from the west boundary and an excessive 4.3m rearward projection; would appear as a contrived and disproportionate addition which would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would be at odds with the character of the main dwelling and the character and appearance of Tudor Estate LASC. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its poor design and position; would appear to be a disproportionate and insubordinate addition which would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would be at odds with the character of the main dwelling and the character and appearance of Tudor Estate LASC. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by reason of its excessive 4.0m depth along the shared east boundary; would appear as a disproportionate and insubordinate addition to the main dwelling that would be at odds with the character of the main dwelling and the character and appearance of Tudor Estate LASC. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed single storey rear extension by virtue of its excessive 4.0m depth along the shared east boundary; would prejudice the neighbouring amenities of no.9 Cardinal Avenue by way of loss of sunlight/daylight and outlook. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThree neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officer note following the submission of site photos that the proposed rear extension has already been built and that this application is in fact retrospective. This application will only assess the single strorey rear extension as stated on the application form dated 20/07/2020. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rSeven neighbouring properties have been notified and one representation has been received stating\r- Inappropriate design/layout\r- Noise\r- Privacy\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor extension would increase the original outrigger from approximatly 4.3 metres to 7.3 metre in depth, which would relate poorly to the host property, appearing as an incongruous feature. The proposed development is therefore unacceptable in terms of scale and form. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed ground floor extension would increase in width from approximately 3.2 metres to 5.2 metres extending the current outrigger across the whole width of the property. The total depth of the infill along the shared boundary with No. 45 would be 10.7 metres which result in an unacceptable loss of outlook, overbearing impact and an undue sense of enclosure to a principal habitable room window at neighbouring No. 45 Montem Road by virtue of its excessive depth along the boundary. The proposed 1st floor extension would appear overbearing when viewed from No. 49 Montem Road resulting in unacceptable living conditions for its occupants.\r\rThe proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and one representation has been received neither supporting or objecting to the development in relation to the party wall agreement and construction noise which will be addressed as an informative.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed extension would conflict with the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013 with regards to depth, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling. The proposed extension would not be visible from the street scene, therefore the impact on the surrounding area would not be significant. As such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  In terms of neighbouring residential amenity, the main properties to consider are No.42 and No.46 Coombe Lane West. The proposed rear extension has been set lower on the shared bounday with adjoining No.42  to reduce the impact in order to ensure it would not adversely effect the amenity of the adjoining property and would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to sunlight/daylight.  In relation to No.46, due to the seperation distance of the shared drive and the existing relationship due to the garages, Officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of No.46 by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling situated within Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Area of Special Character. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey (staggered) extension would be approx. 6m deep and approx. 3.5m deep on the boundary with No. 3 Rydal Gardens. The proposed flat roof approx. 3m high would feature two rooflights.  It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommend depths. However, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rThe proposed extension would not be visible from the streetscene, therefore the impact on the existing street scene and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Area of Special Character would not be significant. \r\rAs such the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the modest scale of the proposal it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposed changes to the ground floor west elevation would not result in an undue overlooking due to the existing fenestration and greenery in relation to No 5 Rydal Gardens, which benefits from the side extension/construction. \r\rIt is noted that No. 3 Rydal Gardens is situated within a Group Tree Preservation Order, however it is considered that the proposed extension would not result in an unacceptable impact on the protected trees. The Council's Tree and Landscape Officer raised no objections to the proposal. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
