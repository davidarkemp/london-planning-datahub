    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThere have been 2 objections to the proposal the points raised can be summarised as follows\r\r1) The development when taken together with other permissions / consents would result in a much enlarged dwelling out of character with neighbouring properties\r2) loss of light\r3) concern the property would be used as a large HMO\r\rIt is important to note that a recent approval, the Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions and installation of 1 x roof light to front roof slope to facilitate loft conversion and replacement garage was permitted development (19/03102/CPU)\r\rThere is an outstanding application for a replacement garage (20/03300/HOU), however, it is to be noted that the footprint of the proposed garage is similar to garages / outbuildings in the immediate vicinity. \r\rConcerns relating to a possible use of the extended dwelling as a HMO is not relevant to the assessment of this application. Any change would either be permitted development, or if a large HMO require planning permission.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Impact on parking provision\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rNeighbouring properties have been extended at ground floor in a way comparable to that proposed by the applicant. Whilst the proposed extension, at a ground floor, would not be in strict accordance with the guidance in the SPD, it would nonetheless be in keeping with extensions in the immediate vicinity of the site. \r\rWith regards to the first floor element, it is proposed that the property is extended at first floor along the side of the property with a projection from the rear. The proposal includes for a gap of 1m from the boundary of the site so as to avoid a terracing impact and has been designed to accord with the 45 degree guidance (daylight/sunlight).\r\rThe development would remove space available for the parking of a vehicle, however, it is evident that there is sufficient space remaining at the front of the property to provide off-street parking. \r\rThe proposed extension would result in a property which would appear, and is, larger than the neighbouring properties, however, it is considered that the larger property would not result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
