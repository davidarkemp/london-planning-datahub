    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time be inserted in the side elevations of the building/extension hereby permitted without the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and\tloss of privacy.\r",
    "The roof area of the existing extension hereby shall not be used as a balcony, roof garden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would abut the shared boundary with No. 4 Barnfield and would match the existing extension at No. 4 in terms of depth. It would infill the existing single storey rear extension, matching it in height, roof form and materials. The proposal would not be visible from the street, therefore it would not have any adverse impact on the existing street scene.\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to recommended depths. However, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling.\r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed extension would about the shared boundary with No. 4 Barnfield which already benefits from an existing single storey rear extension. It is noted that the small window on the side elevation at No. 4 would be affected by the proposal, however, it is understood not to be a principal habitable room window. As such, the proposed extension would not result in an uunacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of daylight and would meet BRE guidelines in relation to No. 4 Barnfield. It is noted that No. 4 Barnfield raised no objections to the proposal.\r\rDue to its siting and scale the proposed extension would not have a significant adverse impact on No. 8 Barnfield in terms of daylight/sunlight or an overbearing appearance. \r\rGiven the above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
