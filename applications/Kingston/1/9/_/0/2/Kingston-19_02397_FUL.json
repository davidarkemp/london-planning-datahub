The development would not accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and RBK CIL.\r\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or Â£2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \r\rWhen you have received approval of all reserve matters / discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email development.management@kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
