    "The fee required for your planning application is Â£ 462.00.  If payment is by cheque please make payable to Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames or via the Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002. You may also pay online via the RBK website www.kingston.gov.uk",
    "The Council considers the amendments to be material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment is refused",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Trees seen in person by officer just prior to lockdown.\r\rAssessment:\rThe three Cypress in question are a species poorly chosen for their location that have grown exponentially and are beginning to threaten the structure of the immediately adjacent garages. These trees are blocking a great deal of light to neighbouring properties as is typical of the species and making it difficult to use the adjacent parking spaces as they were intended. Whilst the presence of trees in this location is of high value, the serving of a TPO upon these specific trees was not well considered in the first instance and their removal is justified. The majority of adjacent residents have signed a petition in support of their removal and it is worth noting that as this is a small close the amenity offered by these trees is solely to that of these long term residents.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove with the requirement to plant 3 replacement trees in close proximity.\r\rT.1 Magnolia - 1m Holistic crown reduction to suitable growth points & 10% crown thin.\rT.3 Yew - Crown lift to 2.5m from ground level above public footpath and raise remaining crown to match this new level.\r",
