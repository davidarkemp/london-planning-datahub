    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension by virtue of its proposed 8.3m depth along the north-east boundary; would prejudice the neighbouring amenities of no.9 Landseer Road, by way of loss of outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed single storey side/rear extension by reason of it depth, design and detailing; would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous addition which would unbalance the character of the main dwelling and appear at odds with the character and appearance of the Landseer Road streetscene. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwellinghouse.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please submit a revised copy of an Ordnance Survey based site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red and adjoining land owned by applicant in blue, showing at least two road frontages and a North point.\r\rPlease note that the submitted site location plan was to incorrect scale.\r\rPlease also confirm/amend red outline as this differs to our records. Please outline the complete site in red and not just the building area.\r"
