    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension would visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties which would result in an incongruous form of development within the streetscene. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension by reason of its detailed design which includes its width across the entire roof and overall bulk; would fail to appear proportionate or subordinate to the original property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013)",
    "The site comprises an end of terrace dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposal on the Green Belt.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that the proposed single storey side extension would be approx. 5m wide and 3.5m high. The proposed width would significantly exceed the recommended 50% of the width of the original house (approx. 5.4m) and therefore the proposed development would fail to appear as a proportionate or subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. It would also have an adverse impact on the adjoining terraced dwellings as it would unbalance the terraces due to its scale and massing. As a result the proposed development would detract from the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the surrounding area in conflict with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the generous plot size and the siting of the proposal, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 13 (Protecting Green Belt Land) of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) (2019) states that the Government attaches great importance to Green Belts. The fundamental aim of Green Belt policy is to prevent urban sprawl by keeping land permanently open; the essential characteristics of Green Belts are their openness and their permanence. Inappropriate development is, by definition, harmful to the Green Belt and should not be approved except in very special circumstances.\r\rParagraph 144 of the NPPF (2019) is clear that \"When considering any planning application, local planning authorities should ensure that substantial weight is given to any harm to the Green Belt\".\r\rParagraph 145 of the NPPF (2019) includes a closed list of certain forms of development which are considered not to be inappropriate in the Green Belt.  In this case, part \"c\" is applicable and states that:\r\r\"c) the extension or alteration of a building provided that it does not result in disproportionate additions over and above the size of the original building;\"\r\rPolicy 7.16 of the London Plan (2016) sets out that the strongest protection should be given to London's Green Belt, in accordance with national guidance and inappropriate development should be refused, except in very special circumstances.  Policies CS3 and DM5 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012) also state that development in the Green Belt will only be supported if it is in accordance with national guidance.\r\rOfficer Comment: In this case the proposed development is considered to constitute \"an extension or alteration of a building\". The applicant has submitted plans which demonstrate that the proposed extension would increase the volume of the original dwelling by approximately 50%. Within this site specific context, it is considered that the proposed extension would fail to be a proportionate addition for the purposes of Paragraph 145(c) of the NPPF (2019). It is therefore considered that the proposed development would result in unacceptable harm to the spatial aspect of the openness of the Green Belt.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) and policies CSX and DMX of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Invalid block plan\r\rPlease provide a copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
