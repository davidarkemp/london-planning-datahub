    "The proposed first floor rear extension, by reason of its size, siting and design, would create a dominant addition that would detract from the architectural integrity of the host building. This would be harmful to both the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area, in conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed development would provide a poor standard of external amenity space, due to the size. The proposed dwelling would effectively operate with a single aspect and provide a poor degree of outlook. Accordingly, it is considered that the proposed development would result in a significantly substandard form of accommodation for future occupants of the proposed dwelling. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal would have a detrimental impact on the residential amenities of the owner/occupiers of  the first floor flats at numbers 244 and 246 Kingston Road, New Malden, by way of overbearing impact and loss of outlook.The proposal would therefore be contrary to the  National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "When undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays. \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r",

    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay Kingston CIL which is presently set at £50/sqm of development, as per charging zone 4, in this location; and the Mayoral of London's CIL (MCIL) which is presently set at £35/sqm of development.\r\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner. Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.\r\rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation. Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing. A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.\r\rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.",
    "Please ensure the submitted drawings include the previously approved Proposed Plan (clearly marked) and the new revised plans (both floor plans and elevations). From your submitted pack, the previously approved drawings have not been included",
    "The submitted plans are not accurate in that they state a depth of 4.4metres, which from looking at the plans shows the width of the conservatory. Looking at your submitted application, I beleive there to be some confusion with the depth and the width of the conservatory. Please either rectify the plans or the application form",
    "Please be advised that a fee of £145 is required for this application. This can be paid either online at www.kingston.gov.uk or by calling our Customer Service Team on 020 8547 5002"
