    "The proposed rear dormer roof extension by reason of its detailed design which includes: the absence of a sufficient set in from the side and eaves of the main roof; a sufficient down from the ridge of the main dwelling and its overall bulk; would fail to appear proportionate or subordinate to the original property. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed hip to gable roof extension would visually unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties which would result in an incongruous form of development within the streetscene of Highdown. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The applicant should note that provision of the new crossover will require a Crossover Application to be submitted to Highways. Any decision to grant such crossover will be dependent upon the outcome of a site survey undertaken as part of that Crossover Application. Further details on requirements for a new crossover can be found in the RBK Crossover Application Pack, available via the Council's website. \r",
