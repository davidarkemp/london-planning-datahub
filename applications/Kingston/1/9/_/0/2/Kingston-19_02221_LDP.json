    "The erection of single storey rear extension  and formation of driveway falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Class A and F of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\r",
    "Please supply existing and proposed elevations  at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work. (note) Where any part of a proposed development can be seen from an elevation (including party walls between properties), we require existing and proposed other side elevations.\r\r\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 07/07/2022.\r\rAssessment:\rThis is a high amenity tree worthy of a TPO, However, the works applied for to bore out feeding roots and install pipe liner will have no adverse impact on tree and are very necessary for the continued drainage of the entire site as their main sewer connection to which all site drainage leads.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
