    "During the period between the commencement and the substantial completion of the development approved by this permission, any trees on the site which are shown as being retained on the relevant approved plans shall be protected by way of fencing which meets the requirements of BS5837: 2005 \"Protection of Trees on Construction Sites\" (figures 4 and 5). The fenced area(s) shall be kept entirely free at all times of vehicles, vehicle movements, equipment and machinery. There shall be no changes to the soil level and no excavation of trenches within the fenced areas, no fires lit, no dumping of toxic chemicals and no retained trees shall be used for winching purposes.  If any retained tree is removed, uprooted, destroyed, dies, or is pruned or damaged in a way which negatively effects the amenity or landscape value of the tree, a replacement tree shall be planted in the same location, the size and species of which may be specified in writing by the council.\r\rReason: To prevent unnecessary damage occurring to the trees during building operations, thereby safeguarding the visual amenities of the site in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The development shall conform in all material aspects with the plans and details shown in the application as listed below, unless variations are agreed by the Local Planning Authority in order to discharge other conditions attached to this decision:\r\rReason:  For avoidance of doubt and in the interests of proper planning.\r",
    "The landscape scheme as previously submitted and approved shall be implemented within the first planting season following completion of the development and the tree planting and landscaping shall thereafter be maintained for five years to the satisfaction of the Local Planning Authority.  Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the areas shown to be so landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose. Alterations that affect these approved landscape details must be previously agreed to in writing by the local planning authority.\r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "No external lighting shall be installed without the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority.\rReason: In order that the lighting shall not cause nuisance to nearby occupiers or be a source of danger to road users in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The applicant is encouraged to significantly exceed the sustainability standards set out in Condition 5 in relation to C02 emissions and internal water usage and explore additional methods of improving the sustainability and energy conservation credentials of the proposed development.",
