    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r-carry out work to an existing party wall;\r-build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r-in some circumstances, carry out groundwork's within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay Kingston CIL which is presently set at £130/sqm of development; and the Mayoral of London's CIL (MCIL) which is presently set at £60/sqm of development. Payment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner. Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount. When you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation. Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing. A failure to do so will incur a surcharge. Should you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
    "Please complete the appropriate application form which can be downloaded from our website http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/permissiontypes\r\rPlease note that the incorrect form has been submitted.",
    "There is some confusion with your submitted drawings - as you have 2 drawings with the same drawing number PL 104 - kindly send the full set of drawings again so that your application can be validated"
