    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed infill extension would be approx. 2.6m deep, finished with a flat roof, approx. 2.8m high. It would integrate with the existing rear extension and garage. The proposed infill extension would not be visible from the street scene. The proposed conversion of the garage into habitable space and associated alterations are considered acceptable and of no significant impact on the street scene. The materials proposed by the applicant would match the existing dwelling and the parapet wall over the garage would be retained. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the modest scale of the proposal and its siting, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Policy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with Policies DM9 and DM10.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that permission for a very similar development was recently granted under application reference 19/02935/HOU, which is extant and could still be implemented on site. The only visual changes proposed by the current application over and above the previously approved application are that the height of the parapet above the single storey side extension would be increased by 150mm and the position of the roof light in the front roof slope would be altered slightly. Officers consider that these changes would not materially alter the character and appearance of the area and so officers' previous conclusions on this matter remain unaltered. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The single storey side extension would not project beyond either the front or rear building lines of the neighbouring property to the west and the proposed increased height is not considered to be in any way unneighbourly. The proposed changes versus the previously approved application are otherwise not considered to materially affect the amenities of neighbouring occupiers and so officers previous conclusions on this matter remain unaltered. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
    "Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                 \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r                                              \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area can be summarised as an area of individually designed detached and semi-detached houses dating from the 1850s set in a mature landscape on the edge of Richmond Park. \r\rThe proposed development is, overall, considered to be a modest and proportionate form of development which would not detract from the character and appearance of the area. While the extension to the eastern side of the property would have an unusual roof form, it would be small in scale compared to the dwelling and set well back from the dwelling's front wall and further still from the highway. It would, in any case, be constructed of high quality materials and so officers do not consider that it would upset the symmetry of the dwelling or in any other way detract from the historic significance of the conservation area. To the contrary, officers consider that the proposal would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and would not result in any harm to its significance.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
