    "The proposed development by reason of  its height, bulk, and design would present an unduly prominent building which fails to satisfactorily transition from the low rise residential streets surrounding the site to the higher rise town centre. As such the proposed development represents a feature that would be discordant and jarring and would be detrimental to the character and appearance of the surrounding area and the approach to the Town Centre. The proposal is contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 (Character, Design and Heritage), DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments) and DM11 (Design Approach) of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012);  Policy K9 (Design Quality in the Town Centre) of the LDF K+20  Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan (Adopted July 2008); and Policies 7.4 (Local Character) and 7.7 (Location and Design of Tall and Large Buildings) of the London Plan 2016.\r",
    "The proposal, by reason of its design and siting represents an overdevelopment of this restricted site resulting in the underprovision of communal and private amenity space  which would result in a substandard form of accommodation, adversely affecting the amenities of the future occupiers of the development. Therefore, the proposal would be unacceptable and contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments) and DM13 (Housing Quality and Mix) of the LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 of the LDF Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013). \r",
    "In the absence of a signed S106 legal agreement to ensure that the development would be car free and that car club membership is secured, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable additional level of parking pressure in the surrounding streets to the detriment of local parking conditions in the area which in turn could result in congestion and highway safety concerns. The proposal is therefore contrary to Policies DM9 (Managing Vehicle Use for New Development) of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), Policy 6.13 (Parking) of the London Plan 2016  and guidance contained within the LDF Sustainable Transport SPD (Adopted May 2013) and the Council's Planning Obligations SPD (2017).\r\r",

Officers are concerned that the side extension in the street scene would not appear well designed and out-of-place. Additionally, the proposed side extension would not maintain the set-back from the front wall of the original house by at least 500mm, as advised, in Policy Guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD, giving it a further prominent appearance.\r\rOfficers note that the conversion of the garage into habitable space with alterations to fenestration would slightly alter the appearance of the front elevation, however, it would not significantly detract from the wider street scene or the host dwelling and would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of Beresford Avenue as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of height and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  In addition, the applicant has failed to demonstrate, through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 165 and No. 169 Beresford Avenue in terms of daylight/sunlight. Given the scale of the extension and the proximity of neighbouring widows, it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. As such, the proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the omission of the garage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why the development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Site\r\rThe application site is a two-storey mid terrace dwellinghouse located on Burlington Road. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rPlanning History\r\r18/14456/HOU - Formation of vehicular access to proposed parking space. Application Granted on 09 Jul 2018. With conditions.\r\r17/14962/LDP - Erection of rear dormer roof extension with a front roof light to facilitate a loft conversion. Application Granted on 08 Nov 2017\r\rConsultations\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 representations were received OBJECTING to the proposal. It should be noted that both representations originated from the same address, and objected to the application on the grounds of:\rPrevious works at the site caused disruption and resulted in damage to neighbouring properties.\r\rThe points raised in these objections relate to previous building works carried out on site, and do not include objections to the current planning application. Furthermore, the points raised largely concern damage caused by these building works, which would be considered a civil matter. As such, the points raised will not be considered within this recommendation. \r\rConsideration\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance. \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\rThe impact of the development on fire safety. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. This extension would have a maximum depth of 5 metres and would have a predominately mono-pitched roof with a maximum height of approximately 3.7 metres. Whilst the proposed extension would far exceed the recommended maximum depth as outlined by the Residential Design SPD, Officers consider that the proposed extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate to the host dwelling. As a result, Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity would be the adjoining properties at No. 37a and No. 39a Burlington Road. \r\rIn relation to No. 37a, as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an loss of privacy to the occupiers of this neighbouring site. \r\rHowever, by reason of its excessive depth, in conjunction with its height and siting along the boundary, Officers consider that the proposed single storey rear extension would result in an overbearing appearance to the neighbouring property at No. 37a Burlington Road. \r\rFurthermore, given the depth and siting along the boundary of the proposed rear extension  and the proximity of neighbouring widows, it is considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. Officers therefore consider that the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 37a Burlington Road in terms of daylight/sunlight.\r\rIn relation to No. 39a, similarly as no windows are proposed facing this neighbouring property, Officers consider that the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the amenity of this neighbouring property. Moreover, due to the lesser depth of the proposed rear extension on the boundary with this neighbouring property, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an overbearing appearance to this neighbouring property. \r\rHowever, given the depth and siting along the boundary of the proposed rear extension  and the proximity of neighbouring widows, it is also considered that there is a likelihood that the development would breach the \"45 Degree Rule\" and reduce light entering into the neighbouring window, which in turn would harm the residential amenities of the occupant of the neighbouring property. Officers therefore consider that the applicant has failed to demonstrate through the submission of cogent information that the proposed single storey rear extension would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the closest ground floor principal habitable room window at No. 39a Burlington Road in terms of daylight/sunlight.\r\rTherefore it is considered that the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the amenity of neighbouring properties, by reason of an overbearing appearance and loss of sunlight/daylight.\r\r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises terrace dwelling.\r\r7 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  Officers acknowledge that the existing dwelling benefits from a garage which is not set back from the front wall by 500mm or more, therefore the proposed side extension would not appear overly prominent in the wider street scene, as it would be positioned similarly with the front wall. The pitched roof front extension (above the main entrance) would be visible in the street scene, however, it would be designed to respect the symmetry of any existing front extensions or features of the adjoining properties and would appear proportionate and subordinate. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed rear extension would not be in keeping with Policy Guidance 33 of the Residential Design SPD in regards to the guidance depth of 3.5meters. However, the proposal has a modest height of 3m with a slightly pitched roof. In addition, the rear extension would not be incongruous in regard to the rear building line of the wider area.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officer acknowledge that neighbouring property No. 50 Bolton Road benefits from a rear extension, as such, their amenity would not be harmed by the proposed rear extension. Neighbouring property No. 46 Bolton Road, would be set-back, being more likely to be affected by the proposed development, however, officers would not consider the covered walkway/storage area as a 'habitable space' there for the proposed extension would not breach the BRE 45-degree rule, in regards to No. 46 Bolton Road.\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. Officers consider that the conversion of the garage into storage would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site, as the hardstanding to the front of the property would provide adequate space for car parking. The proposed storage would provide sufficient space to store cycles. However, the loss of the garage would remove the potential for the safe storage of cycles, as such, it is reasonable to impose a condition requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted and approved.\r\rTherefore, overall, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "With the removal of the existing side access to the rear, the cycle parking facilities as shown cannot be practically and readily accessed from the road to the front of the dwelling.
