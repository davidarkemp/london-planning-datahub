    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) and Policy DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r\r\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted\tDevelopment) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time\tbe placed in the side elevations of the building/extension hereby permitted\twithout the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and\tloss of privacy.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling situated within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area, the Kingston Town Centre Area of Archaeological Significance and Flood Zone 2.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees.\r\rRepresentations:\rKingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objections\rTree and Landscape Officer - no objections\r\r5 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  Two owner/occupiers raised the following summarised concerns which are addressed in the assessment below:\ro\tLoss of daylight/sunlight\ro\tLoss of privacy/overlooking\ro\tExcessive height or bulk of buildings\ro\tInappropriate design/layout\ro\tUnacceptable or incompatible use\r\rOfficer's response: The concerns raised above will be addressed in the assessment. \rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.     \r                                                                                                                \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.     \r                                         \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area relates to an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre comprising houses of various sizes and designs dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855. \r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless contributes positively to the conservation area. The proposed extensions would not be visible from the street, therefore it would not have an impact on the existing street scene.  As stated above the proposed design and materials are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and would be appropriate given the location of the property within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rIt is noted that the Kingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee has raised no objections to the proposal.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would not be visible from the street. The rear/side element (a utility room) would project approx. 2.7m beyond the rear elevation of the existing garage and would match the garage eaves height of approx. 2.3m. The proposed rear extension (a family room) would project approx. 3.5m beyond the rear elevation and would feature a flat roof (proposed height approx. 3m) and a rooflight. \r\rIt is noted that scale/massing of the proposed development would follow the Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. It is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed materials are considered in keeping with original dwelling and the surrounding area and therefore acceptable. \r\rThere would be no impact on the existing car parking facilities as a result of the proposal. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that the proposed development would have an impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight on the side window of the extension at No. 1B Minerva Road, however considering the existing situation and the fact that the side window is not the only opening for this adjoining property, it is considered that the proposed extension would not result in unacceptable loss of daylight/sunlight. Furthermore, the proposal would meet BRE guidelines, passing the 45 degree rule in both plan and elevation view in relation to No. 1B Minerva Road. The proposal would also not result in an overbearing effect and loss of privacy, due to its scale, sitting and no proposed opening to the north elevation.\r\rThe proposed rear/side element of the proposal would be set in by approx. 0.8m from the common boundary with No. 69 Fairfield Road. It is noted that the rear extension of No. 69 Fairfield Road due to its sitting in relation to the site address and site orientation, receives limited amount of daylight/sunlight. Therefore the proposed extension due to its reasonable scale is not considered to have unacceptable impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight or overbearing effect in relation to this adjoining property. The proposed utility window on the south elevation due to the existing boundary treatment would not result in undue overlooking. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe proposed development would not have a significant impact on the protected trees. The Council's Tree and Landscape Officer raised no objections to the proposal subject to the development being conducted in strict adherence to the submitted information: Tree Survey, Arboricultural Impact Assessment & Arboricultural Method Statement dated 08.01.2021. \r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Form and Flood Risk Assessment submitted by the applicant indicates that the proposed single storey rear and side extensions would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8, DM4, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a staggered rear elevation. The total proposed enlargement (including existing extensions to the outrigger plus the proposed extension) would exceed limits set in Paragraphs A.1 (ja) and (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
