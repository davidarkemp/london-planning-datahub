    "Application Site\r\rThe application site is located on the west side of Richmond Road. It contains a detached two storey dwelling with a hipped roof. The property is externally finished in brickwork and render and has a tiled roof. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominately residential in nature. To the south-east of the site is Tiffin Girls School. To the west of the site are properties accessed off Lower Ham Road.\r\rThe site does not contain any statutory or locally Listed Buildings and is not located within a Conservation Area. The Riverside North Conservation Area is approximately 90m to the west of the application dwelling.\r\rThe site falls within Flood Zone 2 (medium probability). \r\rProposal\r\rPlanning permission is sought for the erection of a two storey side and rear extension (following demolition of existing rear conservatory) and associated loft extension with changes to fenestration. \r\rConsultation\r\rNeighbourhood notification: 8 neighbouring owners/occupiers were notified via letter dated 13.01.2021.  A total of 4 objections were received from separate addresses raising the following summarised concerns: \r\r- Excessive bulk;\r- Excessive glazing at the rear which would be out of character with the area;\r- The raising of the roof ridge line would be unnecessary and out of keeping with the area;\r- Loss of outlook, privacy and visual amenity for neighbours at Lower Ham Road and elsewhere;\r- The environmental impact of so much glazing in terms of additional heating/cooling;\r- Artificial light and light pollution from the proposed windows would spill out into back gardens affecting the ecosystem and bats;\r- The use of so much glazing must exceed the allowance under the light pollution guidelines;\r- Overdevelopment; and,\r- Terracing effect.\r\rThe applicants provided a response to the objections seeking to address the comments raised. Further details of the proposed non-reflective glass were also provided.\r\rAssessment\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings;\r- Flood Risk;\r- Impact on Biodiversity; and,\r- Highways and Parking.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Core Strategy states that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced include the following: \r\ra. Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy \rb. Prevailing density of the surrounding area \rc. Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms), massing \rd. Landscape setting and features \re. Plot width and format which includes spaces between buildings \rf. Building line build up, set back and front boundary \rg. Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges etc.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD (2013) sets out policy guidance for the character and design of residential developments (including domestic extensions). \r\rThe side element of the two-storey extensions would be approximately 2m in width in line with the front elevation of the existing dwelling and would be set back from the site boundary by approximately 0.2m. The two storey side extension would have a maximum depth of approximately 11m near the boundary with No. 263 Richmond Road to the south. The extension would continue the existing eaves height across the front of the extension and the roof form would be hipped.\r\rThe proposed development includes an increase in height of the main roof ridge by approximately 0.6m. The eaves height for the entire dwelling would be raised by approximately 0.3m. The resulting roof form would comprise hipped elements and a crown-type flat roof with a rear facing gable. The increased roof height would allow the inclusion of habitable accommodation within the roofspace.\r\rThe rear element of the two-storey extensions would have a maximum depth of approximately 6.2m when scaled off the submitted floor plan and a width of approximately 7.56m along the rear. Part of the extension would fall under the newly created gable ended roof while elements of the two-storey rear extension would have a wraparound flat roof of a maximum height of approximately 5.7m.\r\rIn terms of single storey rear extensions, an extension of a maximum depth of 8.3m would wraparound the proposed two-storey rear extensions presenting a maximum width of approximately 8.8m along the rear elevation. The single storey extension would be flat roofed. A new mono-pitch roofed front porch is also proposed.\r\rIt is indicated on the submitted drawings that the proposed extensions and existing dwelling would be painted render. Fenestration on the front elevation would be of a similar appearance to the existing, however, the extensions to the rear would comprise bi-fold doors at the ground floor level and floor to ceiling windows above.\r\rWith reference to the two-storey side extension, it is noted that the extension has been designed so that it appears as an integral part of the house, with no set-back from the front elevation. In terms of the proposed set-back from the shared boundary with No. 263 to the south, it is considered that the set-back of approximately 0.2m would be insufficient to maintain visual separation and characteristic gaps between Nos. 263 - 265, were No. 263 to build a similar two-storey side extension as is being proposed by No. 265.\r\rIt has been indicated on the submitted elevation drawings that the increase in roof height of 0.6m would result in an overall height which is still lower than the ridge heights of neighbouring properties. The raised eaves height would also remain lower than the eaves of neighbouring properties. \r\rHowever, it is considered that the part hipped/crown type flat roof, which would extend approximately 8m to the rear, would appear bulky and disproportionate to the existing dwelling. The orientation of the dwelling is such that the proposed two-storey side extension, increased roof height and rear gable would be readily visible within the street scene and would appear incongruous.\r\rRegarding the extensions to the rear, the flat roofed two-storey rear extension would not reflect the main roof of the existing dwelling, while the flat roof gable/dormer would appear discordant also. The proposed floor to ceiling windows would not reflect the existing fenestration which is of a more suburban residential appearance. While a more contemporary appearance can be appropriate in select circumstances, such design would need to be of a high quality, which the proposal is not.\r\rIn terms of proportions, the extensions to the rear would appear unresolved with a mismatch of roof forms, an incoherent design approach and a lack of visual relief. For example, at the ground floor level the proposed single storey rear extension presents a blank parapet roofed wall of up to 8.3m in depth (6.25m in depth at the first floor level) to No. 267 to the north. The south elevation would be approximately 12.2m in depth at the two storey level with no articulation or visual interest.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed extensions would not be proportionate or subordinate to the existing dwelling and would appear bulky, visually intrusive and incongruous within the street scene and when viewed from neighbouring properties. The lack of set-back from the boundary with No. 263 to the south would fail to preserve visual separation between these properties were No. 263 to extend in a similar manner to No. 265. \r\rNeighbouring Residential Amenity:\r\rParagraph 127(f) of the NPPF (2019) and Policy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) seek to ensure that development secures a good standard of amenity for all existing and future users of land and buildings.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seeks to safeguard residential amenities in terms of privacy, outlook, and sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rIt is noted that concerns have been raised in letters of objection in relation to: loss of outlook, loss of privacy and visual amenity.\rIn terms of daylight/sunlight, the positioning of the proposed extensions in relation to neighbouring properties is considered to be such as to ensure no significant loss of daylight or sunlight. However, it is considered that the combined excessive scale of the single and two-storey rear extensions would have an overbearing impact on No. 267 to the north and would result in an undue sense of enclosure.\r\rWith reference to loss of privacy, it is noted that the proposed rear facing floor to ceiling windows would far exceed the minimum 21m minimum separation distance between directly facing habitable room windows. While there would be angled views towards the rear gardens of neighbouring properties to the north and south along Richmond Road and wider views towards properties to the rear along Lower Ham Road, it is considered that these would not result in any significant loss of privacy given the relationship between the existing dwelling and neighbouring properties.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the combined effect of the excessive scale and depth of the proposed single and two storey rear extensions would be overbearing to No. 267 Richmond Road to the north and would result in an undue sense of enclosure.\r\rParking and Highway Safety:\r\rIt is stated that there would be no net loss of on-site car parking provision as a result of the proposals. A side access to the rear garden would be retained along the northern boundary of the property which would allow for the storage of cycles in the rear garden. Were the planning application to be otherwise acceptable, a planning condition would be attached requiring details of cycle parking to be submitted prior to the beneficial occupation of the development.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage:\r\rThe application site is located in Flood Zone 2 where the risk of flooding from rivers or seas is medium. The submitted information incorrectly states that the site is not in an area liable to flooding. \r\rIt would need to be demonstrated that the development would incorporate appropriate flood resistance and resilience measures given its location within fluvial Flood Zone 2 (medium probability of flooding). No flood resistance and resilience information has been submitted by the applicant and it has therefore not been demonstrated that the proposed development would not be at undue risk of flooding or increase flood risk on-site or elsewhere. \r\rBiodiversity\r\rNo protected trees would be impacted as a result of the proposed development. It is noted that concerns have been raised that light pollution from the large floor to ceiling windows could impact bats. Officers can confirm that the proposed development would not comprise works that would require a Natural England EPS licence.\r\rThe proposed development is for householder extensions within an urban area which is not subject to any biodiversity designations or protections. It is therefore considered that that the proposed development would not cause any significant harm which the Local Planning Authority could reasonably object to.\r\rConclusion\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
