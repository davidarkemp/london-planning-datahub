    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The applicant can contact the Highway Authority on 020 8547 5002.",
    "Please provide a copy of a site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red, showing at least two road frontages and a North point.\r",
    "Please note that the quality of advice will be proportionate to the level of information provided, therefore it is to the applicants benefit to provide as much supporting information as possible for the proposal. eg: plans and elevations, photographs and supporting documents.\r\rPlease note that you are required to submit drawings as we are unable to use previously submitted drawings for this pre planning application.",
    "Site inspection carried out in person with the School Caretaker on 16/11/2023.\r\rAssessment:\rAcceptable and or necessary works to manage and maintain the tree stock in line with best practise and duty of care regarding health and safety issues for students and neighbouring properties.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out in person on 16/11/2023.\r\rAssessment:\rThe trees were reduced a long way beyond what was permitted the last time works were carried out, the proposed works would take them even further back when they are only just recovering and would likely tip them into decline.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse & grant lesser works as follows:\r\rReduce to previous points & deadwood only.\r"
