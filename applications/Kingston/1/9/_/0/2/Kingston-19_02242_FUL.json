The use class order allows for a permitted change without the need for planning permission from use class C3 to C4. \r\rThe proposal seeks to intensify the HMO use by increasing the number of persons on site from 6 to 7.\r\rThe policies of the current development plan do not preclude such types of development.\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would be compatible with and would not change the primary use of the site a residential property albeit in a different use class. \r\rGiven the fall back position of the property being used currently as a HMO under the C4 use class without the need for planning permission and given the proposal's continued use of the site for residential purposes it is considered the principle development would be acceptable.\r\rQuality of accommodation\r\rThe proposed additional accommodation is considered to be of a practical layout and would be served by communal facilities including a kitchen, bathroom and private amenity space, ensuring an acceptable standard of living for future occupants. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design as it involves no external changes to the building or incrfease in the fotprint or volume of the building. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways:\r\rParagraph 111 of the National Planning Policy Framework (NPPF) 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. \r\rAs no off street parking is proposed for the additional person for the 7 person HMO use, it is recommended that permission is granted only on the basis that the applicant enters into a legal agreement. This would prevent the occupier and any visitors of the additional room from applying and obtaining an on-street residents or visitors parking permit in order to mitigate any potential additional on street car parking pressures as a result of the development. The applicant has agreed to enter into such an agreement and signed and completed said agreement.\r\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of a single storey rear conservatory extension.\r\rConsultation\r2x neighbouring properties have been notified and no representation have been received.\r\rAssessment\r\rCondition 12 imposed on planning permission 97/3406/FUL, applies to properties in Barker Close:-\r\r\"Notwithstanding the provisions of Part 1 of Schedule 2 of the Town & Country Planning (General Permitted Development) Order, 1995, or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no extensions (including porches or dormer windows to the dwelling houses or buildings shall by erected within the curtilage.\r\rReason: to safeguard the privacy and amenity of adjoining occupiers, maintain adequate amenity space and safeguard the cohesive appearance of the development.\"\r\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The retention of sufficient private outdoor amenity space which is readily accessible to the present and future occupiers of no. 6 Barker Close.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would be to the rear of the property. The proposal would replace an existing glazed rear/side addition. The proposed ground floor rear extension, would have no impact on the streetscene and would also appear to be a subordinate addition to the rear of the host property.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would project 3.0 metres to the rear of the host property. Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties and the proposed extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy, overbearing appearance, or loss of light.\r\rIt is stated in Policy Guidance 13 (Private Amenity Space) of the Residential Design SPD Adopted July 2013 that new houses (including conversions) should be provided with 50sqm of private garden per family house (+ 5sqm per extra bedroom over three). Where a proposal for new residential development relates to an existing residential development, additional floor space should not be achieved through the loss of private amenity space below these standards.\r\rThe proposed ground floor extension would cover an area of 11 square metres and would reduce the private outdoor amenity space readily accessible present and future occupiers of no. 6 Barker Close, to less than the 50sqm of private garden requirement outlined in Policy Guidance 13 (Private Amenity Space) of the Residential Design SPD Adopted July 2013.\r\rThe proposal fails to demonstrate that the present and future occupiers of no. 6 Barker Close, would be provided with sufficient private outdoor amenity space that is readily accessible from their property, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Site\rThe application site comprises a vacant, ground floor commercial unit located on the western side of Ewell Road. It has residential flats above. The site is located within the designated Ewell Road North Local Centre and the Oakhill Conservation Area.\r\rThe application site was granted planning permission for a change of use from a beauty treatment centre (Use Class Sui Generis) to taxi office (Use Class Sui Generis) under application ref: 15/16345/FUL, and has since been occupied bya mini cab office under the names of Mogul and Zedcarz Group. The current proposal involves the change of use from a taxi cab office to a personal trading studio (Use Class E).\r\rConsultation\r32 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rSurbiton CAAC - No response received.\rRBK Environmental Health Officer - No objection subject to conditions.\rRBK Highways Officer - No objection.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r-The principle of development;\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters; and,\r- The impact of the development on designated heritage assets.\r\rPrinciple of development\rPolicy DM17 states that the Council will protect, manage and enhance all employment land and premises in local centres so that they continue to provide locally accessible goods, services and employment.\r\rPolicy DM18 states that the Council will consider applications for new employment development (of an appropriate scale) in designated employment locations favourably.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal would replace an existing, albeit vacant, taxi office (Sui Generis) to provide a personal training studio which would fall under Class E(d) use. No changes to the floorspace on site are proposed. It is considered that the proposed use would be an appropriate use within the designated local centre and that by bringing a vacant unit back into use it would enhance its vitality and viability, providing employment floorspace and employment opportunities.\r\rOfficers note that the proposal does not seek any changes to the shopfront.  Any changes in this regard may require a separate planning permission and advertisement consent. \r\rDesign \rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposals would not involve any external alterations to the shopfront, and as such there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the property, or the immediate surrounding area.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposed hours of use would be 0630 - 2130 Mon - Sat and 0930 - 1730 on Sundays and Bank Holidays. \r\rIt is considered that the proposal could create noise and disturbance to neighbouring residents as a result of the hours of operation and the movement of customers to and from the premises, as well as the exercise classes provided on site due to the use of heavy, noise generating equipment, alongside background music. However, officers note that the proposal would only offer one-to-one classes, not group classes and that sound insulation (as mentioned within the planning statement provided in support of the application), would be implemented on site. Taking these matters into consideration, and subject to conditions to upgrade the proposed sound insulation, preclude group exercise classes, and restrict hours of operation, officers consider that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residents in this regard.\r\rFurther, given that the floorspace of the building would remain the same, with no changes to the shopfront, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, or loss of privacy. \r\rHighways and Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comment: The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ), which means parking is restricted and has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) score of 4 (good), which means that the site is considered accessible by public transport. Officers also note that bus numbers 281, 406 and 418 run regular services along Ewell Road. \r\rOfficers note that no car parking for staff or customers is proposed and that one-to-one training/exercise classes are proposed with a maximum of 12 clients visiting the site per day. The London Plan would require a commercial space of this nature to provide 1 long stay cycle parking space per 8 FTE staff and 1 short stay cycle parking space per 100sqm (GEA), and officers note the proposal would provide 2 spaces for cycle storage, internally within the commercial unit. While the applicant has not provided details of the proposed cycle storage, officers consider that this could be secured via an appropriate condition in the event of an approval to ensure policy compliance.\r\rGiven the proposed number of clients visiting and using the premises at any one time, as well as the fact that the site is well connected by public transport and would incorporate cycle storage, it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse impact upon highway or pedestrian safety. \r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Oakhill Conservation Area can be summarised as a Regency and early Victorian linear housing development made up of two separate areas Oakhill Conservation Area (A) which runs along the old turnpike road of Ewell Road and Oakhill Conservation Area (B) which is made up of five large properties in Langley Road. The area around Ewell Road was later converted to a commercial centre, together with an area of substantial Victorian houses and The Wood open space to the west.\r\rAs noted above there are no external extensions or alterations proposed and officers conclude that there would be no adverse impact upon character and appearance. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Oakhill Conservation Area, but rather the proposal would preserve it.  Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposal against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth, however it would have an appropriate height and roof form. Further, given that the extension would sit in a spacious plot, officers consider that the proposed development would appear a modest addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character or appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest eaves height, and the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The applicant is advised that background music is music which is played at a low volume, whereby customers/trainers are not required to raise their voices to converse with one another and is not the main focus of the attention within the room.  It should be devoid of any dominant bass beat.",
    "The site comprises a 2 storey terraced house.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals.

Although the proposed development would not be set down by 500mm from the ridge, it would be set in from the sides and up from the eaves by more than 500mm and therefore appear subordinmate and proportionate. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.
