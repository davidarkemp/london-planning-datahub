    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant planning policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.",
    "Section 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF 2019 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application concerns Kingston Bridge, which is a Grade II* Listed Building in the north-western corner of the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area. The significance of the bridge can be summarised as a well-preserved and attractive stone bridge in the Grecian style, dating from the early 19th Century but built on the site of a much earlier wooden structure, which is thought to have been in place prior to the Norman conquest of England. The bridge has further significance in its contribution to the development of Kingston-upon-Thames as a historic market town.\r\rThe proposal is to carry out repairs to masonry which has been surveyed and shown to be damaged. Those elements which are damaged beyond repair would be replaced on a like-for-like basis.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the applicant has consulted the relevant historic records and provided a description of the bridge which is proportionate to its significance. The applicant has demonstrated that the proposed works are necessary in the interests of the structural integrity of the bridge and to preserve its significance. Subject to conditions relating to recording of those features which are to be disturbed during the course of the works and relating to the materials and methods to be used during the repair works, officers are satisfied that the proposed development would preserve the listed building and its features of architectural and historic significance.\r\rAccordingly, it is recommended that listed building consent be granted.",
    "In accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and\r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would involve the erection of a dormer above the existing two storey outrigger, which is shared with the attached property No. 21 Bellevue Road, together with the insertion of a roof light within the front roof slope. \r\rPolicy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that dormers should be designed so that they: are set down from the ridge line of the existing roof by at least 500mm; are set in from the sides and eaves of the roof by at least 500mm; do not feature on the front slope of the roof (in most cases); are designed to complement the character of the existing house and wider area; match or line-up with any original windows below; and are not built in the style of a mansard roof.\r\rThe proposed dormer would be in the style of a mansard, which would neither respond well to the existing property, nor to other surrounding properties, and would be contrary to the above guidance. Rather than being set down from the ridge of the outrigger, it would actually project above it by approximately 700mm and to accommodate this, the parapet which marks the dividing line between the application site and the attached neighbouring property would be raised by a corresponding amount. This would result in a significant imbalance between the property and its attached neighbour and would create a highly unusual feature within the roofscape when viewed from the south. The proposed finishes - i.e. slates and aluminium cladding - would also be at odds with the finishes of the existing property and would further add to the incongruous appearance of the proposal.\r\rOfficers further note that roof lights do not feature on the front elevations of properties on Bellevue Road and therefore this element of the proposal would also be at odds with the character and appearance of the area.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the proposed dormer would be located above the existing roof slope, it is considered unlikely that it would appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. While the proposed windows would afford some degree of overlooking of neighbouring properties, the views would be materially similar to those already on offer from the property and the typical relationship between properties in the area is one where residents are afforded some degree of aspect of their neighbours. Having regard to these considerations, officers conclude that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties in terms of overbearing appearance, loss of light and loss of privacy.",
    "Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.\r\rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.                                              \r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The site is located within the Grove Crescent Conservation Area. The significance of this area can be summarised as a planned mid-Victorian estate of houses of various sizes and styles, the core of which forms the Spring Grove Estate, including St John's Church, a school, and local shops. The application property makes a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area as an attractive and relatively well-preserved late-Victorian dwelling.\r\rAs noted above, officers conclude that the proposal would result in harm to the character and appearance of the area. Although the impact of the proposed dormer on the conservation area would be somewhat limited by its location atop one of the rear roof slopes, it would nevertheless be visible from surrounding properties and glimpsed views may also be possible from Alfred Road. In any case, the proposed roof light would feature prominently within the front roof slope of the property and this element in itself leads officers to conclude that the proposal would result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the conservation area.\r\rAs the proposal is for residential extensions and is small in overall scale, it would only offer very limited, private benefits to the current and future occupants of the dwelling. Therefore, there are no public benefits to outweigh the less than substantial harm to the conservation area.\r\rIn conclusion, officers consider that the proposal would respond poorly to the host property and its neighbours, resulting in harm to the character and appearance. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe proposal would also result in harm to the significance of the Grove Crescent Conservation Area. As there are no public benefits to outweigh this harm, the NPPF directs that permission should be refused and the proposal would conflict with policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policy DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.\r\rOfficers note that the applicant has provided examples of roof extensions in the surrounding area. The development at No. 17 Bellevue Road does not appear to have the benefit of planning permission and so cannot be afforded any weight in the assessment of this application. The application at Nos. 16 and 18 Bellevue Road involved a comprehensive redesign of the rear outrigger at both properties and as a result, a considerably different appearance to that which is currently proposed. Finally, the application at No.5a Grove Lane predated the NPPF 2020, the London Plan 2016 and the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and these considerable changes in planning policy circumstances mean that it can be afforded little weight. In any event, these examples would not constitue an irresistible precedent and each application must be considered on its own merits.  \r\rThe proposed development conflicts with policies 7.4, 7.6 and 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and there are no other material considerations which indicate that planning permission should be granted. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings; and\r- The impact of the development on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would involve the erection of single storey rear extensions, the erection of a glass box dormer above the existing rear roof slope, and the insertion of a roof light within the front roof slope.\r\rThe proposed single storey extensions would be well hidden from any public vantage points and would not be especially prominent in views from surrounding properties owing to their location at ground floor level. Although the flat roof design would be at odds with the existing pitched roof design of the property, it would nevertheless appear as a fairly typical residential extension and so would not appear incongruous.\r \rThe proposed glass box dormer would be a much more unsual feature, owing not only to its finish but also its small scale. Officers consider that this very much would appear as an incongruous addition to the roof scape and would result in harm to the character and appearance of the area.\r\rOfficers further note that roof lights do not feature on the front roof slopes of properties on Bellevue Road and therefore this element of the proposal would also be at odds with the character and appearance of the area.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the proposed dormer would be located above the existing roof slope and would be entirely glazed, it is considered unlikely that it would appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. While it would afford some degree of overlooking of neighbouring properties, the views would be materially similar to those already on offer from the property and the typical relationship between properties in the area is one where residents are afforded some degree of aspect of their neighbours.\r\rThe proposed single storey extensions would be relatively modest in scale and would not exceed the height of the existing single storey structures at the rear of the property, nor the existing rear building line of the property. They would also be well spaced from No. 17 Bellevue Road and as a result, would be unlikely to appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. \r\rHaving regard to these considerations, officers conclude that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties in terms of overbearing appearance, loss of light and loss of privacy.",
