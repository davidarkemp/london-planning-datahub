    "Condition 7  (drainage scheme) - RBK Flood Risk Officer has reviewed the information provided and requires more information before the application can be approved\r\rDrainage hierarchy:\rFAIL - the application does not comply with the hierarchy of drainage set out in the London Plan, Policy 5.13. Permeable paving is proposed to attenuate and discharge surface water generated by the proposed development. No acceptable justification has been provided for the non-inclusion of rainwater harvesting or infiltration measures. Water butts should be considered. Soakage testing should be undertaken to demonstrate that infiltration measures are not feasible on the site. It is stated that \"the access path and parking spaces will be allowed to drain freely to the surface water sewer\". This is not considered suitable, as there are likely to be polluted flows associated with the parking spaces that must be suitably treated before discharging to the existing surface water sewer.\r\rRunoff rate:\rFAIL - cannot assess application due to missing information (require the greenfield runoff rate).",
