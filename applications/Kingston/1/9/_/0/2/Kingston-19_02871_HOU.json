    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r \r",
    "The development  hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\rRepresentations:\r8 surrounding owner/occupiers were notified of the proposals.  One letter has been received raising the following summarised concerns:\r\r-\tExcessive height or bulk of buildings; and,\r-\tLoss of daylight/sunlight.\r\rOfficer response: The above concerns will be addressed in the following assessment. \r\rThe current application is a revised scheme following planning permissions ref no 19/02053/HOU and 19/00408/HOU for the erection of a part single storey, part two storey side and rear extensions.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  It is acknowledged that the proposed side extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 36 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as it would not be set back from the front elevation and would abut the common boundary, resulting in the loss of separation gap between the properties at ground floor level.\r\rIt is also noted that that the characteristic the cat-slide roof which is characteristic of properties in the area would be lost to accommodate the proposed development. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the existing street scene has examples of similar side extensions where the cat-slide roof feature was not retained and the extensions were not set back as required, therefore it is considered that the proposed single storey side extension would not be out of character with properties in the immediate surrounding area and is acceptable in this case.\r\rThe proposed part single, part two storey rear extension would project approx. 6m beyond the rear line of the existing building. The extension at first floor level would measure approx. 3.1m in depth. As the host dwelling is linked with No. 1 Hollington Crescent and the proposed two storey element would be situated close to the common boundary and it would project approx. 3.1m beyond the existing rear building line at 1st floor level, it is considered to unbalance the properties and would be a disproportionate addition that would be excessive in terms of its bulk, scale and mass. Furthermore, due to its siting, bulk, scale and mass the proposed rear extension would be visible from Purbeck Avenue and result in an unacceptable impact on the existing street scene.\r\rIn isolation the proposed single storey rear extension element is considered acceptable, but in combination with the first floor addition to the rear would be excessive in terms of its bulk, scale and mass.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed two storey rear extension due to its siting and excessive bulk, scale and mass  would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property No.1 Hollington Crescent by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of outlook and creaation of an undue sense of enclosure. \r\rWhilst the proposed development would result in some loss of daylight/sunlight in relation to the adjoining properties, this loss would not be to an unacceptable degree as the proposal would meet BRE guidelines. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed two storey rear extension element by virtue of its siting and excessive bulk, scale and mass would unbalance the application property and its neighbour, No 1 Hollington Crescent and constitute a disproportionate addition. Due to its visibility from Purbeck Avenue it would also result in an unacceptable visual impact on the street scene.  As such, the proposed two storey rear extension would detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area, conflciting with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rIn terms of residential amenity the proposed two storey rear extension element by reason of its siting and excessive bulk, scale and mass would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of the adjoining property No.1 Hollington Crescent by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of outlook and creaation of an undue sense of enclosure. The proposed development is therefore contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r",
