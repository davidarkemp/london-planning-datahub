    "The proposed extension is considered to cause an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenity of neighbouring property No 82 as it would result in an unacceptable sense of enclosure, loss of outlook and loss of daylight to the principal window of the dining room, thereby conflicting with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy, 2012 and the Residential Design SPD, 2013.",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a rear outrigger. The proposed extension would extend beyond the side elevation of the outrigger and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
