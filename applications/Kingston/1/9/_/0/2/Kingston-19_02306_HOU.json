    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof area of the extension hereby permitted shall not be used as a balcony, roof\tgarden or similar amenity area without the grant of further specific planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining\tpremises.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.  This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner.  If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "Please note that your application is required to details which matters you would like reserved, as part of your Outline Application",
    "The fee required for your planning application is Â£206.00, payment can be made via our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002 or by cheque made payeble to Royal Borough of Kingston.  Please ensure to quote your application number when making payment.",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThis is an examplary specimen that has been well looked after and maintained for many years and for which the Council recently worked hard to ensure adequate protection was afforded during the construction of the adjacent property. The works proposed are extremely excessive and would both drastically reduce the public amenity contribution of the tree as well as likely bringing about its early death.\r\rRecommendation:\rRefuse."
