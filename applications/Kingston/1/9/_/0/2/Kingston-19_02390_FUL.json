    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises Coombe Girls' School & Sixth Form Centre. The site is bounded by Clarence Avenue to the south and Darley Drive to the west with the site entrance accessed via Clarence Avenue.\r\rThe existing school comprises a mix of one and two storey buildings with associated car parking, games courts and playing fields. The surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance consisting of two storey semi-detached dwellings. \r\rThe site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rRemoval of part boundary wall for pedestrian access route to access Sixth Form Centre from Darley Drive. Erection of 2 nos brick piers on either side of the new boundary opening.\r\rRepresentations\r67 properties were notified of the proposal.\rTwo representations have been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car parking issues\r- The proposal is incompatible with road safety on Darley Drive.\r\rOfficer Comment: The above concerns would be addressed with the report.\r\rAny comments relating to the highways for example: the appropriate speed limit on Darley Drive, additional crossing point or road marks should be addressed to the Council's Highways department as they are not planning matters and cannot be taken into consideration when determining this application. \r\rKingston Council has launched a Let's Talk hub where residents can raise various issues and share their comments and suggestions about how to improve various aspects of the borough including our Highways programmes, information about this can be found on the council's website or access directly https://kingstonletstalk.co.uk/hub-page/our-streets\r\rConsultations\rRBK Highways and Transportation - no objections:\r\r'The proposed new pedestrian access would reduce potential for person/vehicle contact and make the school more accessible by bus.\r\rThe applicant should note that the footway/highway must not be blocked or used for materials storage without the necessary highway licence being obtained beforehand. Any incidental damage to the footway must be reported and the applicant would be responsible for covering in full any associated costs incurred by Highways in remedying such damage.'\r\rTransport for London - No comments offered\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Highway Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed new pedestrian access route would involve removal of part of the existing boundary wall, installation of two brick piers on either side of the new opening and new metal rails and provision of new steps. The proposal would provide a new access from Darley Drive to the schools facility, as currently it is being accessed mainly via the existing car park. \r\rIt is noted that the proposed design and height of the proposed brick piers would match the existing ones. Due to the proposed design, scale and materials the proposal is considered to be in-keeping with the host building and the existing boundary treatment. As such, there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighway Safety\rParagraph 111 of the NPPF, 2021 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rIt is noted that the RBK Highways and Transportation Officer raised no objections to the proposal.\r\rGiven the siting, scale and nature (additional pedestrian access to the school's facility) of the proposal, it is considered that it would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network.\r\rConcerns have been raised in written representations that the proposal would result in the following:\r- Access or traffic problems\r- Car parking issues\r- The proposal is incompatible with road safety on Darley Drive.\r\rOfficers note that the proposal is for an additional pedestrian access to the school's facility, therefore it would not necessarily result in material and unacceptable impact on the existing car parking facilities or result in increased traffic issues or safety issues.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a mid terrace dwelling located within the Flood Zone 2. \r\rProposal \rErection of a part single and part double-storey rear extension and erection of a new porch.\r\rRelevant planning history:\r\r22/03652/CPU  Erection of single-storey detached outbuilding 5.5m x 5.5m with a maximum height of 2.5m granted on 17.01.2023\r22/03313/CPU Erection of single storey rear extension and a new outbuilding granted on 12.12.2022\r22/03239/PAEXT  Erection of single storey rear extension (4.5m in depth, maximum height of 2.8m and eaves height of 2.6m) granted on 21.11.2022\r22/03214/HOU Erection of single storey rear extension granted on 13.12.2022\r22/02659/HOU Erection of a part single and part double storey rear extension and new porch granted on 11.10.2022\r\rConsultations\r23 properties were notified of the proposal.  \rThree representation has been received with comments summarised as follows:\r- Inadequate landscaping/means of enclosure (ownership of a land to the rear)\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/sunlight\r- Noise \r\rOwnership matters are not considered to be material planning consideration, therefore they cannot be included within the assessment. The other concerns will be addressed within the report. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Flood Risk;and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would project approximately 4.5m beyond the rear elevation and would have eaves height of approximately 2.6m. The two storey element would project 3m beyond the rear building line. It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depths which in this case are up to 3.5m. \r\rHowever, it is noted that the application site benefits from permitted development rights for larger home extensions which is considered a fallback position in this case. Therefore, having regard to the 'fallback' position, no objections are raised with respect to this element. Similarly, the two storey rear extension has the benefit of planning permission via application 22/02659/HOU. In essence, this application seeks to combine the approvals granted via 22/02659/HOU and 22/03239/PAEXT, albeit with a modified roof design to the single storey rear extension. \r\rOfficers note that the neighbouring properties benefit from the single storey rear extensions, it is considered that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of its scale, mass and bulk in relation to the host dwelling and the adjoining terraced properties. \r\rThe proposed rear extension would not be visible within the street view, therefore there would be no impact on the existing street scene. \r\rThe proposed front porch due to its scale, design and materials is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and  the surrounding area. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that the adjoining property No 73 Addison Gardens benefits from planning permission 20/01551/HOU for Erection of porch, part single/part double storey rear and side extensions that according to Building Control records has been implemented. The proposed extension would extend approximately 1.7m beyond the adjoining extension. \r\rNo 69 Addison Gardens shows an existing rear extension.\r\rAs such it is considered that the proposed rear extension due to its scale and siting would not result in an overbearing effect or sense on enclosure, loss of light or loss of privacy.  The proposal would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to both adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties. \r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rThe submitted plans indicate that floor levels within the proposed development would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details are agreed and that Condition 3 (Structural Method Statement) of listed building consent 21/01116/LBC is hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.\r",
