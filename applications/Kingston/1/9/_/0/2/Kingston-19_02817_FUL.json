    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from 05/11/2018. \r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990. (As amended)",
    "Sample of the facing materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to any above ground works taking place. The development shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples and thereafter retained as such. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The car parking accommodation shown upon the approved drawings shall be provided with a permeable hard bound dust free surface, adequately drained before the development to which it relates is occupied and thereafter it shall be kept free from obstruction at all times for use by the occupier of the development and shall not thereafter be used for any purposes other than the parking of vehicles for the occupiers of the development and visitors to it.  \r\rReason: To ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking accommodation and to avoid the congestion of surrounding roads by parked vehicles in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development shall not be occupied until there has been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority a scheme of hard and soft landscaping, including the treatment of boundaries and means of enclosure. Such scheme shall include the location of all existing trees and hedgerows on the site and details of those to be retained. The approved scheme (with the exception of planting, seeding and turting) shall be implemented prior to the occupation of the buildings hereby approved. All planting, seeding or turfing shall be carried out in the first planting and seeding seasons following occupation of the buildings or completion of the development, whichever is the sooner; any trees or plants which, within a period of 5 years from the completion of the landscaping die, are removed or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of similar size and species. \r\rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "No part of the development hereby approved shall be occupied until evidence has been submitted to the council confirming that the development has achieved not less than the CO2 reductions (ENE1), internal water usage (WAT1) standards equivalent to Code for Sustainable Homes level 4. Evidence requirements are detailed in the \"Schedule of evidence Required for Post Construction Stage from Ene1 & Wat1 of the Code for Sustainable Homes Technical Guide. Evidence to demonstrate a 19% reduction compared to 2013 part 1 regulations and internal water usage rates of 1051/p/ day must be submitted to and approved by the Local Planning Authority, unless otherwise agreed in writing. \r\rReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation in accordance with Policies 5.2 (Minimising Carbon Dioxide Emissions) and 5.3 (Sustainable Design & Construction) of the London Plan Consolidated with Alterations since 2011 (March 2015) and Policy DM1 (Sustainable Design and Construction Standards) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",

Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The development shall not be occupied until details of fences, walls or other means of enclosure to be erected around the boundaries of the site and to divide the private and communal amenity areas have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority.

    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 5 (Construction Management Plan) of planing permission 19/02417/HOU is hereby discharged.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe proposal is a revised scheme of the planning permission ref. no. 20/01192/HOU dated 27.05.2020 that includes raising the height of the existing roof ridge by approx. 23cm.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side and wrap around extension would have eaves height of approx. 2.4m. The single storey extension would feature part flat part pitched roof with 4 rooflights and would project approx. 3.5m beyond the rear elevation. The side extension would be finished with pitched roof and would be approx. 1.7m wide. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed wrap around extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 and 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. However, it is considered that the proposed single storey extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling.\r\rThe proposed loft conversion comprises raising the roof ridge by approx. 23cm, erection of hip to gable and 2 no. rear dormers and removal of cat-slide roof feature. The principle of the proposed roof extension was established in previously granted planning permission ref. no. 20/01192/HOU. The revised scheme proposes increased roof ridge, which considering the existing street scene varied in style and design and roof lines of the surrounding properties is considered acceptable. It is noted that the adjoining property No. 91 Gainsborough Road has been extended significantly, and it is considered that the site address and No. 91 no longer read as a pair with the streetscene. Given the above it is considered that the proposed development wold not have significant impact on the existing street scene and the adjoining property. \r\rThe proposed materials are considered in keeping with original dwelling and the surrounding area and therefore acceptable.\r\rAs such the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Due to the modest height of the proposal and no openings on the side elevations of the wrap around extension, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. It is noted that the proposed extension would not result in unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to No. 91 Gainsborough Road as the proposed extension would meet BRE guidelines, passing the 45 degree rule in elevation view. \r\rThe proposed openings to the roof extensions would not result in undue overlooking or loss of privacy due to the sitting of the proposal and the fact that the views from the dormers towards neighbouring properties would not be significantly different to those of the first floor windows at the property. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
