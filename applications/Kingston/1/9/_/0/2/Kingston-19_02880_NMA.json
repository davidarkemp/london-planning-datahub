    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received relating to the party wall. However, concerns relating to a party wall agreement would not be material to the assessment of this application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- Cycle parking.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey side extension would not strictly conform to the guidelines set by the Residential Design SPD, given that it would be set back considerably from the front elevation, be of a modest scale and be finished in materials that are in keeping with the host property, officers consider that it would be a subordinate and appropriate addition to the original dwelling, and have no adverse impact upon the streetscene. The proposed single storey rear extension element would conform to the guidelines as set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such overall officers consider it to be a subordinate and appropriate addition to the original dwelling. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that there are no openings proposed to the side elevations of the extension there would be no adverse impact to loss of privacy for the neighbouring properties. Further, given the modest depth and height of the proposed rear extension on the shared boundary with No. 45 Northcote Road there would be no adverse impact to amenities by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of sunlight/light. For No. 41 Northcote Road, given that the proposed side and rear extension would not project beyond their rear building line, the proposed development would have no adverse effect on the amenities of No. 41 Northcote Road by reason of loss of light/sunlight or privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that existing car parking provision would not be affected on site. As to cycle parking London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the access to the rear garden from the front of the property would be removed by the proposed development and it is not clear from the plans where any cycle parking would be accommodated, officers consider that a condition requiring details in this regard is necessary to demonstrate compliance.\r\rSubject to the satisfaction of the condition detailed above the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, cycle parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with London Plan Policy T5 Policy CS6, DM8, DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
