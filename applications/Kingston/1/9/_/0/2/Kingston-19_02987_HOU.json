    "The application site comprises a Locally Listed detached building which is classified as a non- designated heritage asset. The site is located within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. It is also located with an Area of Archaeological Significance. The application site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 1b (Poor) and is located within Flood Zone 1 (low probability). All trees on site are protected by section 211 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 and the site is within a group Tree Preservation Order (TPO)\r\rPublicity: \rIn addition to a press notice and site notice being displayed, 9 neighbouring occupiers were notified of the application. \r\rRepresentations: \rMaldens and Coombe Area Advisory Committee - no objection. \rTree and Landscape Officer - no objections subject to safeguarding conditions. \rGreater London Archaeology Advisory Service (GLAAS): No comments \r\rOne representation has been received from a local resident raising no objection to the architectural merit of the proposal, however, an objection is raised in regards to traffic congestion arising from the use of the building. Officer comment: This application does not concern a change of use and as such traffic impacts do not form part of the assessment of the proposal. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- character and appearance; \r- Residential amenity of neighbouring occupiers; \r- Heritage assets; and\r- Protected trees. \r\rAssessment:\rHeritage and Character and Appearance: \rSection 72(1) of the Planning (Listed buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires special attention to be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of the conservation area. \r\rParagraph 193 of the NPPF states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset (in this case the conservation area), great weight should be given to the asset's conservation. The more important the asset, the greater the weight should be.  Paragraph 196 of the framework states where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use.\r\rParagraph 197 of the NPPF directs that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rAt the regional policy level Policy 7.8 of the London Plan, 2016 (consolidated with alterations since 2011) states that development affecting heritage assets and their settings should conserve their significance, by being sympathetic to their form, scale, materials and architectural detail.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rThe Coombe Wood Conservation Area was designated in 1990 and the special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as: Large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course.\r\rCritical to the area's development was the laying out of three large mansions by John Galsworthy and his family on 93 acres of land fronting George Road between 1862 and 1886. The subject building, a locally listed building, is located within the curtilage of Galsworthy's second mansion, Coombe Leigh, occupied by the Holy Cross Prep School. The Site was constructed as the lodge to Coombe Leigh, situated to its northern boundary along George Road. The lodge retains association with the school, as the caretaker's house, and is accessed from the main school gates which retain impressive piers. The applicant has recently obtained a certificate of lawful development under section 191 confirming the lawful use of the building in connection with the Holy Cross Prep School. \r\rIn summary, the lodge is a surviving example of Victorian gothic revival architecture which is enhanced by its prominent position on George Road which directly contributes to the architectural and historical character of the conservation area. The main core of the lodge is formed from a north-south range with two east-west cross wings on the south and west elevations. These ranges are 1.5 storeys tall, constructed in red brick with contrasting blue brick detailing in the form of banding and blind arches. The brick is complemented by stone footers and other stone dressings/detailing including large transom and mullioned windows, with the northern elevation windows at ground floor set into projecting bays, and smaller pointed windows to the upper floor. The roof is laid with slate tiles in a fish scale pattern and topped with impressive brick chimney stacks.\r\rThe building envelope of the lodge has remained relatively consistent since its construction. The key exceptions are two single storey flat-roofed extensions that adjoin its west elevation. Both are considered to be of no architectural interest. The first extension, abutting the northern east-west range is earlier and incorporates red brick with soldier course brickwork above the windows and at the parapet. A small building adjoining the tip of the east-west range to the lodge is evident on late 19th and early 20th century maps. However, the present extension appears later in terms of its architectural pattern and has been infilled. It is likely, therefore, to represent a later rebuild. A lower flat-roofed extension, orientated northwest-south-east, with plain timber fascia boards dates to the late 20th century.\r\rThe lodge has a small garden which is surfaced with modern materials and incorporates a car port (accessed from a timber gate along the main drive of the school). It is also bounded by close board fencing, other than a section of retained brick along the east elevation and adjoining driveway.\r\rThe site is in relative proximity to designated assets including the Gallows Conduit and Conduit House (Grade II* and scheduled). Holy Cross prep school, Robin Hill Cottage (former lodge to the adjoining Coombe Warren) and Hampton Spring (situated to the west of the Site on George Road) are also locally listed buildings, however, due to the modest nature of the works and the level of spatial/visual association with these assets, it is considered that the proposal would not impact the significance or setting of any of these assets. \r\rThe proposed development, namely the erection of two modest flat roofed single storey rear extensions to the rear and west, adjoining the existing modern extensions with alterations to the fenestration (to the existing extensions) and laying of a new wet pour surface, would not extend the earlier building envelope, maintain the established low level height of the existing extensions, and would utilise a simple architectural language. The architectural and visual prominence of the Lodge and its association with the school would not be eroded as part of the works. As such the proposals are considered to have a neutral impact on the significance of the Lodge as well as the conservation area. It follows therefore, that the works would preserve the significance of both the Lodge and The Coombe Wood Conservation Area and not harm the significance of any heritage assets. The proposal would comply with Paragraphs 193 and 197 of the NPPF 2019, Policies 7.8 of the London Plan and CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r\rResidential Amenity:\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees: \rThe Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Where trees are to be lost through development the Council will normally require the planting of two specimens for each tree lost. The Council will refuse applications that adversely impact upon the leafy character of the Borough where commensurate appropriate replacement is not provided.\r\rThe Council's Trees and Landscape Officer raises no objection to the works provided they are carried out in accordance with the recommendations contained within the submitted arboricultural report prepared by Arborhelp dated 22 October 2020. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)\r\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling, located in the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area which derives its special architectural and historic interest as an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre  comprising of houses dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855.\r\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received,\r\rKingston Town Neighbourhhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection but has requested matching materials and conservation style rooflights.  Officers confirm that this would be secured by planning condition should permission be granted.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development and the impact on the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and  buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rPolicy DM12 is clear that the Council will: 'ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area' and preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed rear dormer is in general compliance with Policy 39 of residential design guide SPD. The rear dormer would not be highly visible within the street scene and would be a subordinate feature within the rear roof slope. It is therefore considered that the proposed dormer would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the rear dormer. The proposed roof lights would be of a conservation style and would fit flush with the roof slope; it is further noted that neighbouring properties have roof light windows on the front roof slopes. It is therefore considered that the proposed conservation style roof lights would not harm the character and appearance of the Conservation Area.\r\rThe proposed development would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area and no harm has been identifed, thereby complying with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would comply with Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended), Policies CS8, DM12 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012), the Residential Design SPD (2013) and the NPPF (2019).",
