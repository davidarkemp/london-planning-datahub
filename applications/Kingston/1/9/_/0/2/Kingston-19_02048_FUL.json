Any trees or shrubs which die during this period shall be replaced in the first available planting season, and the area shown to be landscaped shall be permanently retained for that purpose only.  \rReason: In the interests of visual amenity and also that the Local Planning Authority shall be satisfied as to the details of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The refuse storage facilities and recycling facilities shall be provided prior to the occupation of the development as shown on the approved plans and, such facilities shall be permanently retained at the site.\rReason: These details are required prior to commencement of development because the details would affect subsequent design of other elements of the scheme and must be agreed at the outset and to ensure the provision of refuse facilities to the satisfaction of the Council in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of a two storey side extension, a single storey rear extension, a single storey front extension, and 2no. dormers.\r\r5 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers are satisfied that the proposed single storey rear extension, single storey front extension, and dormers would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. However, the proposed two storey side extension would be set hard up against the boundary and would not be set down from the ridge of the main roof nor back from the front wall of the main part of the house. It would therefore fail to appear subordinate or proportionate and would unduly erode the gap to adjacent property, 9 Keswick Avenue. \r\rThe flank elevation would be topped by a large and unsightly parapet, which would project beyond the plane of both the front and rear roof slopes. The pitch of the roof would also be 45 degrees, where currently it is closer to 30 degrees. Together these aspects of the design would cause the side extension to appear as an incongruous feature within the Keswick Avenue street scene.\r\rIt is noted that 9 Keswick Avenue has implemented similar extensions. However, the two storey side element of these extensions is set down from the ridge of the main roof and set back from the front wall of the main part of the house (by 500mm in both cases). It is also set 1m in from the shared boundary and lacks the unsightly parapet seen in the current proposal.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, siting and design. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Noting the presence of the existing extensions at 9 Keswick Avenue and the fact that the proposal would pass the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest neighbouring habitable room windows, it is considered that the proposed development would not appear overbearing or result in any materially harmful loss of light to neighbouring occupiers. The proposed side facing dormer window would give rise to unacceptable views over 13 Keswick Avenue but this could be effectively mitigated through an obscure glazing condition. Subject to this condition, it is considered that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rOverall, officers conclude that the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Since there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, it is recommended that permission be refused.",
    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks a change to the finish of the flank wall of the single storey rear extension and alterations to the fenestration within the same elevation. Officers are satisfied that these changes would not have any material impact on the character and appearance of the area or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. Accordingly, the changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "The site comprises a three storey building on the corner of Thames Street and Bishops Hall. Part of the facade facing Thames Street (namely 11 Thames Street) is grade II listed.\r\rThe application seeks the like-for-like replacement of the existing shopfront doors and upper floor sash windows at 11 Thames Street. The shopfront at 11 Thames Street will also be generally refurbished, with any replacement materials to match the existing.\r\rKingston Town CAAC - Objection on the grounds of poor quality.\r\rOfficer response: Any replacement materials would be like-for-like and the appearance of the facade would not be altered in any way. The Chairman of the Neighbourhood Committee has authorised officers to determine the application under delegated powers.\r\rThe main issue in the assessment of this case is the impact on the listed building.\r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe application building is grade II listed. The significance of the building is as an attractive and reasonably well preserved mid 19th century building.\r\rThe proposal is for a refurbishment of the existing shopfront, which is in poor condition, and the replacement of the existing shopfront doors and upper floor sash windows. Any replacement materials used, including the shopfront doors and sash windows, would match the existing. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would preserve the historic fabric of the building and would not result in any harm to its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development is therefore considered to be in accordance with policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM12 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Accordingly, it is recommended that listed building consent be granted.",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rTwelve neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front porch is of similar design to the adjoining No. 4 Porchester Road. Officers acknowledge the use of render rather than brickwork to match the existing will effect the charater and appearance but would not be detrimental enough to warrent refusal.  The proposed side extension would be set back from the front elevation and is not considered to create an adverse impact on the Porcester Road streetscene. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the position of the proposed development and the orination of the site, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed hip-to-gable conversion would be small in scale and would be set back from the front roof slope, which would further limit its visual impact. It would be finished in materials to match the existing dwelling, including the ridge tiles which are an important characteristic feature. The increase to the height of the chimney would be negligible and would be barely noticeable to passers-by.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe site is located within the Park Road Conservation Area. The significance of the area can be summarised as an area of fine Victorian houses and local shops dating from 1890 -1900. \r\rAs noted above, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area. Officers are also of the view that the sympathetic design and use of materials would be suitably respectful of the historic character of the building and therefore that the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of the conservation area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the scale and siting of the proposed hip-to-gable, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light. The only new window to be inserted would be a roof light in the front roof slope which would only afford views over the front of the site and the public highway. An existing roof light in the side roof slope would be removed. It is therefore considered that the proposal would not result in any materially harmful loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

It is therefore considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would not involve any above ground structures being added to the site. It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rTrees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by TPOs are not adversely affected.\r\rThe site is subject to an area tree preservation order. The Council's Tree and Landscape Officer has confirmed that the proposed development would not encroach upon the root protection areas of any trees in the vicinity which are worthy of retention. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on trees.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rTen neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on flooding.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would measure approximately 5.4 metres in height to the eaves with a split gable end roof, approximately 6 metres in depth and 1.45 metres in width and would be set back 2 metres from the front elevation. The proposed roof form would relate well to the host property and would not exceed the ridge of the existing main roof, in accordance with Policy Guidance 36. It is considered that the proposed extensions would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  No. 94 and No. 98 Somerset Avenue are the principal properties to be considered in relation to amenity. With regards to No. 94 Somerset Avenue there would be no adverse impact due to the nature and siting of the proposals. Due to the limited depth of the proposed first floor side extension there would be no unacceptable loss of light to neighbouring habitable rooms of No.98 Somerset Avenue. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that the proposed extension would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
