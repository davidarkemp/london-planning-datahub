    "The proposed first floor front extension would disrupt the pattern of uniformity between the application property and the adjoining neighbouring properties. The proposed development would appear at odds with the immediate context of the site, and would have a harmful impact to the character of the host dwelling and the surrounding area. This would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policy Guidance 38 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "Any parking that cannot be contained within the site must park considerately and safely, so as not to obstruct sightlines at junctions or site accesses. The applicant should be aware that any such parking will cause unnecessary concern and agitation within the local community; Should make full use of the site accesses to maximise the availability of off street parking\r",
