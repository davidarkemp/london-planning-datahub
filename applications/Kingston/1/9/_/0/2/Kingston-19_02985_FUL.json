    "The proposal constitutes inappropriate development, which by definition is harmful to the Green Belt and to which is attributed substantial negative weight. There are no considerations which when taken individually or together would clearly outweigh the harm to the Green Belt so as to amount to very special circumstances. As such, the development is considered contrary to paragraph 147 and 148 of the NPPF (July 2021), Policy G3 of the London Plan (2021) and Policy CS3 of the RBK Core Strategy (2012) and the Planning Policy for Traveller Sites (2015).\r"
