    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission. \r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004. \r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r",
    "Prior to the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the first and second floor windows fitted in the side (south) elevation and the dormer window serving the ensuite shower room as shown on the approved drawings shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "The site comprises a  detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a single-storey side extension and rear \"piggyback\" roof extension with installation of 5no rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received relating to clarification of the wording set out in the Residential SPD and the submitted Design and Access Statement. Officers note that the use of boundary and property are interpreted to mean boundary for the purposes of assessing this application. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension would be set back sufficiently from the principal elevation, and be of a scale and depth that appears proportionate and in keeping with the host dwelling. The flat roof design whilst not reflective of the overall roof form, incorporates the existing banding and details of the existing building, utilises matching external materials, and would be subordinate to the host dwelling. It is further noted that the proposed extension would be slightly higher than the existing boundary treatment to the side of the property. Officers consider the development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rThe piggyback extension would be setback less than the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, however would match the setback of the piggyback extension to the neighbouring property at No. 32 Broomfield Road.  All other aspects of the piggyback design are considered acceptable in terms of eaves and ridge height, rooflights, distance from neighbouring dwellings and no inclusion of dormer windows. \r\rIt is further important to note the Appeal Decision at No 11 Broomfield - whereat the Inspector, in dealing with a 'piggy back' extension set back by 3m instead of 4m noted\r\r\"There would be conflict with the council's guidance for the set back from the front elevation for this type of roof extension.  however, there would be no significant harm to the character and appearance of the building and surrounding area from an extension with a 3 metre set back in the particular circumstances of this proposal.\"\r\rOfficers note that this does not necessarily set a precedent for future development however is highly material in this particular circumstance. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe proposed ground floor extension would align with the rear building line of the property at No.32 Broomfield Road and the existing rear extension to the application property.  No windows are proposed to the piggyback extension. As such, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3.\r\rOfficer comments: The proposed development would remove access to the rear of the property. Details of cycle parking provision will be secured by condition to ensure sustainable transport options are available.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.  \r\r\r\r",
    "Consultations\r13no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. No representations received.\r\rRBK Environmental Health Team\rNo response received.\r\rRBK Highways and Transportation Team\rNo response received.\r\rRBK Waste and Recycling Team\rNo response received.\r\rRBK Policy\rNo response received.\r\rPlanning History\rApplication reference: 20/02688/FUL - Erection of single storey house, with accommodation in the roofspace, on land adjacent to existing property, with associated amenity space, parking, cycle and refuse facilities. Refused planning permission on 31 December 2020. \r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a detached residential dwelling with associated parking, cycle store and refuse/recycling store. \r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located to the side of 97 Gainsborough Road, a residential dwellinghouse and curtilage. A side boundary of the site fronts onto Grange Road.\r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The site is not located in a conservation area and the building and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r-The principle of the development;\r-The standard of accommodation;\r-The character and appearance of the area;\r-The impact on neighbouring residential amenity;\r-Highways and transportation;\r-Waste and recycling;\r-Sustainability;\r-Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThe proposed development seeks to redevelop the site for residential use. \r\rThis application proposes 1no. additional residential unit, thereby making a small, but positive contribution towards these annual housing targets. In addition, the Council are currently unable to demonstrate a 5 year supply of land for the delivery of housing. As such, the 'tilted balance' and Paragraph 11(d) of the NPPF 2021 is a material planning consideration.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the proposed dwellinghouse to have 1 double-sized bedroom. \r\rAccording to the standard, a dwelling of this size should have a minimum GIA of 58sqm.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would have a GIA of approximately 52sqm, representing undersized accommodation. \r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for this size of dwelling is 1.5sqm. \r\rThe proposed dwelling would provide approximately 5.6sqm, in excess of minimum standards. \r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide two bedspaces, a double (or twin bedroom) has a floor area of at least 11.5m2. One double (or twin bedroom) is at least 2.75m wide. \r\rThe proposed bedroom would be compliant with these space standards. \r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated that 75% of the floorspace of the accommodation would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m, and officers are unable to determine this from the submitted plans.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be principally single aspect with windows mainly facing to the front, that is, orientated to the north. One small window is proposed to the side elevation (west) at first floor to serve the study room. This would result in poor outlook for the occupants. A Daylight / Sunlight Assessment has been undertaken and forms part of the application material. However, this assessment has only reviewed the impacts of the proposed development on neighbouring properties (both habitable rooms and amenity spaces), and has not demonstrated that the internal accommodation of the proposed dwelling, itself, would benefit from adequate daylight and sunlight exposure in accordance with BRE standards. Overall, the proposal is considered to represent a poor standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of the proposed dwelling.\r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have 50m2 of private outdoor space (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third).\r\rThe proposed dwelling would benefit from approximately 34sqm of private outdoor amenity space. When assessed against criteria for new houses, the quantum of amenity space provision would fall below guidance. The proposed configuration of the amenity space would be awkward and is considered overly contrived. \r\rOverall\rThe proposed dwelling would result in undersized accommodation, falling below the requirements of the nationally described space standard. It has not been possible from the submitted information for officers to determine that the ceiling heights would comply with policy. The proposed accommodation would be of a substandard nature by virtue of the single-aspect north-facing orientation and poor outlook. The applicant has failed to demonstrate within the submitted daylight/sunlight report that the future occupants of the proposed dwelling would have an adequate provision of daylight/sunlight. The outdoor amenity space would also be undersized and its layout is considered awkward in relation to the proposed dwelling. Overall, officers conclude that the proposed dwelling would offer a poor standard of accommodation.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. Development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r-Recognises distinctive local features and character\r-Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r-Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r-Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r-Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r-Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r-Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r-Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r-Landscape setting and features\r-Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r-Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r-Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges etc.\r\rThe application site currently serves to break up the built form between Gainsborough Road and Manor Drive North, providing visual relief. There is a general consistency to plot sizes and built form to the surrounding area. The introduction of built form would erode the spaciousness that the site provides and the proposed siting of the residential unit in relation to the donor plot and the run of properties along Gainsborough Road and Manor Drive North would result in an incongruous addition to the area. \r\rThe proposed development is not considered to respect the general pattern and form of development of the neighbouring properties. More specifically, it would not be in keeping with the proportions of the built form and their characteristic architectural features. The proposed new dwelling would have a shallow depth in a wide rectangular form, with a ridge height below the eaves of neighbouring properties. It is considered that the proposal would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and at odds with the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOverall, the proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r\r-A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r-A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r-Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r-In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rPolicy Guidance 17 and Policy Guidance 18 set out the Council's method for the assessment of daylight and sunlight. New development should be designed so that new buildings or extensions to existing buildings stand a reasonable distance from the boundary of the property so as not to block an unreasonable amount of light from any existing windows of neighbouring properties. As such, new development will be assessed against the 45degree and 25degree rules, as set out in the British Research Establishment's 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' 2011.\r\rPrivacy\rThere are no upper or lower floor windows proposed to the southern (rear) elevation. As such, the proposed development would not present opportunity for overlooking to the rear gardens of neighbouring properties. There is a single window proposed to the western (side) elevation at first floor which would serve a study room. Given the plot configuration, this window would not result in any loss of privacy to the nearest property to the west, No. 95 New Malden Drive.  \r\rOfficers are satisfied that the proposal would not give rise to any materially harmful loss of privacy.\r\rDaylight and Sunlight\rThe proposed development by virtue of its built footprint, and siting in relation to the neighbouring properties would not project further than the rear building line of the donor property, No 97 Gainsborough Road. \r\rA Daylight / Sunlight Report/Survey has been independently undertaken by a suitably qualified consultant which has assessed the impact of the proposed development on neighbouring properties. The report finds that the windows to the flank elevation of No. 95 Manor Drive Road would all be unaffected by the development proposals. Officers note that the windows to the flank elevation of No. 97 Gainsborough Road have not been tested as they relate to rooms which do not have a requirement to be assessed under BRE guidance (i.e. windows to non-habitable rooms, serving bathrooms or staircases). \r\rOverall, this is considered to be a satisfactory relationship.\r\rVisual Intrusion and Outlook\rThe proposed dwellinghouse is shown to be two-storeys. The proposed roof line would be set significantly lower than that of neighbouring properties. \r\rGiven the presence of an existing built structure on the site to a similar scale, albeit single-storey in height and used in ancillary capacity as storage and with no windows to habitable accommodation, and taking into account the proposed siting within the plot, the overall scale and massing of the proposed dwelling would not result in materially harmful impact on the outlook from No. 97 Gainsborough Road or No. 95 Manor Drive Road.\r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rAccess\rThe existing dropped kerb vehicular access to the application site would be utilised to serve the proposed dwelling and it is not considered that its use would materially intensify. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rHowever, the proposals do not show the corresponding change to the access, including the need for a new vehicular dropped kerb, to serve the proposed off-street car parking provision for the donor property, No. 97 Gainsborough Road. This is required to be explicitly shown in the application proposals.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 2 (poor). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum car parking provision in Outer London areas with a PTAL 2-3 of up to 0.75 spaces per dwelling for 1-2 bedroom units.\r\rThe proposed plans show that 2no. off-street car parking spaces would be provided to the front of the dwelling. This therefore represents an overprovision that would encourage vehicle use. In turn this could lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards. Development proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for two cycle parking spaces. It is proposed that 2no. cycle spaces be provided within the front garden area. This is considered an acceptable position, subject to design of an enclosure for the cycles, details of which would have been secured by way of condition should the recommendation have been for approval. \r\rWaste and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rWhere containers need to be permanently stored to the front of a property, they should be housed in dedicated storage structures, which should be sited sensitively and where appropriate, well screened and appropriately landscaped so as to preserve and enhance the character of the street scene. In general, waste stores, typically containers, should not be sited to project forward of the established building line. A dedicated waste store should be constructed of materials appropriate to its context, particularly where the development site is in a sensitive location, for example a conservation area.\r\rBin storage is shown to the front garden area. The position is considered appropriate, subject to design of the enclosure, details of which would have been secured by way of condition should the recommendation have been for approval.\r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2021 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy SI2 of the London Plan 2021 requires all new major developments to be zero carbon. However, it does not set any requirements for minor developments.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency and CO2 reductions. \r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The development is liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 4, for which the charge is £50 per square metre. \r\rThe payment of CIL is a material consideration in determining planning applications because it will provide for new infrastructure to mitigate any associated impacts arising from the development.\r\rConclusion\rThe application has failed to satisfactorily address or overcome the previous reasons for refusal under application reference: 20/02688/FUL. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rSignificant weight is given in the assessment of the proposals providing for one net additional residential dwellinghouse. \rHowever, Officers find that the proposed development would provide for poor living accommodation for future occupiers of the property, in terms of presenting as a single-aspect, north facing dwelling with restricted outlook and natural daylight/sunlight ingress. There is insufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed accommodation would meet the internal space standards with particular regard to floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation. In addition, the proposed private outdoor amenity space is undersized at 34sqm in relation to criteria set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD, and would be of an awkward configuration in relation to the proposed dwelling.\r\rThe proposed development by virtue of its plot subdivision and lack of ground would present as an uncharacteristically over dense pocket in the area, with a cramped appearance of overdevelopment.\r\rThe proposed level of parking represents an overprovision that would encourage vehicle use. In turn this could lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rIn conclusion and on balance, the delivery of one additional 1-bedroom residential dwelling is considered not to demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits associated with standards of living accommodation, design, character and appearance and highways and transportation. \r\rAccordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",

    "Please provide a copy of proposed block plan scaled 1:500, providing a scale bar showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.",
    "Please provide copies of all existing and proposed front and rear elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.\r\rThe scale bars in the submitted existing and proposed front and rear elevations do not measure to the stated scale."
