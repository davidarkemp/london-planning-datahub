    "The proposed single storey side extension by virtue of its design, bulk and position; would prejudice the neighbouring amenities of no.26 Grand Avenue, particularly the side elevation bedroom window at the ground floor level; by way of loss of daylight/sunlight and outlook. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
