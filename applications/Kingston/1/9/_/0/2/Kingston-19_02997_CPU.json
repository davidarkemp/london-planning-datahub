    "The proposed extensions and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B & C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The site comprises an end-terrace dwelling.\r\rIn response to neighbour notification, a total of 2x letters have been received from the same address raising the following comments:\r- The existing Eucalyptus tree approximately 25ft away from the proposed extension could harm the roots of this tree and lead to it toppling onto neighbouring properties.\r\rOfficer comment: The tree in question is not protected and it  is not considered that the proposed single storey rear extension of a depth of approximately 3.5m would have any direct or demonstrable adverse impact on this tree. It is not considered reasonable or necessary to require full Arboricultural Information for this proposal.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would incorporate a 1m set-back from the north-west boundary of the site and would be set-down from the ridge of the main roof by a minimum of 0.5m. The hipped-roof form would relate well to that of the existing dwelling while the single storey rear extension is of a relatively modest depth and would not be highly visible within the street scene. The proposed extensions are therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of character and appearace and that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed first floor side extension would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy due to the substantial set-back from the site boundary and neighbouring properties. The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a maximum depth of 3.5m (as shown on the Proposed Ground Floor Plan) which would be approximately 1.5m greater in depth than the existing extension it would replace. The submitted Block Plan submitted on 25.11.20 would appear to inaccurately depict the proposed extension when compared to the submitted Floor and Elevation Plans.\r\rAdjoining No. 57 Church Road would appear to have a door on the rear elevation closest to the proposed development with a habitable room window beyond. The set-back from the neighbouring habitable room window and the relatively modest depth of the proposed single storey rear extension is considered sufficient to ensure no significant adverse impact on the amenities of No. 57.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Please provide a copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline.\r\rKindly note that the block plan should also show a red line around the application site"
