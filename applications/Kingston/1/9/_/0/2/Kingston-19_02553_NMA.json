    "It is likely that the proposed amendments would have a significant effect on the safety and operation of the highway network, as well as the character and appearance of the area. Therefore, the proposed amendments are considered not to be non-material, as they would require a full assessment in terms of compliance with policies CS7, CS8, DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "Unless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
