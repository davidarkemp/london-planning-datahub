    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral comment has been received. The neutral comment raised queries regarding access/traffic and car parking and how that may affect the residents of Hatton House to the rear of the site.\r\rIn this case and for the avoidance of doubt the proposed development is not seeking to use the land to the rear of the site for parking, or as a builders yard. Neither is the proposed development seeking to alter, or impede access to neighbouring properties. As such, these matters will not be considered as part of this assessment. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed development would result in some loss of light to the rear facing, ground floor level window of the neighbouring property, No. 39A Hawks Road, it is understood that this is not a principal habitable room window.  Due to the separation distance between neighbouring property, No. 39C Hawks Road and the majority of the proposed extensions and alterations in this case, it is considered that there would be no unacceptable adverse amenity impact. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached three-storey dwelling located on the southern side of St Andrew's Square, Surbiton.\r\rThe application property is locally listed and is located within the St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a rear extension situated off the stair landing between first and second floor.\r\rConsultation\r19no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): Objection on the grounds that the submitted drawings were of poor quality.  \rOfficer Comment:  Despite this objection and in accordance with the Council's constitution, the Chair of the Surbiton Neighbourhood Committee has authorised that this decision can be made under delegated authority.\r\rPlanning History\r21/01750/HOU - Demolition of existing rear WC and erection of single-storey rear infill extension with associated changes to fenestration.  Installation of 2no new windows to side dormer. Formation of new front boundary wall with railings. Granted planning permission, dated 27 July 2021.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact upon heritage assets; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would have an approximate depth of 2.5m, an approximate width of 3.6m, and approximate maximum height of 2.75m and an approximate eaves height of 1.9m. The overall height when measured from the ground level would be approximately 8.9m. The extension would not be visible from the street, and so the main consideration is the impact of the extension on the character and appearance of the application property.\r\rThe proposed extension would be set back significantly from the rear elevation of the existing outrigger and set down significantly from the existing main roof pitch. The pitched roof design is considered to be in keeping with that of the dwellinghouse.\r\rOfficer's consider the extension would appear suitably subordinate to the application property and, subject to the materials matching the application property, would likely consider the proposal to be acceptable on the grounds of character and appearance.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposed extension would be sited at the rear of the property and would not be visible from the street. There are rooflights proposed on the extension, which would be small and have been specified within the revised roof plan (dwg ref: StAS_104_Rev P3) as aluminium conservation-type rooflights. The scale and design of the extension would be suitably subordinate to the character of the application property, and the design and materiality would be in keeping. It is considered that the proposals would not result in any harm to the character and appearance or significance of the designated heritage asset, being that of St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe extension would be relatively modest in terms of its increase in the massing to the building and no side elevation windows are proposed. The proposals are considered not to result in any undue material impacts in terms of loss of privacy, overbearing or overlooking. \r\rIt is also noted that a separate planning application has been submitted and approved for similar proposals in relation to the neighbouring property, No. 32 St. Andrew's Square (reference: 21/02992/HOU). \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. It would not result in any harm to the significance of heritage assets. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.",
    "Site\rThe application site is a large two-storey semi-detached dwellinghouse located on Balaclava Road. The site is located within a Controlled Parking Zone, as well as the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area. \r\rConsultations\r19 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConservation Areas Advisory Committee - Objection. We object to this application as there is not sufficient information provided on proposed materials. The application form states 'refer to plan' but there is no / little info on materials listed on the drawings. All materials should be appropriate for use in the CA. \rOfficer Comment: Whilst the CAAC has objected to the proposals the Chair of the Surbiton Neighbourhood Committee has authorised officers to deal with the application under delegated authority as per the Council's constitution.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe impact of the development on character and appearance; \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \rThe impact of the development on the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area ( a designated heritage asset).\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a single storey rear extension. Single storey rear extensions should be designed so that they appear proportionate and subordinate to the host building. The proposed extension would measure approximately 5.3 metres in depth and would have a flat roof, measuring approximately  3.9 metres in height. Policy Guidance 33 Single Storey Rear Extensions of the Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should generally not exceed 3-3.5 metres in depth. It also states that flat roofed rear extensions should measure a maximum of 3 metres in height. However, whilst the proposed extension exceeds the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, due to the sunstantial scale of the existing house, the proposed extension would still appear proportionate and subordinate in relation to the dwelling. The proposed would therefore have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal properties to consider in relation to amenity are Nos. 24 & 28 Balaclava Road. Both of these neighbouring properties have single storey rear extensions. Therefore, whilst the proposed extension would be large in scale, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rThe significance and special architectural and historic interest of the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area can be summarised as: An area of several cohesive groups of two storey red brick houses built between 1893 and 1904. The proposed development would still retain the cohesive frontage of the dwellinghouse. As such, the proposed would likely have an acceptable impact on the conservation area and would not result in any harm to its significance. However, due to the limited information submited in relation to the proposed materials and to ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development, officers consider it appropriate to attach a condition for details of the materials used in the proposed development to be provided to the Local Planning Authority for written approval.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The assessment of this application has been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans.

If you carry out development based on incorrect plans you may be liable to the Council taking enforcement action against you.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r23 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed first floor side extension would be set back from the front elevation, it would have a flat roof which would not appear in keeping with the existing roof form. It would also be clad in timber and feature windows that would not appear in keeping with the original dwelling. Given that the proposal would not adhere to the recommendations as set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013 in terms of design and materials, officers consider that the proposed development would detract from the character of the original building. Further, given the siting of the dwelling, the proposed extension would appear prominently within the streetscene.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst the proposed extension, given the connection to the existing outbuilding, would not adhere to the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD 2013, given the context of the site and the existing developments / extensions, it is concluded that the proposed development is  acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAs stated above, Officers have concluded that there would be no adverse impact upon character and appearance. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Berg Estate LASC.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling and linked dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a single-storey rear extension and a hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with the installation of 2no front rooflights to facilitate a loft conversion.\r\rConsultation\r8x properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rPlanning History\r21/01566/CPU Erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension, Granted August 2021.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that a similar hip to gable roof extension has been implemented at neighbouring property, No.40 Ancaster Crescent (ref. 13/14336/LDP). The hip to gable roof extension and rear dormer being considered in this case would not strictly accord with the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD, 2013. However, they would be in keeping with the character of the original dwelling and achieve an element of symmetry with the neighbouring property at No.40. The proposed rear/side ground floor extension would conform with the guidance set out in the Residential Design SPD. Therefore, overall, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area, caused by any part of the proposal.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposed ground floor side/rear extension, which would include a flat roof element, would extend a maximum of 3.25 metres to the rear of the original house and would accord with the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD. Whilst the proposed rear dormer would afford some views into neighbouring gardens, this relationship would be typical of the suburban pattern of development. It is considered therefore, that the proposed development would not affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties to an unacceptable degree by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached three-storey dwelling located on the southern side of St Andrew's Square, Surbiton.\r\rThe application property is locally listed and is located in the St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. \r\rProposal\rThe application seeks planning permission for the erection of a second floor rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r3no. properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Advisory Committee (CAAC): No representation received.\r\rPlanning History\r21/01689/PRE - Advice for a first floor rear extension. Advice provided by Council on 2 September 2021.\r15/16439/HOU - Erection of a single storey rear infill extension. Planning permission granted on 22 September 2015. \r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact on the character and appearance of the area; \r- The impact upon heritage assets; and\r- The impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would have an approximate depth of 2.5 - 2.9m, an approximate width of 3.6m, an approximate maximum height of 2.75m and an approximate eaves height of 1.9m. The overall height when measured from the ground level would be approximately 8.9m. The extension would not be visible from the street. \r\rThe proposed extension would be set back significantly from the rear elevation of the existing outrigger and set down significantly from the existing main roof pitch. The pitched roof design is considered to be in keeping with that of the host dwellinghouse.\r\rOfficers consider the extension would appear suitably subordinate to the application property. The materials to be used in the extension would match those found elsewhere on the property and so officers find the proposals to be acceptable on the grounds of character and appearance. There are no changes to the front elevation of the property.\r\rImpact upon Heritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rThe proposed extension would be sited at the rear of the property and would not be visible from the street. There are rooflights proposed on the extension, which would be small and have been specified within the application form as aluminium conservation-type rooflights. The scale and design of the extension would be suitably subordinate to the character of the application property, and the design and materiality would be in keeping. The proposals do not change the front facade of the property. It is considered that the proposals would not result in any harm to the character and appearance or significance of the non-designated locally listed building, or the designated heritage asset, being that of St Andrew's Square Conservation Area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe extension would be relatively modest in terms of its increase to the massing of the building and no side elevation windows are proposed. The proposals are considered not to result in undue material impacts in terms of loss of privacy, overbearing or overlooking, or loss of light. \r\rIt is noted that a separate planning application has been submitted for No. 33 for the same proposals as those under consideration in this application to No. 32 (that is, under application reference: 21/03372/HOU). \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of residential amenity.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. It would not have any impact on the significance of heritage assets. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.",
