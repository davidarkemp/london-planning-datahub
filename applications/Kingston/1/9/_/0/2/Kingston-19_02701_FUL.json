The developer and/or their successors in title shall take all reasonable steps to ensure that all refuse and recyclable materials associated with the development are either stored within these facilities or internally within the building(s) on the application site, and that no refuse or recycling material is stored or placed for collection on the public highway except on the day of collection.\r\rReason: To ensure proper waste management in the interests of the character and appearance of the area and the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policies 5.17 and 7.4 of the London Plan 2016 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",

Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3.\r\rReason: To ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers, in accordance with policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a mid terrace dwelling.\r\rTwo neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Whilst it is acknowledged that the proposal would exceed the recommended depths for single storey rear extensions as set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD, the proposed development would not be visible from the street and would not have an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.  As such, the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height and design. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal would fail the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest habitable room window at No. 198 Canbury Park Road. The extension would be particularly deep, and it would be sited hard up against the shared boundary. On this basis, it is considered that the proposed development would be unneighbourly and would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of No. 198 Canbury Park Road as it would create an undue sense of enclosure and result in an unacceptable loss of sunlight/daylight and outlook. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "Officers considers that the proposed increase in depth would have a material impact on neighbouring amenity. As such, it  would represent a material amendment to the original permission i.e. would widen the scope of the planning permission and as such the application is refused.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the existing car parking facilities. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed conversion of the garage would involve raising the height of the garage to match the height of the existing porch. The proposed roof would follow the existing roof line of the porch and therefore be-in keeping with the host dwelling. It is considered that there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene that has examples of the similar proposals. \r\rThe proposed infill side extension due to its modest scale, siting, design and materials would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling, in accordance  with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given its modest scale (eaves height approx. 2.75m) and siting, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "It is considered that the proposed amendments to the outbuilding consisting of installation of pitched roof (total height of approx. 3.5m) with rooflights and alterations to the fenestration on the front elevation would be minor in scale and would not have any significant impact or result in a material change in terms of character and appearance or neighbouring residential amenities. The proposed amendments would not have significant impact on Metropolitan Open Land due to its modest scale and the existing boundary treatment comprising mature trees.",
