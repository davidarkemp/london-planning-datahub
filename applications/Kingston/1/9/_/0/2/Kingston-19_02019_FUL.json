    "The proposed development by virtue of the scale, form, location, layout and design of the dwelling would result in an incongruous form of development that would erode the established character of the area. As such, the proposed development would result in the inappropriate development of garden land reducing the role such land can play in reinforcing suburban character, and would therefore be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed development would provide an inadequate level of private amenity space to serve this residential unit. Furthermore the development does not provide ceiling heights of at least 2.3m for 75% of the floor area of the residential unit. As such the scheme would result in a sub-standard level of living accommodation contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed development does not make adequate provision for on site parking to serve the development and would result in overspill parking on surrounding streets leading to increased parking stress and potential highway safety concerns. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS6 and DM09 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "You have been granted planning permission to build a residential extension.  When undertaking demolition and/or building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  Furthermore, please ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction of the development hereby approved are properly washed and cleaned to prevent the passage of mud and dirt onto the adjoining highway. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation.  For further information and advice, please contact - Environmental Health Department Pollution Section.",
    "The proposed extension and alterations are considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Please can you clarify the site address on your covering letter to the site address on your application, as there appear to be different.",
    "Please revise and resubmit a copy of an Ordnance Survey based site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red and adjoining land owned by applicant in blue.\r\rPlease note the red outline should include the area of the crossover.",
    "Please complete the appropriate application form which can be downloaded from our website http://www.planningportal.gov.uk/planning/applications/howtoapply/permissiontypes\r\rPlease note that as this site location consists of a flat, please complete a \"FUL\" planning application form and also complete Certificate B."
