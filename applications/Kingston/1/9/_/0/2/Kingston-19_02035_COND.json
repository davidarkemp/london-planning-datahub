Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action.",

The works are likely to aid the tree health in the long term and offer no negative impact upon health or public amenity.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove."
