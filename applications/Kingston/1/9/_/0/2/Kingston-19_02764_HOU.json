    "The proposed two storey side/rear extension by reason of its poor design which includes; the absence of a 1.0m set in from the east boundary; the absence of a 0.5m dropped roofline and the use of an unsympathetic roof design; would be a disproportionate addition and would visually erode the separation gap between properties. It is considered the proposal would be indicative of an insensitive form of terrace development which would be at odds with the character and appearance of the application dwelling and the streetscene of Clayton Road. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
