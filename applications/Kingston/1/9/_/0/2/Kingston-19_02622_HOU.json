    "The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its poor design which includes; the absence of a 0.5m front elevation setback and the use of a flat roof; would be a disproportionate and insubordinate addition which would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would be at odds with the character of the main dwelling and the character and appearance of The Drive LASC. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r",
    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its poor design and detailing which includes; the use of a flat roof; the use of brickwork to the first floor elevations; and the use of a glass link feature; would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would be at odds with the character of the main dwelling and the character and appearance of The Drive LASC. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
