    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: As required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990, as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "A sample of the facing materials to be utilised in the development hereby permitted (including bricks, roof tiles and windows) shall be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority prior to above ground works. The development shall then be built in accordance with these approved samples. \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or reenacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in the flank walls of the extension hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments, including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012. \r\r",
    "The roof of the extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "The site comprises a mid terrace dwelling.\r\rFour neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling. The application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). \r\rOfficers note planning permission has previously been granted on site re. 16/16219/HOU for the demolition of the existing lean to extension and the erection of a single storey side and rear extension. The current application is a resubmission of the aforementioned permission and seeks changes to the design of the proposed roof. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:  It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to recommended depths. However, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling. The proposed hipped roof would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and therefore acceptable. \r\rGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that the adjoining properties benefit from single storey rear extensions. Due to the site context, the modest height of the proposed extension and its siting, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that the proposed extension would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would be implemented as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8, DM4 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The assessment of this application is based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should generally be no more than 3m to 3.5m in depth. Policy Guidance 35 states that single storey side extensions should generally be set back from the front wall of the original house by 500mm. In this case, the proposed rear extension would extend beyond the original rear wall of the dwelling by approximately 5.1m and the side extension would not be set back at all from the original front wall. However, having regard to the scale of the original house and the presence of the single storey rear extension at No.79 Beresford Avenue, officers are satisfied that the proposed rear extension would appear as a subordinate and proportionate addition to the dwelling. Officers are also mindful of the presence of other single storey side extensions in the immediate vicinity which are not set back from the original front walls of their hosts (notably Nos. 83, 87 and 91 Beresford Avenue) and on this basis, officers conclude that this conflict with the Council's guidance would not, in this case, result in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: In light of the presence of the existing single storey rear extension at No. 79 Beresford Avenue, officers are satisfied that the proposed extension would not appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to the occupiers of this property. No. 83 Beresford Avenue does not benefit from any rear extensions, so the proposed extension would project approximately 5.1m beyond its rear building line. However, it would be separated from the boundary by approximately 700mm and the eaves would be set at a relatively modest height of approximately 2.8m. In light of this, officers conclude that on balance, the proposal would not appear overbearing or result in materially harmful loss of light to the occupiers of this property. The proposal would not introduce any new windows at first floor level or above and so would have a negligible impact on privacy. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016), and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "You have provided a chair plan for the outside of the property where the extension has been built for the cafe, however a site plan is required to show the area as pre-existing (to scale)",
    "Both existing and proposed plans and elevations must be provided",
    "Plans provided are again invalid.\r\rSite Location and Site Plans must contain red outlie.\r\rThe area of pavement where the dropped kerb is to be formed must be included in the red outline",
    "Please confirm description of works as the application form description does not correspond with the proposed works in the plans and/or supporting documents.  Confirmation can be in writing or by amending the plans to reflect the proposals.\r\rNote: Any documentation with the incorrect proposals will need to be resubmitted, this includes the description of works section on the application form."
