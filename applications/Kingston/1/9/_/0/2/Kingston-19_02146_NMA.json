    "The tree plan you have provided cannot be opened or viewed in the format in which it arrived with us, please provide the tree plan in an alternative format ensuring it is as follows:\r\rA plan or sketch showing the location of the trees within the site or immediately adjoining the site.",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the windows subject to the NMA application shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way. We have made available detailed advice in the form of our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. However the amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe tree is to the very rear of the property and its removal will not affect public amenity within the Conservation Area. It is not a large specimen and it is showing some signs of stress including dieback in the upper crown and heavy epicormic basal growth.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",
