    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the windows serving the rooms labelled as 'shower', 'ensuite' and 'bathroom' on drawing number 204902 Rev D shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable.  Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The roof of the single storey rear extension element hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r\r",
    "",
    "Policy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy and paragraph 109 of the NPPF supports this stance . \r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the proximity of the proposed vehicular access to the junction of Elmdene the proposal is likely to have an unacceptable impact upon highway safety, thereby conflicting with Policy DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy and paragraph 109 of the NPPF.\r\rThe proposed dropped kerb would encroach within the 10 metre junction protection area for the junction with Elmdene as detailed in the RBK Crossover Policy 2020 and as such is considered to be unacceptable for a new dropped kerb on grounds of highway safety (NPPF, para. 109).\r",
    "The site comprises a linked dwelling.\r\r1 letter of objection has been received raising the following points\r\r1) The in-combination impact of the proposed outbuilding with extant permission for a single storey rear extension (20/03043/HOU), on the amenity of neighbouring properties\r2) Impact on daylight and sunlight\r3) Design\r\rThe application proposes the erection of a single storey outbuilding in the rearmost area of the garden space serving 114 Durlston Road. The outbuilding would comprises an approx square building approx 6m x 6m, 2.6m high. The building would follow the boundary with No 116. A space would be retained to the boundary with No 112 to provide rear access. It is proposed that the Outbuilding would be used as an ancillary office. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: In terms of design the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. The points raised by the objector are acknowledged, however it is noted that outbuildings of this size are not uncommon in the immediate area. As such, It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe building would occupy approx 36sqm of the rearmost portion of the garden area, when taking account of the approved single storey rear extension there would be sufficient amenity space for occupants of the host dwelling.\r\rThe in combination impact of the development has been assessed by officers, it is noted that if approved there would be a boundary feature along the boundary with No 114 in excess of 2m for approx 12m (split in 2 relatively equal sections with approx 10m between) whilst this would exceed the height of a traditional fence at 2m it would do by 1m for the section associated with the single storey extension and 0.6m for the outbuilding section. Officers consider that the section associated with the outbuilding would have a negligible impact on the level of daylight and sunlight enjoyed in the neighbouring rear garden, and would not be overbearing. \r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe objection received has been carefully considered, however, it is concluded that the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
