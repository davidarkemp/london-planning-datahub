    "The site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\r9 surrounding properties were notified of the proposal. One objection was received, relating to impacts to trees, loss of light/sunlight, loss of privacy, excessive height and bulk of buildings.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Parking\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers comment: The proposed two storey side extension would be set back by 1m by the front elevation and 0.8m from the boundary with no.21, which is less than what is recommended by the Residential Design Guide SPD for two storey side extensions. Within the area there is a mixture of terraced and semi-detached houses; the semi-detached dwellings all retain relatively uniform gaps between the boundaries, including neighbouring property no.21 with a separation distance of 1.1m. \r\rOfficers also note that the proposed two storey side extension would be a similar width to the original dwelling. Side extensions should be subservient to the original dwelling, and as there are no extensions of a similar scale in the area it is considered that the proposed extension would be out of keeping with the surrounding area. The roof form for the two storey side extension would be set down from the existing roof and thus be subservient to the applicants dwelling. \r\rThe rear extension would have a depth of 4m and a flat roof with a height of 3.15m to the eaves. While the depth would be in scale with the detached dwelling the height would be excess of that recommended by the Residential Design Guide SPD which proposes flat roofs to be a maximum height of 3m. \r\rGiven the width of the two storey side extension, proximity of the rear/side extension to No.21 Kings Avenue, and height of the single storey rear/side extension it is considered that the development would create an incongruous addition to the existing dwelling and surrounding area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is not considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\r\rThe single storey side extension would be set back from the boundary with No.21 Kings Avenue by 0.8 metres and extend the full depth of the dwelling, with an additional 4m extension to the rear. The height of the side and rear extension would be 3.15m with a flat roof, over what is recommended by the Residential Design Guidelines SPD. Although the rear extension would be of a modest depth for a detached dwelling, neither adjoining properties to the applicants property benefit from existing extensions, and are already set back from the line of the existing rear of the applicants property. \r\rEven though the rear development has an excessive height, it is unlikely that No. 15 Kings Avenue would be unduly affected by the proposed development given that there is an existing outbuilding that borders the applicants property and would adjoin the proposed rear extension and limit any impact to loss of amenity. However, the proposed developments would be coming in close proximity to the boundary with No. 21 Kings Avenue, and given the depth of the side and rear extension combined, would ultimately result in a feeling of overbearing. Further, given the depth, height and proximity of the developments it is not likely that the development would pass the 45 degree test resulting in a loss of sunlight and outlook for the neighbouring property.\r\rThe two storey side extension has windows which are obscure glazed and are non openable below 1.7m from first floor landing, limiting the impact of overlooking to neighbouring property No. 21 Kings Avenue. However, given the proximity of the development to the boundary line, it is likely that there would be adverse impacts to sunlight and overbearing for neighbouring property No. 21 Kings Avenue. \r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely  affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer comment: Permeable block paving is proposed to replace the existing hard standing to the front of the applicants property. A dropped kerb is also proposed to add one new parking space. A street tree is located to the front of the property in close proximity to the proposed dropped kerb, and given its close proximity to the proposed development it is likely to have to be removed if permission was granted. Given that the Sustainable Transport SPD advises against the felling of street trees, the proposed dropped kerb would not comply with recommendations as set out in this SPD. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be excessive and incongruous and would not relate well to the host dwelling or the surrounding area, resulting in harm to the character and appearance of the area. The proposed development would also result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of loss of sunlight/light and a sense of overbearing for both neighbouring properties. Further, given the impact the dropped kerb would have to the street tree to the front of the property, the proposal is therefore contrary to Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a rear outrigger according to council records.  The proposed extension would therefore extend beyond the side elevation of the outrigger and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) and (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended) and would require planning permission.\r",
    "The proposals also show works which may fall outside the parameters of permitted development such as amendments to the fenestration on the first floor. It is also not clear if any excavation works would be required as part of the changes shown to the basement on the proposed floor plans.",
