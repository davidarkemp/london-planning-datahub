    "The proposed monopole, antennas, along with the proliferation of associated equipment, by reason of their collective bulk, scale, design and prominent location on a busy junction, would represent incongruous and jarring features which would have a detrimental impact on character and appearence of the area, moreover, they would prejudice the Council's future development plans for the site to create a pocket park. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation. These cover such works as - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works. Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts. A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced. \r",
    "Please provide a copy of an revised block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site."
