    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r14 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the proposed piggy back extension would be clearly visible when viewed from the north-west of Bond Street, as it is the corner plot and it would appear highly prominent in the streetscene. However, the set back from the front elevation of the house is by at least 4m, it would use materials and detailing that would match the original house, it would not increase the height of the eaves and ridge by more than 1.3m and it would respect the roof design of the main dwelling.  \r\rAdditionally, officers note that No.31 Bond Street benefits from a similar piggyback extension, therefore piggyback extensions are not incongruous in the immediate vicinity of Bond Street. Furthermore, it is noted that bulky dormers in the area can be seen from Bond Street, No.27 Bond Street has the benefit of dormers on the sides of the roof through permitted development which would appear bulky and excessively prominent. It is noted that permitted development rights at the application property appear to be intact and similar roof extensions could be possible in this case.\r\rWith regard to the first-floor rear extension, it would not be highly visible or incongruous when viewed from Bond Street. Additionally, it would appear modest in scale and subordinate to the host dwelling. \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would not be an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed development would not cause a significant loss of light to neighbouring property No.29 Bond Road. The proposed first-floor rear extension would be located on the flat roof area of the existing single-storey rear extension which would not surpass the rear wall of No.29 Bond Road. Planning permission ref: 05/16550/FUL demonstrates that the first-floor rear wall at No.29 extends past the rear wall of No.27 by approximately 2m and the proposed first-floor rear extension would have a depth of approximately 1.6m. \r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement and the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and Officers consider that the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A) could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultations \rNo response received \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Other matters\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The porposed development would not fully follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD. However in this instance in the context of the site and its surroundings it is considered the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\rThe application is supported by a deposited fire strategy. However it is considered that this does not clearly demonstrate how the proposed development would accord with Policy D12 of the London Plan. Therefore a condition is recommended to secure a detailed fire safety strategy to ensure that the proposed development would accord with London Plan Policy D12 (fire safety).\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

Whilst there is likely to be some additional shadowing as a result of the proposed development it is considered that this would not be to a degree that would cause undue harm or diminish the existing living conditions of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rOther matters\rThe application is supported by a deposited fire strategy. It is considered given the nature of the proposed development and site that this covers the requirements of Policy D12 of the London Plan in regards to fire safety. A condition is recommended to secure that the proposed development be carried out and thereafter maintained/operated in accordance with the deposited fire statement \r\rThe proposal would increase the number of bedrooms but not the residential units on the site and it is considered that the proposal would not lead to a significant increase in demand for on or off street parking or lead to congestion or prejudice highway safety.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service.

However the proposal is of a similar character and appearance to that of the adjoining semi-detached property 2 Matlock Way. On balance it is considered that as such given the context of its surroundings and in particular the attached adjoining semi-detached property the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be in keeping with the general pattern and form of development of the surrounding area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters \rIn the context of the site and the nature of the development it is considered the fire statement deposited in support of the application would be sufficient to accord with the fire safety requirements set out in Policy D12 of the London Plan.

    "The site comprises a detached dwellinghosue. The site is located within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character, a non-designated heritage asset.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRichmond Council - No objection.\r\rRelevant Planning History\r\r- 23/01326/HOU - Demolition of the existing front porch, side extension and rear garage, erection of two storey side and rear extension with balcony to the rear, and erection of single storey front porch extension.

Erection of roof extension and installation of 5 nos side and 1 no front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion. Alteration to fenestration. Approved 01 Dec 2022.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application follows the refusal of planning application ref: 23/01326/HOU. The first reason for refusal is as follows:\r\r'1. The proposed balcony would appear incongruous and result in a discordant feature to the host dwelling and surrounding area. The proposals would detract from the character and appearance of the existing dwelling and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill strategic Area of Special Character resulting in unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the dwelling and the area. The proposal would conflict with Policies D3 & HC1 of the London Plan 2021, paragraphs 199 to 208 of the NPPF 2021 and Policies CS8, DM10 & DM12 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.'\r\rThe main changes between the refused scheme and the current proposals include: a reduction in depth of the single storey rear extension of approximately 0.15m; and the removal of the first floor rear facing balcony area and its replacement with a non-accessible flat roof area and guard railing 0.15m from the proposed fenestration.\r\rIt is considered that the removal of the first floor rear facing balcony addresses the first reason for refusal. As a whole, it is considered that the proposed extensions and alterations to the dwelling would be of a high quality and would not cause any harm to the character and appearance of the area. While the proposed timber cladding and standing seam metal for the roof are not characteristic of the existing dwelling, it is noted that neighbouring properties incorporate similarly contemporary materials. Subject to a condition requiring further details of the proposed materials, including samples, to be submitted, Officers are satisfied that the development would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The second reason for refusal of planning application ref: 23/01326/HOU is as follows:\r\r'2. By reason of height and sitting, the proposed balcony would result in unacceptable overlooking and a loss of privacy to the closest neighbouring properties, contrary to Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.'\r\rThe revised scheme has removed the first floor balcony from the scheme and incorporates a balustrade to prevent access to the flat roof area. Subject to the proposed arrangement being secured by way of a planning condition Officers are satisfied that the amended scheme fully addresses the overlooking and loss of privacy identified in the second reason for refusal.\r\rThe proposals include a clear glazed first floor bedroom window on the side elevation facing towards No. 36 Upper Park Road. However, given that there is an existing habitable room at the application site which appears to be clear glazed and that it would not directly face any habitable room windows at No. 36, it is considered unnecessary to secure the proposed window as obscure glazed and non-opening.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not have any unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring amenity when compared to the existing situation.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2023 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rAs set out above, it is considered that there would be no adverse impact in terms of character and appearance as a result of the proposals.  Therefore, it follows that there would be no harm to the significance of the non-designated heritage asset, the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

    "The site comprises an end-terraced dwelling.\r\r10 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed dormer would not strictly comply with Residential Design SPD in regards to retaining 500mm distance from the sides, eaves and ridge of the roof and would not mimic or resemble the existing pitched roof form but rather proposes a flat roof. However, it would not be highly prominent within the street scene and it is noted that dormers of a similar form and scale have been built in the wider area. Furthermore, it is likely that a hip to gable and rear dormer extension could be accomplished via permitted development rights. Within this context, on balance, it is considered that this element of the proposal would be acceptable.\r\rThe Residential Design SPD states that proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of the property and neighbouring properties. Additionally, hip-to-gable extensions are not prominent in the vicinity of Hemsby Road but would not appear to be an incongruous feature as neighbouring property 17 Hemsby Road also benefits from a similar development. \r\rOverall, officers note that the proposed hip-to-gable/dormer roof extension would not fully comply with the requirements of the Residential Design SPD, as it would slightly upset the symmetry in the streetscene. However, given that the proposal could be constructed under permitted development, and noting what has been built in the wider area, it is considered to be acceptable.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed first floor side/rear extension would have a staggered side elevation with two points falling to meet the Policy Guidance 36, of The Residential Design SPD which states that the proposed development should be set in from the boundary by at least 1m to maintain the existing gaps between properties and the rhythm of gaps. However, various parts of the side extension would maintain a reasonable distance from the boundary. Additionally, the proposed development would be set down by more than 500mm from the main roof and would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 3.6m, aiding in obscuring it from the streetscene. \r\rAs such, on balance, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.  It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extension, using the BRE, 45 and 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD.\r\rGiven the proximity of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties and the position of habitable room windows at these properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Plan which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling which falls within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area and Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The applicant demonstrates a single-storey rear/side extension that would have a total parapet roof height of approximately 3.7m and a depth of approximately 6.4m, only extending past the existing single-storey rear extension by approximately 500mm. Generally, the depth of 6.4m and parapet roof height of 3.7m would not be considered as acceptable as it would fall outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. However, this in-fill development would only increase the overall length of the dwelling by just over 500mm and it would not be visible for streetscene. Additionally, similar developments can be found in the vicinity of Kings Road.\r\rTherefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 194 to 203 of the NPPF (2023) set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of the Liverpool Road Conservation area can be summarised as: An area of individually designed detached and semi-detached houses dating from the 1850s set in a mature landscape on the edge of Richmond Park.\r\rAs previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in general keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Additionally, the proposal would not involve the disruption of the mature landscaping on site. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Liverpool Road Conservation Area and the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rErection of single storey rear, first floor rear extension. Hip to gable roof extension with rear dormer and juliet balcony and installation of 1 no rooflight on top of flat roof and 2 nos front rooflights.\r\rConsultations\r4 properties were notified of the proposal. One representation has been received objecting to the proposal, with comments summarised as follows:\r- Overshadowing and loss of daylight\r- Inappropriate design \r- Excessive scale, mass and bulk\r- Loss of privacy, inadequate separation distance in relation to the proposed roof extension\r\rOfficer response: The above concerns will be addressed with this report.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed hip to gable and installation of the front rooflights is considered to be acceptable and in-keeping with the existing street scene which includes a wide range of roof level extensions.\r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended set down distances from the roof ridge and set in distance from the eaves of the roof of 500mm. However, considering that the property benefits from permitted development rights with regards to roof extensions, this element of the proposal is considered to be acceptable as a simimlar form of development could be achieved under permitted development.\r\rThe proposed first floor rear extension would be approximately 3.2m deep. The separation distance to the adjoining No 11 Darley Drive would be approximately 2.7m and to the common boundary with No 7 it would be approximately 2.6m. Given the proposed design, scale, mass and bulk of the proposed first floor rear extension, it is considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area, in general accordance with Policy Guidance 34. \r\rAs the host dwelling benefits from the existing single storey rear extension, the proposed infill extension would be of similar depth to the existing one, and it would project approximately 3.1m beyond the existing rear building line of No 11. The proposed eaves height would be approximately 2.7m. Given the siting, the proposed design and mass, the proposed single storey rear extension is considered to be acceptable. \r\rOfficers note concerns raised within the written representations regarding the proposed design and scale, mass and bulk of the proposal, however various large extensions to properties  on Darley Drive are noted, for example at No 1, therefore the scale of the proposed development and its design is considered to be in-keeping with the existing street scene.  \r\rIt is further noted, the properties on Darley drive are of different styles and design, therefore the proposed design of the proposal would not have any significant impact on the character and appearance of the existing street scene. \r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the siting of the proposed development, its height and the separation distances, it would pass the 45 degree rule in relation to the adjoining properties and therefore it would not result in an unacceptable loss of daylight in relation to these properties. \r\rThe proposed mass and bulk of the proposal, given its siting and the proposed design is considered not to appear as an overbearing when viewed from the adjoining properties or Darley Drive. \r\rWith regards to the concerns raised about potential loss of privacy, it is noted that the proposed side windows above the ground floor would be obscure glazed and non-openable below 1.7m when measured from the floor level, which would be secured via condition. \r\rThe separation distance between the proposed rear dormer roof extension and its openings to the boundary with No 52 Overland Avenue would be approximately 24m, which is in accordance with Policy Guidance 31 Separation Distances.  It is noted that due to the siting of the proposal it would not be directly overlooking any properties. \r\rAs such,it is considered that the proposed development due to its siting, proposed design and  scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "Introduction\r\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r4 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received in support or in objection. \r\rPlanning History\rNo planning history recorded.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks planning permission for the demolition of the existing rear conservatory and the erection of s single storey rear extension and internal. alterations.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located in Oakcroft Villas in Chessington and comprises a two storey semi detached residential dwellinghouse.\r\rThe immediate surrounding area is predominantly residential in character, consisting  of semi detached dwellinghouses.\r\rThe application site is not located in a Conservation Area and does not comprise a statutory or locally listed building. \r\rPlanning Assessment \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  for the demolition of the existing rear conservatory  and the erection of a single storey rear extension together with internal alterations.\r\rThe existing conservatory projects a depth of approximately 4.9m and the proposed extension would project a depth of 4.9m in the same position and a width of 4.08m   The proposed  low  mono pitch new roof would have an eaves height of 2.3m and an upper built height abutting the existing house of 3.2m.  The proposed roof will present plain tiles to match existing and due to the low pitch include a BBA certified underlay to be installed.  The proposed roof of the extension would present a single new velux window . \r\rNew folding doors are proposed for the new rear elevation and  a single window is proposed to be installed on the western elevation.    The walls of the extension  will be white rendered  to match existing. Proposed guttering and fascia are to match the existing.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the extension to the rear, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Based on its siting at the rear of the dwellinghouse and replacement of existing conservatory  with a single storey rear extension on the same built footprint, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire safety \r\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy , however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation  assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12 (A). the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons. Officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks the following amendment to planning permission reference: 22/01998/HOU:\r\r- Installation of 2no. heat pumps to the side wall behind the front gate.\r- Installation of external insulated render to improve the thermal performance of the house.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the applicant has submitted details demonstrating the location of the proposed heat pumps, a noise assessment, an air conditioning leaflet and air source heat pump details. However, the heat pumps would require an assessment by the council's Environmental Health Team, indicating that it would not be a non-material change to planning permission 22/01998/HOU. Paragraph K of Policy DM10 of the Core Strategy states, ' Development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance'. \r\rThe applicant has not provided sufficient details regarding the 50mm of Kingspn K5 external wall insulation coated with silicone render to the front, side and rear of the dwelling. Therefore, officers are unable to assess the impact on the character and appearance of the dwelling and the wider area and would therefore be considered not to be non-material.\r\rAccordingly, the proposed amendments are considered to be greater than non-material and it is recommended that the application be refused.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling situated on a prominent corner plot location.\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 representation has been received in regard to construction noise. The concern raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The proposed single-storey side extension involves the demolition of two structures (garage and carport) and the erection of a side extension that would have a width of approximately 6.5m, a total pitched roof height of 4m and a maximum separation distance from the side boundary of approximately 1.3m. Parts of the front extension would be sited closer to the curved boundary. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed extension would maintain more than 500mm (approximately 900mm) from the boundary. However, the proposed extension would have a width of more than 50% of the host dwelling, falling outside Policy Guidance 35, of the Residential Design and would be highly prominent in the streetscene. Officers acknowledge that side extensions are not incongruous in the immediate vicinity, however, examples such as neighbouring property No.110 Thornhill Road have a side extension that does not extend so close to the side boundary or have a footprint as large as the proposed development. In this context, the proposed extension would appear overly dominant and prominent.\r\rConsidering all of the above, the proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\rGiven the proximity of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOfficers note the objection regarding potential noise increase as a result of construction of the proposed development, however, as the proposals comprise residential development in a residential area it is not considered that there would be any significant increase in noise and disturbance. Officers would not expect construction noise levels from a development of this scale to be unacceptable to neighbouring properties. Any issues relating to noise should be reported to the Council's Environmental Health Team\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The existing garage would not safely accommodate on-site car parking by failing to comply with the space parameters required by the Sustainable Transport SPD, 2013. However, as demonstrated on the site photographs the occupants use the side gate to access car parking at the rear of the property (in front of the existing garage). Policy Guidance 35, of the Residential Design SPD states that side extensions should not affect the existing parking provision of the development and any parking lost as a result of the extension should be replaced on plot.\r\rThe applicant has submitted an application form that states that the parking provision would remain the same on site, therefore, the proposed development would not result in the loss of off-street car parking provision on site. However, were the application otherwise acceptable, a planning condition would have been required to demonstrate the retained parking arrangements to ensure that the retained car parking would be fit for purpose and could be accessed safely.\r\rIn terms of cycle parking, despite the loss of the existing garage and the potential cycle storage contained therein, it is considered that given the size of the rear garden and the retention of the side access, secure and covered cycle storage could be accommodated in the rear garden and easily accessed.\r\rOverall, the proposal would not have an adverse impact on car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant submitted a Fire Safety Strategy dated 29 August 2023 which would be accordance with Policy D12 (Fire safety) of the London Plan 2021. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rOne objection received and summarised as follows\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Loss of light/Sunlight\r - Privacy\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would not follow the guiding principles of the LPA's adopted LDF Residential Design SPD. The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History- 23/01488/HOU - Demolition of garage, conservatory and rear extension and erection of single storey rear/side wraparound extension and first floor and roof extensions. Internal and facade alterations, and all associated works. Refused on 31/07/2023.\r\r- 23/00745/HOU - Demolition of existing garage and erection of single-storey wraparound rear/side extension with associated changes to fenestration. Alteration to side dormer roof including change of flat roof to sloped. Floor plan redesign and all associated works. Granted on 15/05/2023.\r\r- 22/03830/HOU - Demolition of existing garage and erection of single-storey wraparound rear/side extension with associated changes to fenestration. Alteration to side dormer roof including change of flat roof to sloped. Installation of existing insulation, floor plan redesign and all associated works. Granted on 14/02/3023.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted a planning application (ref: 23/01488/HOU) which was refused for the following reason:\r\rBy reason of the proposed removal of the original cat-slide feature, the proposal would not relate well to the dwellinghouse or the group of properties on the same side of Brockenhurst Road that the application site forms a part of and would therefore be out of keeping with the character and appearance of the original property and surrounding area, thereby conflicting with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rThe current submission includes some amendments to the previously refused scheme (23/01488/HOU). The amendments include a change to the layout and design of the front elevation (cat-slide feature), adding a rooflight to the roof of the main dwelling and changing the size of the rooflight on the proposed rear extension. \r\rRoof Extension (Alteration to Side Dormer) -  Whilst officers acknowledge that the applicant previously submitted an application with a similar proposal under planning permission 23/00745/HOU. It is noted that the current proposed extensions and alterations to the first floor and roof would involve the complete removal of the original cat-slide feature to the front of the dwelling, which is a distinct character of several of the dwellings on Brockenhurst Avenue. Officers acknowledge that the applicant proposes a new cat-slide feature, however, this would not be acceptable as it would appear dissimilar to the original cat-slide feature in the vicinity Brockenhurst Avenue. The proposed cat-slide feature would be sited forward of the original, would not appear to be connected to the main roof and would be clearly read within the street scene as an unavailing and discordant feature.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extensions and alterations to the side dormer/roof would harm the character and appearance of the host dwelling and the wider area.\r\rSingle Storey Rear Extension - The applicant previously submitted an application which was granted through planning permission 23/00745/HOU & refused planning application 23/01488/HOU. The general scope of the proposal does not differ. The proposed rear extension would extend past the existing conservatory and outrigger by approximately 1.7m and would have a flat roof height of 3.2m which would not generally follow the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33. However, it would not be visible from the street scene and would appear subordinate and proportionate.\r\rOverall, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted plans/elevations showing the BRE 45 Degree Rule to demonstrate that the proposed development would not significantly harm the amenity of the neighbouring properties, in regard to sunlight. However, the proposed single storey rear extension would be constructed at the same depth as the approved rear extension (21/02775/HOU) at No.76 Brockenhurst Avenue and would have a 3.3m high parapet roof falling in line with the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 33.\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not have a significant adverse effect on the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe applicant seeks approval for the proposed erection of a single-storey rear extension\r\rConsultations\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRelevant Planning History \r23/01250/CPU - Erection of single-storey rear extension. Refused on 27.06.2023 for the following reasons:\r\r1. The proposal would extend beyond a wall forming a side elevation of the original dwellinghouse, and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse. The proposed development would therefore not fall within the parameters of Class A.1 (j) (iii) of Class A of Part 1 of Schedule 2 to the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\r2. It has not been demonstrated that the materials for the proposed development would be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse. Therefore the proposed development would fail to comply with condition A3.(a), Class A, Part 1, Schedule 2 of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total depth of approximately 2.7m from the rear wall and a total pitched roof height of 3.7mfalling in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD for semi-detached dwellings. Additionally, the proposed development would not be visible from the streetscene and subordinate and proportionate to the existing dwelling.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD.\r\rIn regard to No.4 Chumleigh Walk, the 45-degree line would be breached on plan but would be considered acceptable on elevation. Whilst officers acknowledge some loss of light to the nearest ground floor habitable room (kitchen/dinner) of No.4, it would not be significant as No.4 benefits from a window (on the rear elevation) that serves the same room. \r \rThe Lilacs, Chumleigh Walk sits at a reasonable distance from the boundary shared with No.2 Chumleigh Walk, therefore, no significant harm would be caused to The Lilac as a result of the proposed development.\r\rOverall, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
