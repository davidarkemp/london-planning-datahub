    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking and/or re-enacting that Order) no windows, other than those shown on the approved plans shall at any time be placed in the north-west elevation of the building/extension hereby permitted without the grant of a separate planning permission from the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached building in a commercial use.\r\rThe key area of assessment is:\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r\rMaldens and Coombe CAAC - No objection.\r\rSection 66 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) states that in considering whether to grant planning permission for development which affects a listed building or its setting, the local planning authority shall have special regard to the desirability of preserving the building or its setting or any features of special architectural or historic interest which it possesses.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy 7.8 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rThe site is located within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and the application building is Grade II Listed. The significance of the conservation area can be summarised as large Victorian, Edwardian, and 20th century properties set in a semi-rural street scene around the open space occupied by Coombe Wood Golf Course. The significance of the listed building is as a fine example of the 1920s' vernacular revival style.\r\rAll of the window frames within the application building are late 20th Century aluminium casement style windows set in the original brick or oak sub-frames. This application proposes the replacement of windows and frames to all elevations on a like-for-like basis in terms of colour and materials (black powder coated aluminium), with repair of the oak sub-frames where necessary. \r\rGiven that the windows to be replaced are not original and the work would be carried out on a like-for-like basis, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in a material change to the character and appearance of the area or to the historic fabric of the building. Accordingly, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the significance of either the conservation area or the listed building. It is not therefore necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, and the Policies of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house that shows a rear outrigger. The total enlargement would extend beyond the side elevation adjoining the outrigger and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) & (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended). The proposed development has been conceived as an entity, would be constructed as an entity, and should be viewed as such, as found by the Inspector in appeal ref: APP/B1930/X/14/2225047 dated 07.07.2015, the proposal as a whole would constitute an enlargement.",
    "Please provide a copy of a site plan.",
    "1 Under the Town and Country Planning (Fees for Applications, Deemed Applications, Requests and\rSite Visits) (England) Regulations 2012 a 'free go' is only applicable If the proposal is the first\rrevision of an application for development of the same character or description on the same site by\rthe same applicant within 12 months of making the earlier application if withdrawn or the date of\rdecision if granted or refused (including signs only if withdrawn or refused) and NOT a duplicate\rapplication made by the same applicant within 28 days.\r\rPlease note the previous application type was different to the current application and therefore not\rentitled to a free go. The fee required is Â£231.00\r\rPayment can be made via either our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002, by cheque made payable to\rRoyal Borough of Kingston upon Thames or online via the Kingston council website.",
    "Please complete application form to show the name of applicant as this is a requirement."
