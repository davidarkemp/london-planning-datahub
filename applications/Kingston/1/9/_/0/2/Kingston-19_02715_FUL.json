    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling located within the Richmond Road Conservation Area. \r\rProposal \rDemolition of existing conservatory and erection of single storey rear extension. Changes to fenestrations and replacement of single glazed windows with double glazed traditional box sash timber windows. Installation of 9nos. Rooflights.\r\rConsultations\r6 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rConservation Areas Advisory Committee - objects to number of the proposed rooflights\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Richmond Road Conservation Area; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth and height. However, considering its siting and the proposed separation distances, as well as the proposed design, it is considered that it would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. It is noted that the adjoining property No 34 benefits from similar scale extension. \r\rWith regards to the proposed replacement of the windows to double glazed traditional box sash painted timber windows, as shown on the drawings, and installation of conservation area rooflights, these elements of the proposal are considered to be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rOfficers note concerns received from the Kingston and North Kingston Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee regarding the excessive number of the proposed rooflights. However, due to the small separation distances between the properties and siting of the rooflights, it is considered that they would not be readily visible within the street scene.\r\rFurthermore, the adjoining properties benefit from a similar number of rooflights, therefore this element of the proposal would not result in significant impact to St Albans Road. \r\rThe applicant has declared on the application form that no trees would be removed or pruned in order to carry the proposal, therefore it is considered that the proposal would not adversely affect the existing protected trees and therefore would not have an adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as  a range of fine late Victorian and Edwardian houses of distinctive groups of red brick construction. \r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless contributes positively to the conservation area. \r\rOfficers note the following objections received from Kingston and North Kingston Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee:\r\r'Reason for objection: These plans show no piggy back roof extension so how do they relate to PA 24/00163 from the same applicant. This needs to be resolved prior to any decision. No comment on new fenestration as it is largely like for like traditional sash windows nor on the new rear extension which is not visible from the public realm. However, the addition of nine roof lights, even though conservation grade, seems excessive & will be clearly visible from the highway.'\r\rIt should be noted that the current scheme is a separate application to the recently approved ref  24/00163/HOU. \r\rThe applicant is reminded that implementing this development in combination with another development, whether pursuant to permitted development rights, a prior approval or a planning permission could render the totality of the works unlawful. This is particularly the case where the proposals would physically adjoin. The applicant is strongly advised to seek further advice before proceeding with any approval.\r\rWith regards to the number of proposed rooflights, Officers note that similar schemes are present within the existing street scene. Given their siting and the proposed design/materials  it is considered that this part of the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and would be suitable for the conservation area. \r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area and therefore it would be appropriate for the property located within a conservation area. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the conservation area and would preserve its significance. It is therefore not necessary to weigh the proposed development against any public benefits.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIt is noted that the proposal includes provision of a raised patio area, in such cases privacy screens of approximately 1.7m installed along the sides of the proposed area would be required,details of which would be secured via a relevant condition. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Planning Fire Strategy Statement, which is considered to be acceptable.  \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "The RBK Tree and Landscape officer raised an objection to the submission for Condition 8 for the following reasons:\r\rThe landscape and planting plan submitted is not sufficient for the discharge of the associated condition due to a poor choice of replacement tree and hedge species.\r\rThe plan should be resubmitted showing the following edits:\r- The planting of a mixed native species hedgerow instead of Cypress to be planted at a pregrown height of 1.5m in a staggered double row.\r- The planting of Fastigiate Hornbeam (Carpinus betulus 'Fastigiata') as 4m standards in replacement of the Rowan across the frontage, reducing their number to 7 trees evenly spaced within the hedgerow, with 4 on the West side of the entrance gate and 3 on the East (2 on the entrance side of the existing tree and a further 1 on the far side of the tree to create an even spacing of 4 trees mirroring the opposite side of the entrance).\r- The 2 Western Red Cedar shown on the frontage immediate to the entrance should be replaced with Variegated Privet (Ligustrum lucidum 'Variegata') in tree form.\r- The 2 Western Red Cedar shown centrally to the rear should be replaced with a pair of flowering Cherry, suggestions I would make would be:\r'Prunus maackii Amber Beauty' and 'Prunus Shirofugen' which would provide different seasonal colour, interest and flowering times with the first in the Spring and the second in the Autumn.",
    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2022 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rConsultations\r6 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  1  letter of objection received and states : \rLoss of light/ sunlight\r\rThese material considerations will be included within the assessment.\r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single rear storey / side wrap around extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises  a terraced dwelling. \r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal seeks to  erect a single storey rear / side wrap around extension to the existing dwelling.  \r\rOfficers note the existing dwelling projects a 4.86m in depth outrigger. The proposal  would present a  single storey wrap around 'L' shaped  extension which  would project a depth of 7.8m  beyond the existing rear elevation  of the main dwelling  and 3m  in depth beyond the existing outrigger. Overall, the proposed extension would have a width of 5.140m.\r\rThe proposed development would be positioned hard on the boundary with  both adjoining   neighbouring dwellings  at  nos 48  7.8m in depth)  and 44 Albemarle Gardens (3m in depth). \r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension  would have a part flat, part single aspect pitch roof . The proposed flat roof element would extend the width of the existing rear outrigger and would have an eaves height of 3.267m which would be in conflict with the recommendations  as set out in Policy Guidance 33 in the Residential Design SPD. The proposed part single aspect pitch roof  would have an eaves height of 2.5m and accommodate 5no rooflights .   \r\rThe proposed rear elevation would present  bi fold high security doors and be finished in smooth render to  match the existing house.  The proposed flank elevation facing towards No 44 Albemarle Gardens would have no fenestration and be finished in smooth render to match the proposed rear elevation . \r\rOverall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers have assessed the impact on daylight of the proposed rear extension using the BRE 45 degree rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. \r\rIn terms of siting and depth,  the proposed development would sit hard against the shared boundaries with  neighbouring properties  nos 44 and 48 Albemarle Gardens.  Officers have reviewed the submitted rear elevation drawings together with the accompanying photographs with particular attention given to no 48 Albemarle Gardens and the existing fenestration arrangement. RBK Planning Records show No 48 Albemarle Gardens obtained planning permission  in 07.10.21 (Ref 21/0165/HOU)  for the erection of a single storey rear extension with associated changes to the fenestration.  \r\r A site visit  to no 48 Albemarle Gardens has confirmed implementation of the planning permission (Ref 21/0165/HOU)  and the new fenestration arrangement on the rear elevation of the dwelling . The submitted proposed rear elevation drawing inaccurately depicts the  fenestration arrangement at no 48 Albemarle Gardens  - the small window as shown on the drawing is no longer in situ and Officers are of the opinion the position of the  patio doors is inaccurately shown on the submitted drawings.  \r\rIn considering the impact on daylight at no 48 Albemarle Gardens, the proposals fails the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the proposals at 46 Albemarle Gardens, indicating that it  is likely  that there would   be a significant loss of daylight to the existing rear window. Given the height and depth of the extension along the boundary and in the absence of a daylight assessment to demonstrate otherwise, it is considered that the proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight at No 48  Albemarle Gardens. \r\rIn considering the impact on daylight at no 44 Albemarle Gardens, the proposals fails the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the proposals at 46 Albemarle Gardens, indicating that it  is likely  that there would   be a significant loss of daylight to the existing rear window. Given the height and depth of the extension along the boundary and in the absence of a daylight assessment to demonstrate otherwise, it is considered that the proposed extension would result in an unacceptable loss of daylight at No 44  Albemarle Gardens. \r\rIn addition to the above, due to its siting and depth  hard along the shared boundary with no. 44 Albemarle Gardens, it is considered the proposed development  would create a dominant and overbearing feature that would create an unnecessary sense of enclosure as well as  constitute an unneighbourly form of development and present an overbearing appearance in this location. \r\rIn respect of no 48 Albemarle Gardens, due to the siting, depth and height of the proposed development along the shared boundary  it is considered that the proposed development would constitute an unneighbourly form of development and would present an overbearing appearance in this location.  \r\rOverall, given the size of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties of nos 44 and 48 Albemarle Gardens, it is considered that the proposed development would adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance  and creating a sense of enclosure .\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to:\r\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings\r- Loss of light/Sunlight\r- Privacy\r\rAll concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear extension would have a depth of approximately 3m and a parapet roof height of approximately 3.3m, this would fall in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD and would appear subordinate and proportionate to the host dwelling. Therefore, solely the proposed single-storey rear extension would not cause harm to the charter and appearance of the wider area.\r\rThe applicant proposes a first-floor side extension that would have a set down from the original ridge of the roof by approximately 270mm and would be set in from the boundary shared with No. 20 by approximately 1m, in line with Policy Guidance 36, of the Residential Design SPD. However, the proposed first-floor extension along with the proposed gable end extensions would appear bulky in the street scene and significantly differ from the majority of development on Romney Road. \r\rWhilst the double gable extension would not necessarily unbalance the neighbouring properties  No.20 and No.16, as they are detached from No.18, it would not be appropriate when viewed in the context of the wider area of Romney Road. The proposed gable ends would appear incongruous and bulky in the immediate vicinity and to the host dwelling. \r\rWhen solely focusing on the proposed dormer officers note that the proposal would not generally meet the requirements of Policy Guidance 39, in regards to being set down from the ridge of the roof and in from the eaves by 500mm. Additionally, it is noted that dormers are not prominent in the vicinity of Romney Road. However, officers acknowledge that this proposal element would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rOverall, the proposed development as a whole would not appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, would be excessive in scale, and would sit uncomfortably with the host and surrounding properties and within the street scene. Additionally, the double gable-ended design would not relate well to the dwellinghouse or other properties on Romney Road which is characterised by pitched roofs. \r\rTherefore, officers consider that there would be adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would not be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe proposed loft balcony is not a common feature of this relatively low density suburban area. While the proposed privacy screens would help mitigate loss of privacy to neighbours it would not wholly mitigate this impact. The proposed balcony would be visually intrusive, result in a loss of privacy and would give rise to additional noise and disturbance. It is considered that the proposed balcony would have a wholly unacceptable adverse impact on neighbouring amenity.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Statement which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

However, the proposed rear extension would have a modest eave height of approximately 2.7m, would not be visible from the street scene and would appear to be proportionate to the host dwelling and, therefore, would not cause harm in regard to the character and appearance of the host dwelling or the wider area.\r\rThe applicant also proposes a side extension connecting to the rear extension. It would have a total height of approximately 3.2m and be set back from the front elevation by approximately 5.5m in line with Policy Guidance 35, of the Residential Design SPD. officers acknowledge that the side extension would be visible from the street scene, however, it is considered the proposal would not cause a significant negative impact on the street scene of Surbiton Hall Close. \r\rOverall, it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and it is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylight of the proposed rear extension which would be a maximum of approximately 4.2m in height and 4m in depth.

    "Application Site\rThe proposal site is located on the south west side of Ewell Road and comprises a 3 storey building with vacant restaurant on the ground floor and residential use on the upper floors. The building is vacant. The rear of the site fronts Tolworth Close. There is an existing parking space to the rear. \r\rThe surrounding area is located within the Tolworth District Centre and comprises a mixture of residential and commercial uses.The area is of mixed use character with a range of buildings differing in scale and appearance. \r\rThe existing property is not listed nor is it located within a conservation area. \r\rThe site has a Public Transport Accessibility Level (PTAL) of 3 (moderate). The site is not within a CPZ.\r\rRelevant History\r32604 Erection of single storey rear extension - Application Granted on 29 Oct 1980\r\rThe adjacent property - 462  Ewell Road, 15/16149/PNO prior approval was not require for the conversion of the ground floor  front and rear building to provide a one-bedroom flat and a two-bedroom flat.\r\rProposal\rPermission is sough for alterations to the existing single storey rear extension and verandah and internal alterations, including the incorporation of the verandah structure as part of the extension, with flat roof Change of use of ground floor from commercial (Use Class E) to residential (Use Class C3) comprising 1no. two bed (3-person) flat.

Changes to front fenestrations.\r\rConsultation\rNeighbouring Occupiers: 20  notification letters were sent and no response received\r\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer: No objection raised, subject to the submission of a Construction Logistics plan\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\rPrinciple\rHousing Delivery\rEmployment\rThe design of the proposed development; \rQuality of Accommodation\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings\rTransport\r\rPrinciple\rTthe NPPF (2023) states that Planning policies and decisions should promote an effective use of land in meeting the need for homes and other uses, while safeguarding and improving the environment and ensuring safe and healthy living conditions. Strategic policies should set out a clear strategy for accommodating objectively assessed needs, in a way that makes as much use as possible of previously-developed or 'brownfield' land . \r\rThe NPPF advises  that planning decisions should promote and support the development of under-utilised land and buildings, especially if this would help to meet identified needs for housing where land supply is constrained and available sites could be used more effectively.\r\rHousing Delivery\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2021.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of The London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 years period which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. \r\rThe proposed development would provide a net increase of two dwellings on site which is considered to be a benefit of the scheme. The principle of an additional dwellings within the district centre is considered to be acceptable subject to the considerations set out below.\r\rLoss of Employment\rPolicy DM17 seeks to protect employment use, particularly within the designated District Centre unless it has been demonstrated  that there is no qualitative  or quantitative need.  The last use of  the ground floor was as a restaurant. The property is within the Tolworth District Centre, but not located within a designated shopping frontage. The Planning Statement advises that  the \"ground floor of the premises was used as a restaurant, although this is believed to have ceased around 10 years ago\". \r\rWhilst the site was originally within part of the Article 4 Direction area, this part of the District centre was excluded in the modified Article 4 Direction, which  came into force on 14 June 2023. \r\rTherefore, the site benefits from the provision of Class MA permitted development rights that provides new opportunities for the conversion of vacant commercial buildings to support housing delivery, economic recovery and high street regeneration.\r\rIt is noted that a number of other former commercial premises along this stretch of Ewell Road have been converted into residential use. The building has been vacant  for a considerable number of years. \r\rOfficers consider that the  use for residential purposes is considered appropriate in these circumstances, particularly noting  the long history of vacancy and the the fallback position.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment:  To the rear, the proposal involves extending the existing ground floor extension to incorporate the area of the existing verandah Approximately 2.1m in depth). The extension has a flat roof , and would not be readily visible from public view.\r\rThe application when it was initially submitted included a very basic and utilitarian arrangement to the shopfront arrangement, to allow residential use.The  application has been amended to revise the design of the ground floor elevation treatment, positioning the front door central to the frontage, with proportionate windows either side, featuring headers and cills.  As revised, the design is considered appropriate, and of similar  design treatment to other  properties within this parade. \r\rQuality of Accommodation\rPolicy D6 (Housing Quality and Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately sized rooms (as set out in Table 3.1 of the London Plan 2021) with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Table 3.1 of the London Plan (2021) sets out minimum space requirements for residential accommodation.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan (2021) encourages housing developments to maximise the provision of dual aspect dwellings and normally avoid the provision of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings should only be provided where it is considered a more appropriate design solution to meet the requirements of Part B of Policy D3 of the London Plan (2021).\rThe proposed conversion would provide a  2 bedroom flat  3 person flat  at ground floor with a floor area of  76sqm and 2 x 1 bedroom 1 person flats on each of the fist and second floors. 1st floor  37.4  (with shower), 2nd floor  41.2sqm. , which is in compliance with the above space standards for flats of these size and occupancy.  The bedrooms are of appropriate size. \rThe London Plan (2021) requires at atleast 75% of the GIA of each flat to have a  2.5m ceiling height to ensure that new housing is of adequate quality in terms of daylight penetration, ventilation and cooling. Officers note that both first and second floor flats are slightly below this standard, with ceiling heights of  approximately 2.4 metres. It is noted that each flat is dual aspect, and therefore would have access to good levels of light and ventilation. The ceiling heights  would also  satisfy national minimum standards in respect of ceiling height.  \r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Residential Design SPD states that a minimum of 10 sqm outside amenity area should be provided, with an additional 1sqm per occupant.  Flatted developments should also provide 50sqm of communal amenity area. \r\rThe ground floor flat is provided with a private garden of 20 sqm,  to the rear of which is  shared amenity space  (20sqm) for the two upper flats. The level of provision is considered reasonably compliant with policy requirements.\r\rThe ground floor flat would be accessed from the front, and the upper flats via Tolworth Close. It is noted that the access path would be narrow and approximately 20 metre in length. This is a similar arrangement to existing. The application has been amended to detail the provision of bulkhead lights along the length of the access to  and details are secured by condition.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rThe small extension replaces an existing verandah structure, and would not result in any material loss of daylight, sunlight or outlook to neighbouring occupiers.  \r\rOn this basis it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways and Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan (2021) sets out that car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy (2012) seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions, and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety\r\rThe site has a PTAL of 3 and is located within Tolworth District Centre.\rLondon Plan Policy T6 states that Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite'). Car-free development has no general parking but should still provide disabled persons parking in line with Part E of this policy.\r\rLondon Plan policy would allow a maximum of 2 parking spaces. There is  1  on-site  car  parking  space  which  would  be  retained, in compliance with the above policy \r\rTable 10.2 of the London Plan (2021) requires a 2 or more bedroom unit to provide two secure and covered cycle parking spaces, with 1 space for a 1 bedroom unit. \r\rCycle parking is provided  for each flat, and secured by condition.\r\rpositioning the front door central to the frontage, with proportionate windows either side, featuring headers and cills.\rThe Neighbourhood Traffic Engineer raises no objection, subject to the submission of a Construction Logistics plan.\r\rWaste & Recycling\rPolicy DM10(s) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) requires that development proposals: 'make adequate provision for waste facilities, including recycling facilities, and to ensure that these are located (a) where they cause minimal adverse impact on the amenities of the local area, particularly sensitive areas like conservation areas and (b) where they can be adequately accessed and serviced'.\r\rThe proposal provides an area for refuse and recycling storage, accessed  from Tolworth Close \r\rFire Safety\rPolicy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021) states that all development proposals must achieve the highest standards of fire safety and ensure that they:\r\r1) identify suitably positioned unobstructed outside space: \r\t\ta) for fire appliances to be positioned on \r\t\tb) appropriate for use as an evacuation assembly point \r2) are designed to incorporate appropriate features which reduce the risk to life and the risk of serious injury in the event of a fire; including appropriate fire alarm systems and passive and active fire safety measures \r3) are constructed in an appropriate way to minimise the risk of fire spread \r4) provide suitable and convenient means of escape, and associated evacuation strategy for all building users \r5) develop a robust strategy for evacuation which can be periodically updated and published, and which all building users can have confidence in\r6) provide suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development.\rA Fire Statement has been submitted which  addresses the requirements of Policy D12(A) of the London Plan (2021). \r\rSustainability\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes level  6. Policy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption. Details of water consumption secured by condition.\r\rConclusion and Planning Balance\rPart (d) of Paragraph 11 of the 2018 NPPF states where there are no relevant development plan policies, or the policies which are most important for determining the application are out-of-date, the Council should grant planning permission unless: the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed or any adverse impacts of doing so would significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against the policies in this Framework taken as a whole.   In this case the Council does not have a 5 year housing land supply and so this application for residential development will be subject to paragraph (d). As such, the development should be permitted unless the adverse impacts significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits.\r\rThe  proposed  development  would  provide  a  net  increase  of   Class  C3  market  dwelling  which  would  be  a  benefit  of  the  scheme.  This  would  carry  significant weight in favour of the development. \r\rThe loss of  potential employment floorspace is a disbenefit of the scheme,  but is nevertheless considered acceptable given the long periods of vacancy and the fallback position of permitted development. The degree of harm is assessed as low.  \r\rThe size  of the units largely in compliance with minimum space standards.  Adequate amenity space is provided. Floor to ceiling heights for the two upper floor flats are marginally below London Plan standard, but do comply with national space standards.  This would carry minor weight against the scheme.\r\rThe  proposal  would   provide  sufficient  waste/recycling  storage,   secure  on-site cycle  parking   so  as  to  encourage  sustainable  modes  of  travel  by  residents, and provides  an on site parking space.  This  would  carry  neutral   weight  as it is a policy requirement In  this  case\r\rOfficers  conclude  that  the  proposed  development  would  be  in  general compliance  with  the  Development Plan. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r",

The building is locally listed.\r\rConsultation \rOne objection received and summarised as follows \r- Light pollution \r- anti social behaviour \r\rKTCAAC _ Objection to quality of submission and harm to conservation area\r\rProposal \rAlterations to beer garden including erection of 2no. pergolas, retractable awning, 2no. garden entrance arches, lighting including 2no. lamp posts, new waitress station and seating. Installation of new plant boxes to front elevation of public house.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rParagraphs 195 to 214 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is considered that the proposal would reduce the openness of the site at the rear which is currently of a relatively open nature. The addition of the garden arches, awning and pergolas in particular due to their siting, scale and massing added to the other new features in the beer garden would create an incongruous feature that would cause visual clutter and detract from the character and appearance of the host property a local listed building and fail to preserve or enhance the designated kingston Old Town Conservation Area.  It is considered that the proposed development is not acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that the proposal would have an adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rIt is considered that the widow boxes to the front would be acceptable. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the installation of new lighting. The application is not supported by an outdoor lighting assessment. Officers are concerned that the level of illumination and light spill from the new lighting could result in harmful levels of light pollution that could have a detrimental impact on the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers. The applicant has failed to demonstrate this would not be the case.\r\rIt is considered that the proposal would not result in increased activity in and around the site or lead to antisocial behaviour. The beer garden would be subject to strict licensing hours and any lighting would be required to be switched off and controlled by condition in line with the opening hours of the beer garden and in accordance with its licence. The beer garden provides natural surveillance to the adjacent public amenity space and it is not considered likely that the amenity space would be used more as a result of the proposal at the application site or the proposal would increase anti-social behaviour in the area.  \r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to not be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed development would not fully follow the guiding principles of the Council's adopted Residential Design SPD. However given the context of the site and its surroundings in this instance it is considered that the proposed development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area including the setting of the of the non designated Tudor Estate Local Area of Special Charater as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rOther matters\rA condition is recommended to secure the submission of fire safety strategy to ensure compliance with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIt is noted that the proposal would result in the loss of an integral garage. The property would still have sufficient space for off street parking on the hard standing to the front of the property. In addition the proposal involves the provision of a secure storage space which would be capable of providing bike storage. It is considered that the propsoal would not prejudice highway safety or lead to an increase off on street parking pressure and would still allow for secure and covered cycle parking on site. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",

The building is also a statutorily listed Grade II building. \r\rListing detail \r1901. 3 storeys plus attic. 3 main bays wide. Modern shop on the ground floor. The upper floors are faced with buff terracotta (some of which has been painted).

The key considerations are \r\rAmenity\rPublic safety\r\rAmenity \r\rThe signage would be located on the front and rear of the building. The site fronts Thames Street on the edge of the Market Place and at the rear faces onto the Kingston riverside and towpath. \r\rThe building occupies a prominent position in both the street and riverscape. The signage consisting of mounted individual non illuminated lettering is considered to be of a style and material finish that is not of an architectural style sympathetic to the host property.  It is considered that the signage proposed would be out of keeping with the type of signage elsewhere in the conservation area. The acrylic finish is considered to be unsympathetic to the existing external finishes of the building and the signage would be visually intrusive and would detract from the character and appearance of the host property. Overall it is considered that the proposal would fail to preserve or enhance the character and appearance of the area which forms part of the designated heritage asset, the Kingston Old Town Conservation Area and would detract from the special architectural integrity of the statutorily listed building causing less than substantial harm to the designated heritage assets.  \r\rPublic safety\r\rThe proposed signage would be static and would not obscure any highway signs or impede pedestrian movement.

    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a residential dwelling.\r\rConsultation \rOne objection received and summarised as follows:\r- Car park issues\r - Inappropriate design/layout\r - Noise\r - Unacceptable or incompatible use\r\rThe matters raised are addressed in the officers assessment. \r\rProposal \rPlanning permission is sought for the change of use from a 6 bedroom HMO (Use Class C4) to a 7 bedroom HMO (Use Class Sui Generis)\r\rRelevant History\r23/02718/HOU - Erection of single storey rear extension and hip to gable and rear dormer roof extension with 2 nos. front roof lights to facilitate loft conversion. Change to side fenestration. - Granted 24.11.2023\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Highways \r- Fire safety\r\rPrinciple \rThe application seeks a change of use from a C4 6 person House of multiple occupation (HMO) to a 7 person HMO sui generis use. \r\rIt has come to the attention of officers during the course of the application that the C4 use has not been implemented on site as shown on the existing drawings. The existing layout shown on the drawings is the proposed scheme permitted under planning permission 23/02718/HOU for a single storey rear and roof extension which was granted with a layout which showed a 6 person HMO. The works subject of that permission 23/02718/HOU have only been completed during the course of the existing application. \r\rPreviously the property was a 3 bed single dwellinghouse. As such the application description is wrong and the application should have been for a change of use from a C3 dwelling house to a 7 person HMO sui generis with associated alterations and extensions. \r\rNotwithstanding this the fall back position of planning permission 23/02718/HOU is relevant to the current proposal and a material consideration. \r\rPolicy DM14 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy states that the Council will resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types) and, in particular, dwellings which are suitable for family accommodation. To protect existing family units that meet an identified need, the Council will, where necessary, limit the conversion of family units into houses in multiple occupation. \r\rAs the HMO C4 use has not been implemented the existing use of the house is considered to be a C3 use a family sized unit. However the property benefits from a planning permission 23/02718/HOU which shows an approved HMO layout for 6 persons a C4 use. \r\rNotwithstanding this the Town and Country Planning Use Classes Order 1987 (as amended) allows for a permitted change without the need for planning permission from use class C3 to C4. \r\rTherefore on balance given the fall back position it is considered that proposal to change to a C4 use would be acceptable. The property would still remain in residential use albeit providing a different type of residential accommodation but the fall back position would negate the aspirations of the policy DM14 in this instance to resist the loss of family accommodation to a HMO use. \r\rThe current proposal seeks to intensify the HMO use by increasing the number of persons on site from 6 to 7 meaning the resultant use would be a sui generis use triggering the need for planning permission. As the unit could be used for a C4 HMO under the fall back position officers take the view that the policies of the current development plan do not preclude such types of development.\r\rFurthermore it is considered that the proposed development would be compatible with and would not change the primary use of the site as a residential property albeit in a different use class.\r\rAs such in principle the LPA would not object to the principle of the change of use subject to compliance with the relevant Development Plan policies.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: \r\rThe proposed development does not propose any external changes. \r\rHowever as noted the proposal is put forward on the basis that scheme permitted under planning permission 23/02718/HOU forms the existing set up on site. This is not the case and officers note that the planning permission works have only been completed it is stated during the course of this application. Therefore the works to the exterior of the property are considered to form part of this application as they would be necessary to implement the scheme proposed for a 7 bed HMO. \r\rHowever as the works have been granted permission and are extant under planning permission 23/02718/HOU on this occasion in the context of the site history and fall back position  it is considered the development would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. It is noted that the objection raises concerns regarding noise and disturbance due to the intensification of the use proposed and poor sound insulation between properties. It is considered that given the fall back position of planning permission 23/02718/HOU and the permitted change from C3 to C4 allowed under the Use Classes Order which allows a 6 person HMO the addition of 1 person to create a 7 bed HMO as opposed to a 6 bed HMO would not give rise to significantly higher noise levels than that of a 6 person HMO and on balance it is considered the proposal is acceptable in regards to residential amenity. \r\rHighways \rThe proposal is likely to give rise to increased demand for on street parking. The proposal is located in an area of controlled parking with a PTAL rating of 6a(best). The London Plan Policy T6.1 would require such developments in this PTAL location to be car free. However there is no restriction in place to prevent residents and their visitors from owning a motor vehicle and applying and obtaining a residents or visitors parking permit. In addition the application is not supported by a parking beat survey to show there is on street parking capacity. \r\rThe proposal does not provide off street parking so would be policy compliant. However as the applicant has not provided a parking beat survey to demonstrate there is sufficient local capacity on the highway network or signed and completed a legal agreement preventing future occupants and visitors of the units from applying and obtaining on street residents and visitors parking permits officers are concerned that in the absence of any mitigation of the demand for on street parking being in place the proposal has the potential to result in on street parking pressures that in turn could lead to local congestion on the highway network and prejudice highway safety. \r\rIt is noted that the proposal includes provision for 7 cycle spaces which would comply with the London Plan Policy T5. \r\rFire safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12 requires all developments to demonstrate fire safety compliance.\r\rThe deposited Fire Safety Strategy does not fully demonstrate how the development will achieve the highest standards of fire safety and shall include the following details:\r\r1) suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point; \r2) Appropriate fire alarm systems; \r3) Passive and active fire safety measures; \r4) appropriate construction details to minimise the risk of fire spread; \r5) provision of suitable and convenient means of escape/ an evacuation strategy; \r6) provision of suitable access and equipment for firefighting which is appropriate for the size and use of the development. \r\rAs such the proposal would not be in full accordance with Policy D12 (Fire Safety) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be not in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than not in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.

    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a semi detached dwelling. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rProposal \rDemolition of an existing garage and rear conservatory, erection of a single storey side and rear extension.\r\rConsultations\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey side extension would be set back from the front elevation by approximately 7.5m, it would be approximately 5m deep and of the total height of approximately 3.5m. Considering its set back from the front elevation, the proposed separation distance to the site boundary of approximately 0.9m and the proposed scale, it is considered that this element of the proposal would be in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area. \r\rIt is acknowledged that the proposed single storey rear extension (approximately 4m deep) would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the recommended depth and height. However, considering similar scale proposals within the immediate surrounding area and its siting, it is considered to be acceptable.  Officers note differences in ground levels.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that both adjoining properties benefit from rear extensions. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposal and its sale, it is considered that it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rLoss of Car Parking\r\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate 1 off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would not result in an unacceptable impact on the local highway network. Officers note no parking restrictions on Herne Road.  \r\rIn relation to cycle parking, Officers note that a secure cycle parking could be possibly provided within the existing amenity space to compensate for the loss of the garage. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Strategy, which is considered to be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be  in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r9 no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received.  \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension joining to the existing extension.\r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises a detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r23/03351/PAEXT -  Erection of single storey rear extension (8m  in depth, maximum height of 3.55m and eaves height 2.57m) Prior Approval refused 21.02.24\r05/14439/FUL - Alterations to roof detail during the course of construction to planning permission 04/14720/FUL.

Refused 06.07.90\r\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the erection of a single storey  extension adjoining an existing rear extension.\r\rThe dwelling currently hosts a 'L' shaped  convered and timber cladded sunroom at the rear  of the property which projects a maximum depth  of 5m    and  minimum depth of 1.8m. It presents a width of 10.235m which extends beyond the width of the main dwelling.  It is  a front open structure with the roof acting as a canopy. The side elevations are constructed of close boarded wooden screening /walls. It resides on a raised platform and steps lead down into the rear garden. The existing sunroom has a flat roof arrangement with an eaves height of 2.465m .\r\rThe proposed single storey extension  would project a depth of 3.930m  and width  of 8.635m  It includes a  shallow single aspect pitch  slate tiled canopy roof structure around the perimeter  with  a proposed height of 2.577m. Together with the main single storey rear extension the structure would project a depth of 4.530m.  \r\rThe proposed north east elevation facing towards no 28 Traps Lane would present a white rendered flank wall elevation  and the opposite proposed elevation of the extension would present large glazed walls. The proposed rear elevation would present  aluminium sliding doors.\r\rThe main proposed extension building would be set in  by at least 1m  from the boundary wall. Within the setting of the flat roof and  set in from the canopy, the  proposal would present a raised middle section  panelled in grey zinc  with an overall  height of 3.55m. It would provide 4 no rooflights and  a sedum  roof.   This roof element would be set in  over 2m  from the  boundary wall of the neighbouring properties. \r\rThe proposed extension would continue to reside on a raised platform above the garden  and decking would be introduced to wrap around the  extension which would extend forward a maximum of 3.624m. Two separate sets of steps which lead down into the rear garden. \r\rIn comparison with the existing arrangement, Officers note the absence of appropriate screening  on the boundary walls at the furthest points of the raised decking. Officers would recommend the installation of privacy screens along the neighbouring boundaries with nos24 and 28  Traps Lane extended to the depth of the proposed  raised terrace decking in order to  ensure satisfactory living conditions for neighbouring occupiers. This would be secured by way of a planning condition with details  for details to be submitted to the Local Planning Authority for approval.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey rear extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

    "The site comprises a terrace of maisonettes situated above a corner parade of shops at ground floor level. The main entrance door to each maisonette, is at first floor level to the rear of the parade of shops. There is a small car parking area and yard area to the rear of the parade of shops.\r\rConsultations\r- 31 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to Access or traffic problems, Car park issues, Excessive height or bulk of buildings and Noise.\r\rOfficers acknowledge the objections regarding noise, however, officers would not expect noise levels from a development of this scale to be unacceptable to neighbouring properties. All other concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\r- Borough Environmental Health Officer - No objection subject to conditions\r\r- RBK Highways - No objection subject to conditions. \r\r- Transport for London - comment: Having assessed the proposals, I can confirm that TfL Spatial Planning has no specific comments to make on this planning application other than to emphasise the development should comply with the transport policies set out in The London Plan 2021. In particular the car and cycle parking standards in tables 10.2 - 10.6 (inclusive). Cycle parking should comply with the London Cycling Design Standards (https://tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/streets toolkit).\r\rIf the development is permitted I recommend the developer is reminded of the following:\r\rRobin Hood Way forms part of the Transport for London Road Network (TLRN). The footway and carriageway must not be blocked during the development. All vehicles associated with the development must only park / stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions. In the event any Red Route dispensations are sought, these must be agreed with TfL in writing before the work.\r\rShould the applicant wish to carry out any work that would require a highway licence, for example for scaffolding or a hoarding on the footway whilst undertaking this work, separate licences may be required with TfL, please see, https://tfl.gov.uk/info-for/urban-planning-and-construction/our-land-and-infrastructure/highway-licences?intcmp=3496.\r\r\rRelevant Planning History \r- 23/02133/FUL - Erection of rear dormer roof extension to facilitate loft conversion. Granted 09.10.2023\r- 21/02104/FUL - Erection of front domer window and loft conversion to first floor flat. Granted on 15.11.2021 \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle of Development  \r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Refuse and Recycling\r- Fire Safety.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011. Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rPolicy DM13 (Housing Quality and Mix) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will, in appropriate locations, encourage the delivery of a variety of residential accommodation, including purpose built, managed student housing, affordable housing, specialist and supported housing.\r\rPolicy DM14 (Loss of Housing) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types) and, in particular, dwellings which are suitable for family accommodation. To protect existing family units that meet an identified need, the Council will, where necessary, limit the conversion of family units into houses in multiple occupation.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal seeks a change of use of the application site from a 5 bedroom, 5 person HMO (Use Class C4) to a Sui Generis HMO for up to 8 people. The proposal includes internal alterations.\r\rIt is noted that the property has a lawful use as a 5-bedroom House of Multiple Occupancy (Class C4) for a maximum of 5 residents, and the building is currently in use for this purpose.\r\rAs such, the proposed development would result in the provision of an additional residential accommodation and would not result in a loss of dwellinghouse capable of occupation by a family (Use Class C3).\r\rThe proposal seeks planning permission for 8 bed HMO use for up to 8 people. The policies of the current Development Plan do not preclude such types of development. It is considered that the proposed development would be compatible with, and would not change, the primary use of the site as a residential property albeit in a different use class. The proposal is considered acceptable in principle, subject to compliance with other development plan policies.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rOfficer comment: It is noted that Kingston Upon Thames guidance on HMO room sizes (updated Nov 2023) shows that the minimum requirement for room space is 6.5sqm for HMO that has a separate communal lounge which is not a kitchen. The submitted details demonstrated a 21.90sqm communal room which includes a kitchen, dinner and living space and the proposed 8 rooms would be above the space standards of 6.5sqm, falling in line with the Kingston Guidance. The proposed development would also align with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 as the floor area requirement for a one-bed space single bedroom is 7.5sqm.\r\rThe proposed new rooms will have a floor-to-ceiling height that would also staify the requirements of 2.3m, set out in the Kingston Guidance for House of Multiple Occupation Standards. \r\rThe accommodation as a whole is considered to be of practical layout and would retain communal facilities including a kitchen, dining room, bathrooms, lounge and external amenity space, ensuring an acceptable standard of living for future occupants.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that the proposed dormer windows would not be set in from the eaves by at least 500mm and that the dormer would be a slightly odd addition in the vicinity. However, it would be installed at the rear of the corner parade of shops and would not be visible from Robin Hood Way and therefore would not result in any impact on the existing Robin Hood Way street scene. Additionally, the proposed design of the dormer is considered to be diminuitive in scale and in-keeping with the host property.  \r\rGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity \rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Given the siting of the dormer, it is considered that the proposal would not result in an overbearing effect. The proposed dormer would result in a slight increase in overlooking and loss of privacy to a small car parking area and yard area to the rear of the parade of shops. However, this area is already overlooked by the existing maisonettes and any increase in overlooking and loss of privacy, would not be significant.\r\rHighways\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013  seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the site has a PTAL score of 1b, there are bus stops located 300m away from its location. As such the site is considered fairly accessible to public transport.\r\rThe site has one (1) existing car parking space and none is being proposed by the developer. This is in line with the car free developments' Policy T6 (B) of the London Plan 2021.\r\rAccording to the development proposal, four (4) cycle parking spaces will be provided on the site. Based on the proposed eight (8) rooms, the number of cycle parking spaces should be increased to eight (8) to reflect the minimum cycle parking standards stipulated in Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 document, which is 1 space per studio or 1 person/1-bedroom. This requirement would be secure via condition in the event of an approval. \r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy require the provision of adequate waste and recycling facilities to be provided in a location that will cause minimal adverse impact upon the amenities of the local area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The property has a generous area to the front so that bins can be stored and then easily moved for collection. It is noted that the submitted site plan does not shows the proposed waste bins arrangement and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed facilities would be sufficient for 8 bed HMO. Officers would request further details of the proposed bins type and quantity and that the bins are contained within a ventilated enclosure, such details would be secure by condition.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
