    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate repeat works to repollard G.1 and the removal of T.1 is necessitated by the damage it is causing as seen on Google Street View. T.1 is a small tree and the greenery lost will easily be replaced by the remaining vegetation. Thus there is no requirement to replant as the tree is not covered by the TPO and there will be no space for a replacement planting.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove."
