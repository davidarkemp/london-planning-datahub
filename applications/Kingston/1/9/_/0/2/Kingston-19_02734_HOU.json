    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, any windows or rooflights in the eastern elevation (and situated on the first floor) shall be constructed so that no part of the framework less than 1.7m above finished floor level shall be openable. Any part below that level shall be fitted with, and retained in, obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and shall be replaced immediately in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The site comprises a two-storey, semi detached dwelling located on the south side of Orchard Road, which is a well-established residential area. The property is not listed nor is it within a conservation area and there are no other historic assets in the vicinity. To the side of the property is a detached garage and hardstanding to the front provides off-street parking space. The adjoining property at No. 16 Orchard Road has been extended from its original form with the erection of a two-storey side extension. There are a variety of designs to the neighbouring properties, which includes detached and semi-detached properties, as well as differing roof types. The property is located within Flood Zone 1, and therefore at a low risk of flooding, though it is within a locally designated critical drainage area.\r\r11 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and one letter of objection was received following the consultation period. The planning issue raised in the objection is summarised as follows:\r- Loss of privacy.\r\rThere is no planning history relevant to this application.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings;\r- Loss of parking space; and\r- The impact on the risk of flooding.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposal would involve the demolition of a detached garage, though it is considered that it does not possesses any significant architectural merit, so there is no objection to its loss. A two-storey side extension is proposed together with a hip-to-gable roof extension. The side extension would be set in from the side boundary with No. 20 Orchard Road and so a separation gap would be maintained between the two properties. The extension would also be flush with the front elevation of the property and in line with the main roof ridge, which would be at odds with the Residential Design Guide SPD. However, the extension at the adjoining property has a similar building line, so the repetition of this feature would create an appearance that is already evident in the streetscene. \r\rNotwithstanding this, the proposal includes the creation of a hip-to-gable extension which is not a feature of the adjoining property and would not achieve the symmetry that the Residential Design Guide seeks. However, the neighbouring property has extended fully to the side boundary and so the resultant roof pitch would not be replicated at the application site. Maintaining a separation distance to No.16 Orchard Road is a more prominent feature of the surrounding area than maintaining a symmetrical appearance between properties. This is because in the wider area there is a large variety of designs to the properties, including detached and semi-detached, hipped and pitch roofs as well as heights. Given the variety of designs to the neighbouring properties and the imbalance created by the extended neighbouring property, it is considered that the design of the hip-to-gable extension in this case would not have an adverse impact upon the character and appearance of the area.\r\rAt the rear of the property, a dormer roof extension is proposed. It would be set in from the sides of the property and the distances above and below the eaves and ridge would ensure that it appears as a subservient feature within the rear roofslope of the property.  \r\rConsequently, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThere is a window within the side elevation of No. 20 Orchard Road, though it is unclear what room this serves. However, given that it already faces the side elevation of the application property and a separation distance would be maintained, it is considered that neither the outlook from this window, or the amount of natural light it receives, would be compromised as a result of the development. At the rear of the property, the proposed dormer would introduce a number of windows to the property which could lead to an incrteased sense of overlooking at neighbouring properties. However, it is considered that the resultant level would be no greater than to be expected when properties are aligned in this manner in well-established residential areas.\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. The proposal would involve the loss of the existing garage, and whilst a garage space is identified on the plans, it would not be of an adequate size to qualify as a parking space. However, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate an off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10. The garage space would also provide secure cycle storage space in line with policy T5 of the London Plan (2021).\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 1 and so is at a low risk of flooding, it is however within a locally designated critical drainage area. Given the scale and nature of the proposal, it is not considered that the risk of flooding would be increased as a result and therefore the proposal would be in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
