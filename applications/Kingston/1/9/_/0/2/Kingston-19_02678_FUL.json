    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of extensions and alterations at ground and loft floor levels.\r\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rThe key issues in the assessment of this application are:\r-The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; \r-The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers; and,\r-The impact of the development on the transport network.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe alterations to the front and side elevations of the building would be minimal and would be in keeping with the character and appearance of the property, as well as of a subordinate and proportionate nature. The alterations to the rear of the building would be more significant but officers consider the overall design approach to be appropriate.\r\rThe proposed extensions and alterations, with the exception of the removal of the garage door, would concern only the rear of the property. As a result, they would not be readily visible from any public vantage points and their impact on the character and appearance of the area would be limited.\r\rThe proposed single storey rear extension would extend across the original part of the rear elevation to a depth of approximately 5m and a height of approximately 3.5m. Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD states that single storey rear extensions should generally be no more than 3m to 3.5m in depth and no more than 3m in height for a flat roof or 3.3m in height for a parapet roof.\r\rHowever, the purpose of this guidance, in visual terms, is to ensure that single storey rear extensions appear as subordinate and proportionate additions to the host dwelling. In this case, the host dwelling is of a substantial size, such that officers consider it could readily accommodate a single storey rear extension of the dimensions proposed. Officers also consider that an extension of this size would be read clearly as an extension and would remain subordinate to the main part of the house.\r\rThe proposed hip-to-gable conversion would see the hipped original rear roof slope extended out to form a gable. Paragraph 4.29 of the Residential Design SPD states that proposals to extend a hipped roof to a gable roof are not usually appropriate as they are often at odds with the existing character of a property.\r\rWhile officers do indeed consider that the gable roof in this case would be at odds with the existing character of the property, it would not be at odds with the character of surrounding properties, notably Nos. 17, 18, 32 and 50 Cromford Way, which have all seen hip-to-gable conversions of some form. Furthermore, the fact that this alteration would be somewhat hidden from public view would mean that it would have very little impact upon the character and appearance of the area.\r\rThe only alteration which would be readily visible from public vantage points is the replacement of the existing garage door with a window. While integrated garages are characteristic of dwellings in the area, they are not universally present and officers are satisfied that the alteration would be accommodated comfortably within the front elevation and would respect surrounding development.\r\rOverall, officers are satisfied that the proposed extensions and alterations would have an acceptable impact upon the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rIn terms of the impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers, officers once again note that the proposed single storey rear extension would exceed the dimensions recommended by the Residential Design SPD. However, the presence of an existing rear extension at No. 12 Cromford Way would mitigate any impacts on the occupiers of this property to an acceptable degree, while any impacts on the other immediate neighbours at No. 8 Cromford Way would be mitigated by the degree to which the extension would be set off the shared boundary.\r\rThe hip-to-gable conversion would only involve works above the existing footprint of the property and as a result would have a very limited impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers in terms of overbearing appearance and daylight/sunlight. An additional window would be introduced in the rear elevation at second floor level but this would offer materially similar views to those on offer from the existing first floor windows. As such, officers are satisfied that there would be no material loss of privacy as a result of the proposal.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers are satisfied that the proposal would have a very limited impact on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rTransport\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided.\r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe proposal would result in the loss of the existing garage, which is the most convenient location on the site to store bicycles. However, Officers note that the application property has a lockable side gate and easy access from the front to the back of the property is retained.  Furthermore, the rear garden is generous in size and has outbuildings.  Therefore, it is considered that ample bicycle storage, commensurate with the number of occupants, could be safely and securely accommodated on site, thereby promoting sustainable forms of transport.\r\rIn terms of car parking, the loss of the existing garage is noted as resulting in the loss of one off-street car parking space. The public transport accessibility level of the site is 1b, which represents a very poor level of access to public transport.\r\rThe existing driveway, which would be retained, is large enough to accommodate one car and this level of parking provision is in line with the requirements of policy T6.1 of the London Plan 2021 and the site is not located within a controlled parking zone. As a result, officers consider the retention of a single parking space as acceptable in this instance.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.",
    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\r27 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received raising the issue of the potential impact to neighbouring properties. This will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and is detailed below.\r\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - no objection \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Impact to the Fishponds Park Conservation Area.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would be of a depth and height that falls within the recommended parameters of the Residential Design SPD. As such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed rear extension would be built up the shared boundary with No. 9 Kings Charles Crescent, given that no windows are proposed to the side elevations, and the proposed development would be modest in scale, it would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 9 Kings Charles Crescent by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFurther, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties Nos. 1-24 Calder Court, there would be no adverse impact to the amenities of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, or loss of privacy. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The site is located within Fishponds Park Conservation Area. The significance of this area can be summarised as: The former mid18th century estate of The Fishponds, with the surviving core of the original house and part of the grounds laid out as a 20th century park. In addition there is a cohesive set of late 19th Century, 2 storey terraced artisan cottages, with small front gardens.\r\rAs noted above, officers conclude that the proposal would not result in any harm to the character and appearance of the area. It is acknowledged that the proposed works would relate to the rear of the dwelling and not be visible from the streetscene. Furthermore, the proposed development is of a proportionate and subordinate scale in relation to the host property, and as such would not harm the significance of the Fishponds Park Conservation Area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
