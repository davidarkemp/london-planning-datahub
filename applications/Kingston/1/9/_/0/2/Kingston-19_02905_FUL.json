    "The proposed development would not provide any three or more bedroom (family sized) units. Robust justification has not been provided to demonstrate that the provision of a minimum of 30% of the proposed dwellings as family sized units would be unsuitable or unviable. The development therefore would not provide a suitable mix of housing to support sustainable, inclusive and mixed communities, contrary to paragraph 72 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.8 of the London Plan (2016) and Policy DM 13 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposed development would not provide satisfactory standards of internal and external amenity space for its future occupants. It therefore conflicts with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (2016), Policies DM10 and DM13 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and Policies Guidance 13 and 14 of the Council's Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the necessary financial contributions and infrastructure to mitigate issues relating to highway safety, parking, crime, and refuse management, the scheme would not be regarded as a sustainable form of development, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 6.3 and 7.3 of the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS 7, DM 8, DM 9, DM 10  and IMP 3 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The application property itself is a two-storey cottage that sits within an extensively sized plot and is located adjacent to the north-east boundary of the site. The site is well screened from Kingston Hill by boundary treatment alongside the highway comprising a 2m high wall and fence as well as entrance gates.  The property is located within the Coombe Wood Conservation Area and is also within an Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\r6 neighbouring properties were notified of the application and no responses were received following the consultation period. \r\rThe following were also consulted:\rMalden & Coombe CAAC - No objection\rNeighbourhood Traffic Engineer - No objection\r\rThe planning history relevant to this application is:\r20/02393/HOU - Erection of single storey extension and replacement of first floor window with a double glazed triple timber sash window - under consideration.\r20/01334/HOU - Erection of single storey side/rear extension with associated changes to fenestration - granted August 2020.\r20/00759/HOU - Erection of first floor side extension with installation of 1no rooflight to rear roof slope - granted June 2020.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and\r- The impact of the proposal on highway safety.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.  In determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.   \r\rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.        \r                                  \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rThe proposal involves the demolition of an existing detached garage, which is not considered has as having any significant architectural merit and does not make a positive contribution to the character and appearance of the conservation area. Therefore there is no objection to its loss. Its replacement, whilst larger in size, would have a typical appearance of a domestic garage, and its hipped roof finish would limit its impact on the surrounding area. It would also be largely screened by the front boundary wall, and so is acceptable in design terms. The widened access will incorporate a sliding timber door, which is considered to be an appropriate feature. The development as a whole would preserve the character and appearance of the conservation area, and so accord with policies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Core Strategy. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe proposed garage would be located towards the front of the site and close to the northern boundary with the adjoining property known as Clover House. The hipped rof finish to the garage will limit the impact that it has on this property and so the residential amenity of this neighbour would not be compromised as a result of the development.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance.\r\rThere would be no adverse impact upon the level of off-street parking within the site and there are no objections to the widening of the access. Consequently, the proposal would not have an adverse impact upon highway safety along this part of Kingston Hill.",
