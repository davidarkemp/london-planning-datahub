    "Where a new extension is joined to an existing extension, under paragraph (ja) the limits in (e) to (j) apply to the total enlargement (being the proposed enlargement together with the existing enlargement).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rIn response to neighbour notification, 2 letters of objection have been received from a single property raising the following concerns:\r\r- The submitted Daylight/Sunlight Assessment is flawed;\r- Loss of daylight/sunlight;\r- Undue sense of unclosure\r- Mutual loss of privacy\r- Distress caused by construction works and damage to neighbouring property\r\rOfficer Note: Party Wall issues relating to property damage would be a civil matter and not for consideration as part of the current planning application. With reference to potential distress, noise disturbance and loss of privacy arising from the temporary construction phase, Officers do not consider that there would be any signficant or lasting adverse impact on neighbouring amenity arising from the construction works associated with the proposed domestic extension. It is also noted that the Local Authority has powers under The Control of Pollution Act 1974 to enforce against statutory nuisance, were a statutory nuisance to occur.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed extension would not strictly accord with the Residential Design SPD guidance in relation to depth, it is considered that it would appear subordinate and proportionate to the existing dwelling and would be of an appropriate design that would relate well to the existing building. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is noted that a similar proposal was previously refused on this site due to an unacceptable loss of daylight to a neighbouring habitable room. The current scheme has replaced the previously refused parapet roof (approximately 3.3m in height) along the shared boundary with adjoining No. 88 with a mono-pitched roof with an eaves height of 2.2m along the shared boundary. It is noted that permitted development for boundary treatment would allow a 2m high fence along the boundary. Within this context the proposed eaves height along the shared boundary is considered to be relatively modest and is considered sufficient to ensure no significant overbearing impact or undue sense of enclosure to No. 88. \r\rThe submitted Daylight and Sunlight Report indicates that while there would be a loss of daylight to habitable room windows at No. 88 it would not be significant as the window would retain at least 0.9 times its former value with the new development in place. The orientation of the properties and position of the extension is such that there would be no signficant impact on sunlight to No. 88. In relation to No. 84, the set-back from the boundary and relatively modest depth is sufficient to ensure no significant adverse impact on neighbouring amenity.\r\rThe concerns raised in the submitted letters of objection about the robustness of the submitted Daylight and Sunlight Report are noted. However, Officers consider that the submitted Assessment provides an acceptable level of detail commensurate with the scale of the proposed development to assess the impact on neighbouring habitable rooms (a bathroom is not considered to be a habitable room).\r\rOverall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe site falls within fluvial Flood Zone 2. Officers are satisfied with the mitigation and flood resilience measures proposed by the applicant and consider that there would be no significant adverse impact on fluvial flood risk subject to the aforementioned measures being secured by planning condition.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Where a new extension is joined to an existing extension, under paragraph (ja) the limits in (e) to (j) apply to the total enlargement (being the proposed enlargement together with the existing enlargement).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r3 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- Flood risk assessment\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale and siting of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted flood risk form states that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate which is considered acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on flooding.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor side extension would measure approximately 2.3 metres in height to the eaves with a split gable end roof, approximately 3.5 metres in depth and 1.7 metres in width and would be set back 5 metres from the front elevation. The proposed roof form would relate well to the host property and would not exceed the ridge of the existing main roof, in accordance with Policy Guidance 36. Officers note that the ground floor is proposed to site flush with the front elevation of the main dwelling. Overall, it is considered that the proposed extensions would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition and would relate well to the host dwelling.\r\rGiven the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  No. 142 and No. 146 Somerset Avenue are the principal properties to be considered in relation to amenity. With regards to No. 142 Somerset Avenue there would be no adverse impact due to the nature and siting of the proposals in relation to the existing situation. Due to the limited depth of the proposed first floor side extension there would be no unacceptable loss of light to neighbouring habitable rooms of No.146 Somerset Avenue. Officers note that no windows or openings are proposed to the flank walls. Therefore, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2. Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts.\r\rOfficer Comment: The Flood Risk Form submitted by the applicant indicates that the proposed extension would be set no lower than the main dwelling and appropriate mitigation measures would not be required as part of the proposed development which are considered acceptable and in accordance with Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r2 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officer Comment: Whilst the proposed outbuilding would have a large footprint, officers note that there are a number of similar sized outbuildings that can be viewed in the immediate surrounding area.  As such the proposed outbuilding would not be out of character with the surrounding form and pattern of development.  Therefore, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting and height of the proposed outbuilding in relation to neighbouring properties and the absence of windows/openings in the rear and flank elevations, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

Officers note that the side extension has not been set back from the front elevation but note that similar extensions have previously been appoved at several addresses on Elgar Avenue including 129 Elgar Avenue (16/16593/HOU granted 27/10/2016) and 139 Elgar Avenue (05/16273/FUL granted 27/05/2005). The proposed roof form would relate well to the host property as extended and would not exceed the ridge of the existing main roof, in accordance with Policy Guidance 36.

Overall it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off street car parking spaces, therefore the proposal would comply with  Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
