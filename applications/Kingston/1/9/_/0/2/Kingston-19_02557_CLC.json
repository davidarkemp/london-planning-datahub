    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed two storey rear extension would project approx. 2.6m beyond the rear elevation. The separation distance approx. 1m to the adjoining properties would be retained. It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 34 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to the proposed roof form. However, it is considered that the proposed development would appear as an adequate addition in relation to the host dwelling. Furthermore, the proposed roof form that would continue the existing flat roof form and would not be highly visible within the street scene, therefore there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: It is noted that No. 75 Surbiton Hill Park benefits from the rear extension, given the separation distances it is considered that the proposed development would not have significant impact in terms of loss of daylight/sunlight or an overbearing effect in relation to No.75 Surbiton Hill Park. \r\rThe proposed development would meet BRE guidelines, passing the 45 degree test in relation to No. 79 Surbiton Hill Park due to separation distances (the proposal is set in by approx. 1m from the common boundary and No.79 side elevation is set in by approx. 1.3m from the common boundary). \r\rIt is noted that the proposed openings to the first floor on the side elevations would be obscured glazed. The proposed window to the ground floor on the side elevation would not result in an undue overlooking due to the existing boundary treatment.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
