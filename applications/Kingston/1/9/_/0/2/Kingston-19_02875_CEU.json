    "Based on the evidence provided it has been demonstrated on the balance of probabilities that the rear dormer window would be considered permitted development under the criteria set out in Schedule 2, Part, 1 Class c of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015",
    "Policy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate two off street car parking space(s), therefore the proposal would comply with the Policies DM9 and DM10.\r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph 192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r                                              \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash. The proposal would involve the replacement of all of the existing windows, which have a mixture of uPVC, aluminium and timber frames, with specialist heritage style \"timber effect\" uPVC models. Officers recognise the concern raised that the replacement windows would not be timber however, officers note that the original windows at the property would have been crittall and that adjacent properties of a similar age and style to the application property have replaced their own windows with high quality uPVC models. In this case the \"timber effect\" windows would be high quality. In light of this, officers consider that the replacement windows would not harm the significance of the conservation area. The remaining additions and alterations are relatively modest in overall scale and would not significantly alter the facade of the building, with the only notable change being the addition of a false pitch roof above the existing garage, which officers consider would respond more positively to the host dwelling than the existing flat roof. Overall, officers conclude that there would be no harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
