Granted planning permission, dated 23 April 2013. (Development not implemented).\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the erection of new dwelling house.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located to the side of No.6 Selsdon Close, a residential dwellinghouse and curtilage. \r\rThe surrounding area is predominantly residential in character and appearance. The site is not located in a conservation area and the building and curtilage are not statutorily or locally listed.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of accommodation;\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact on neighbouring residential amenity;\r- Highways and transportation;\r- Waste and recycling;\r- Sustainability;\r- Fire Safety;\r- Community Infrastructure Levy\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011.  Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rThe proposed development seeks to redevelop the site for residential use. \r\rThis application proposes 1no. additional residential unit, thereby making a small, but positive contribution towards these annual housing targets. In addition, the Council are currently unable to demonstrate a 5 year supply of land for the delivery of housing. As such, the 'tilted balance' and Paragraph 11(d) of the NPPF 2021 is a material planning consideration.\r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. The proposals show the proposed dwellinghouse to have 3 double-sized bedrooms and a study.\r\rAccording to the standard, a dwelling of this size arranged over three levels should have a minimum GIA of 108sqm.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would have a GIA of approximately 95sqm, representing undersized accommodation. \r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for this size of dwelling is 2.5sqm. \r\rThe proposed dwelling would not be provided with storage space to the required standards. \r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide two bedspaces, a double (or twin bedroom) has a floor area of at least 11.5m2. One double (or twin bedroom) is at least 2.75m wide. \r\rThe proposed bedrooms would be compliant with these space standards. \r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has not demonstrated that 75% of the floorspace of the accommodation would have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m. \r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be dual aspect with windows to the front and rear. Overall, the proposal is considered to represent a good standard of living accommodation for future occupiers of the proposed dwelling.\r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have 50m2 of private outdoor space (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third).\r\rThe proposed dwelling would benefit from approximately 28sqm of private outdoor amenity space. When assessed against criteria for new houses, the quantum of amenity space provision would fall significantly below guidance. \r\rOverall\rThe proposed dwelling would result in undersized accommodation, falling below the requirements of the nationally described space standards in terms of total floor space and built-in storage. The proposed floor to ceiling heights would not comply with London Plan standards. The outdoor amenity space would also be undersized in relation to Council's local guidance. Overall, officers conclude that the proposed dwelling would offer a poor standard of accommodation.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites. \r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThe application site currently serves as a small break in the built form between the row of terrace townhouses upon entering Selsdon Close and those dwellings further into the development, providing some, albeit relatively minor, visual relief. Officers note that there is a relatively consistent rhythm to the streetscene with the application site set within a short row of three townhouses with each end property as a mirror image flanked by single-storey garage structures. Whilst it is regrettable that the symmetry of the built form would be lost by way of the proposals, Officers do not have in-principle objection to the redevelopment of the site. Notwithstanding, the roof line would be set down 1m from that of the neighbouring dwellings and the fenestration would not align with the window placement of the neighbouring row of dwellings. As such, the proposed development would not adequately respect the general pattern and form of development of the neighbouring properties. It is considered that the proposal would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and at odds with the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOverall, the proposal would detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rPolicy Guidance 17 and Policy Guidance 18 set out the Council's method for the assessment of daylight and sunlight. New development should be designed so that new buildings or extensions to existing buildings stand a reasonable distance from the boundary of the property so as not to block an unreasonable amount of light from any existing windows of neighbouring properties. As such, new development will be assessed against the 45degree and 25degree rules, as set out in the British Research Establishment's 'Site layout planning for daylight and sunlight: a guide to good practice' 2011.\r\rPrivacy\rThe side facing windows proposed to the flank elevation at ground floor (serving a wc which would be obscure-glazed) and second floor (to serve a landing area). The windows to the front and rear elevations would be commensurate to those which exist to the terrace of dwellings and as such would not present materially different or harmful level of overlooking or loss of privacy to those properties to the rear.\r\rOfficers are satisfied that the proposal would not give rise to any materially harmful loss of privacy.\r\rDaylight and Sunlight\rThe proposed development by virtue of its built footprint, and siting in relation to the neighbouring properties would not project further than the rear building line of the donor property, No 6 Selsdon Close.\r\rOverall, this is considered to be a satisfactory relationship.\r\rVisual Intrusion and Outlook\rThe proposed dwellinghouse is shown to be three-storeys. The proposed roof line would be set approximately 1m lower than the ridge height of neighbouring properties on this row (i.e. No's 2 - 6 Selsdon Close).\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be set approximately 15m distance from the front elevations of those dwellings which face the site to the west (i.e. No's 25-29 odd inclusive). This would comply with the Council's guidance on separation distances. The proposed dwelling would be set approximately 18m distance from the rear elevation of No. 8 positioned to the rear of the application site. Council's guidance on separation distances advises that no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms. Given the existing relationship of the terraced properties adjacent to which the proposed dwelling would form part, this deviation in the separation distance to No. 8 to the rear is considered acceptable. \r\rOverall, the overall scale and massing of the proposed dwelling would not result in materially harmful impact on the outlook from those properties to the rear or side. \r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rAccess\rThe existing dropped kerb vehicular access to the application site would be utilised to serve the proposed dwelling. However, the proposed level of car parking would intensify to a total of 4no. car parking spaces (i.e. two to serve the proposed new dwelling and two to serve No. 6). Given the corner position of the site, existing density of the development of Selsdon Close and number of potential daily vehicular movements and the need for cycle and refuse/recycling storage to the frontage to serve the newly proposed dwelling and No. 6, Officers are not convinced that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site is located within a controlled parking zone. The site is located in an area with a PTAL rating of 4 (good). Table 10.3 (Maximum Residential Parking Standards) of the London Plan (2021) sets out a maximum car parking provision in Outer London areas with a PTAL 4 of up to 0.5-0.75 spaces per dwelling for 3+ bedroom units.\r\rThe site is located within a controlled parking zone (Zone S - Selsdon Close; operational Mon-Fri excl. bank holidays 10am-4pm). In the absence of a signed legal agreement to prevent occupiers or visitors to the proposed unit from obtaining a residents parking or visitors parking permit to mitigate any parking pressures, the proposed development would not comply with Paragraph 107 of the NPPF 2021, Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.  \r\rThe proposed plans show that 2no. off-street car parking spaces would be provided to the front of the dwelling. This therefore represents an overprovision that would encourage vehicle use. In turn this could lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. \r\rTherefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy T6 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. \r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards.\r\rDevelopment proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for two cycle parking spaces. There are no cycle parking spaces shown on the proposed plans. This is contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 and moderate weighting is given to this deficit against the proposals.  \r\rWaste and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rWhere containers need to be permanently stored to the front of a property, they should be housed in dedicated storage structures, which should be sited sensitively and where appropriate, well screened and appropriately landscaped so as to preserve and enhance the character of the street scene. In general, waste stores, typically containers, should not be sited to project forward of the established building line. A dedicated waste store should be constructed of materials appropriate to its context, particularly where the development site is in a sensitive location, for example a conservation area.\r\rBin storage is not shown on the plans and officers do not consider there would be sufficient space for the storage of refuse/recycling containers to the frontage. This is afforded significant weighting against the proposals.\r\rSustainability\rParagraph 157 of the NPPF 2021 requires new development to take account of landform, layout, building orientation, massing and landscaping to minimise energy consumption.\r\rPolicy SI2 of the London Plan 2021 requires all new major developments to be zero carbon. However, it does not set any requirements for minor developments.\r\rPolicy DM1 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires all new residential developments to achieve Code for Sustainable Homes Level 6. However, the Code for Sustainable Homes was withdrawn by the Government in 2015.\r\rPolicy DM3 requires development proposals to take into consideration the requirements for climate change adaptation, including through the reduction of potable water consumption.\r\rThe proposed dwelling would be required to secure the required level of water efficiency and CO2 reductions. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rCommunity Infrastructure Levy\rThe application would also be liable to pay Mayoral CIL (MCIL2) currently set at £60 per square metre. The development is liable for payment of the Community Infrastructure Levy (\"CIL\") and falls within Zone 2, for which the charge is £130 per square metre. \r\rThe payment of CIL is a material consideration in determining planning applications because it will provide for new infrastructure to mitigate any associated impacts arising from the development.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016), Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rSignificant weight is given in the assessment of the proposals providing for one net additional residential dwellinghouse. \rHowever, Officers find that the proposed development would provide for poor living accommodation for future occupiers of the property, in terms of its undersized internal accommodation, when assessed against national space standards, substandard built in storage, substandard floor to ceiling heights which do not comply with Policy D6 of the London Plan 2021 and undersized external amenity space for the proposed dwelling when assessed against the Council's local standards set out in the Council's Residential Design SPD. These matters are given significant weighting against the proposals in the overall assessment.\r\rThe proposed development would not adequately respect the general pattern and form of development of the neighbouring properties. As such, the proposal is assessed as detracting from the character and appearance of the surrounding area and would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. This is ascribed moderate weighting against the proposals in the overall assessment.\r\rThe proposed development is found to be acceptable in terms of impact upon neighbouring amenity. This is a neutral matter.\r\rOfficers find the vehicular access to be of concern in terms of its impact upon highway safety, particularly given the corner position of the site, existing density of the development of Selsdon Close and number of potential daily vehicular movements, as well as the need for cycle and refuse/recycling storage to the frontage to serve the newly proposed dwelling and No. 6. This matter is given significant weighting against the proposals in the assessment.\r\rThe proposed level of parking represents an overprovision that would encourage vehicle use. In turn this could lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore, the proposed development would be in conflict with Policy DM9 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012. Officers assign significant weighting against the proposals in this regard.\r\rThe applicant has failed to promote modes of sustainable transport in the proposals with regards to cycle parking. This is afforded moderate weighting against the proposals.\r\rNo refuse and recycling storage provision is shown for the proposed dwelling and insufficient information has been provided for officers to be satisfied that there would be sufficient space to the frontage to adequately accommodate this, together with cycle parking and car parking given that frontage would be shared with No. 6, adjacent. This is contrary to Policy CS9 and Policy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013. \r\rIn conclusion and on balance, the delivery of one additional residential dwelling is considered not to demonstrably outweigh the disbenefits associated with the standards of living accommodation, character and appearance, highways and transportation and refuse/recycling provision.\r\rAccordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be refused.\r",
    "Consultations\r25no. surrounding properties were notified of the proposed development. Two representations received. The representations object to the proposals with concerns as follows:\r\r-\tPrinciple of conversion to smaller homes\r-\tCar parking as proposed would be impractical\r\rOfficer comment: Duly noted. Please refer to body of the report for detailed assessment of the proposals.\r\rProposal\rThis application seeks full planning permission for the conversion of semi-detached four-bedroom house into a three-bedroom house and a two-bedroom annex, with associated amenity space.\r\rSite and Surroundings\rThe application site is located on the eastern side of Raeburn Avenue, Tolworth. The site is occupied by a two-storey, four-bedroom semi-detached dwellinghouse with attached garage along the northern boundary. There is a modest two-storey side extension on the northern elevation. \r\rThe site is not located in a conservation area and the buildings and curtilage are not statutory or locally listed.\r\rPlanning History\r22/00634/FUL - Conversion of existing detached 4 bedroom dwelling  into 2no.x maisonettes (1no.x 3 bedroom and 1no.x 2 bedroom) with garden space. Refused planning permission, dated 27 April, 2022 for the following reasons:\r1.\tThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information / evidence to demonstrate that the proposed development would meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers are not able to conclude that the development would provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r2.\tThe proposed accommodation would fail to comply with the minimum internal space standards in terms of built in storage space for 2no. two-storey, 2-bedroom flats set out in Table 3.1 of Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r3.\tThe applicant has failed to provide sufficient information to demonstrate that the rear garden areas would meet Council's required standards relating to amenity space, contrary to Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy, 2012 and Policy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD, 2013.\r\r4.\tThe proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r5.\tThe proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r6.\tThe proposals would result in the loss of 3-bedroom accommodation, suitable for family occupation, at a time when the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 identifies a significant need for such accommodation in the Borough. The proposals are therefore found to be contrary to RBK Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 and Policy DM13 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.\r\r22/01415/FUL - Conversion of semi-detached four-bedroom house into three-bedroom house and a two-bedroom annex, with associated amenity space. Refused planning permission, dated 23 June 2022. Reasons for refusal as follows:\r1.\tThe proposed development would not meet the required floor to ceiling height across the proposed accommodation in line with internal space standards, set out in the London Plan 2021, as such, Officers conclude that the development would not provide a good standard of internal accommodation for future residents. As such, the proposal would be contrary to Policy DM10 of the RBK Core Strategy 2012 and Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r2.\tThe proposed development would have an overprovision of parking and this is likely to lead to increased vehicle movement that could exacerbate existing congestion levels on the local highway network and prejudice highway safety. Therefore the proposal would not accord with Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\r3.\tThe proposed development would not provide the required minimum quantum of cycle spaces to adequately serve the development and, as such, would be contrary to Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\r4.\tThe proposals would result in the loss of 3-bedroom accommodation suitable for family occupation, at a time when the Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 identifies a significant need for such accommodation in the Borough. The proposals are therefore found to be contrary to RBK Strategic Housing Market Assessment 2016 and Policy DM13 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy, April 2012.\r\rPlanning Considerations\rThe key planning considerations in this case are as follows:\r- The principle of the development;\r- The standard of accommodation;\r- The character and appearance of the area;\r- The amenities of neighbouring occupiers;\r- Transportation; \r- Refuse and recycling; and \r- Fire Safety\r\rPrinciple of Development\rThe site is in an established residential area and its use for residential purposes is well established. The proposals would see alterations to the existing residential dwellinghouse and the formation of annexe accommodation. \r\rStandard of Accommodation\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF, 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 sets out the standards for new housing within London, in terms of overall gross internal area (\"GIA\"), built-in storage space, bedroom sizes and ceiling heights. Housing development should be of high quality design and provide adequately-sized rooms, with comfortable and functional layouts which are fit for purpose and meet the needs of Londoners without differentiating between tenures. Policy DM13 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that the Council will expect proposals for new residential development to demonstrate that the scheme has been designed to provide adequate internal space appropriate to the intended number of occupants. \r\rGIA\rThe nationally described space standard provides overall gross internal area (\"GIA\") requirements for various sizes of dwelling. No. 40 would be a 3-bedroom, 5-person dwellinghouse and othe annexe accomodation is proposed to a 2-bedroom, 3-person dwelling (the latter as annexe accommodation). However, for reasons of floorspace deficiencies is instead assessed as a 1-bedroom, 2-person dwellinghouse.\r\rThe proposed units (dwelling and annexe accomodation) would present accommodation above the minimum space standards.\r\rBuilt-In Storage\rThe standard also provides requirements for built-in storage space. The corresponding minimum standard for storage is between 1.5 and 2.5sqm. Each of the units would meet these requirements.\r\rBedrooms\rIn order to provide one bed space, a single bedroom should have a floor area of at least 7.5sqm and be at least 2.15m wide and in order to provide two bed spaces, a double (or twin) bedroom should have a floor area of at least 11.5sqm.\r\rOne double (or twin) bedroom should be at least 2.75m wide, with every other such bedroom being at least 2.55m wide. \r\rAll of the double-sized bedrooms would comply with minimum space standards. Officers note that the front room to the annexe (No. 40a) labelled as a bedroom/study would fall below minimum space standards for a single bedroom by 0.5sqm. However, it would function as a study, and given this is titled as a study room, officers find this to be acceptable, subject to the imposition of a condition preventing use of this room as a bedroom. \r\rCeiling Height\rAny dwelling should also have a floor to ceiling height of at least 2.5m across 75% of its floor area, in recognition of the fact that ceiling heights are an important element in the design of a dwelling in the unique circumstances of London.\r\rHigher ceilings can help to offset issues associated with London's distinct higher densities and the effects of climate change by positively impacting on how spacious, light and comfortable the dwelling is. They can also improve the amount and quality of natural light and ventilation, and provide flexibility in the use of a room.\r\rThe applicant has provided an existing section to show the floor to ceiling heights. The ground floor is 2.5m and the first floor has a floor to ceiling height of 2.3m. As such, 75% of the floorspace of the accommodation would not have a floor to ceiling height of 2.5m, contrary to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rAspect, Outlook, Lighting and Ventilation\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires that developments have regard to the amenities of occupants in terms of outlook.\r\rStandard 29 of the Mayor's Housing SPG 2016 states that developments should minimise the number of single aspect dwellings. Single aspect dwellings that are north facing, or exposed to noise levels above which significant adverse effects on health and quality of life occur, or which contain three or more bedrooms should be avoided.\r\rThe subtext to Policy D6 of the London Plan, 2021 goes onto say that dual aspect dwellings with opening windows on at least two sides have many inherent benefits. These include better daylight, a greater chance of direct sunlight for longer periods, natural cross ventilation and a greater capacity to address overheating, mitigating pollution, offering a choice of views, access to a quiet side of the building, greater flexibility in the use of rooms, and more potential for future adaptability by altering the use of rooms. Where possible, the provision of dual aspect dwellings should be maximised in a development proposal.\r\rThe units, 1 dwelling and 1 annexe accomodation, would both be dual aspect with windows provided to the front (west) and rear (east) elevations. Officers consider that the proposed units would be afforded sufficient natural light, good outlook and ventilation for the size of dwelling, commensurate with other dwellings along Raeburn Avenue. \r\rOutdoor Space\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy requires developments to ensure adequate private and/or communal amenity space.\r\rPolicy Guidance 13 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 states that although levels of private amenity space may vary considerably in different character areas, each new dwelling should have 50m2 of private outdoor space (plus an extra 5m2 for each bedroom after the third).\r\rThe proposed plans indicate that each unit would be provided with private external rear garden space. The submitted proposed site plan is annotated to demonstrate that each unit would be provided well in excess of Council's minimum standards for external amenity space. \r\rOverall\rThe layout of the accommodation is considered to represent logical internal floor space with good light, outlook and ventilation and good-sized internal and external accommodation. However, the ceiling heights to the first floor would not meet the required standards. On balance, however, given the proposals relate to a conversion of an existing house and not a new build development, Officers are satisfied that the proposed units, 1 dwelling and annexe accomodation would provide for good quality overall standard of living accommodation for future occupiers. Similarly, the deficit in the floorspace of the front-facing ground floor room to the annexe accommodation to be used as a functional bedroom is on balance considered acceptable, subject to a condition restricting its use.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy D3 (Optimising Site Capacity Through the Design-Led Approach) of the London Plan (2021) sets out that all development must make the best use of land by following a design-led approach that optimises the capacity of sites.\r\rDevelopment proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. Spaces and buildings should maximise opportunities for urban greening to create attractive resilient places that can also help the management of surface water.\r\rAccordingly, Policy CS8 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states the Council's intention to protect the primarily suburban character of the Borough, its existing buildings and areas of high quality and historic interest from inappropriate development. The Council will seek opportunities for sensitive enhancement in these areas and in areas of poorer environmental quality, where character has been eroded or needs improving. The assessment of development proposals will be guided by the Borough Character Study and the Residential Design SPD, ensuring that new development:\r- Recognises distinctive local features and character\r- Has regard to the historic and natural environment\r- Helps enhance locally distinctive places of high architectural and urban design quality\r- Accords with neighbourhood \"strategies for delivery\" set out under \"Character, Design and Heritage\"\r- Relates well and connects to its surroundings Policy DM10 identifies the most essential elements in contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. These include:\r- Prevailing development typology, including housing types, sizes and occupancy\r- Prevailing density of the surrounding area\r- Scale, layout, height, form (including roof forms) and massing\r- Landscape setting and features\r- Plot width and format, which includes spaces between buildings\r- Building line build-up, set-back and front boundary\r- Typical details and key features such as roof forms, window format, building materials and design detailing of elevations, existence of grass verges, etc.\r\rThis application does not propose any external changes in the form of extensions/additions. All of the proposed changes relate to the internal accommodation. \r\rThe proposal would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rParagraph 130 of the NPPF 2021 states that planning decisions should ensure that developments will create places that are safe, inclusive and accessible and which promote health and well-being, with a high standard of amenity for existing and future users.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan (2021) requires new development to deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity. Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) is clear that development proposals should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rPolicy Guidance 16 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 considers neighbouring amenities in more detail. It states that for all new residential development (including conversions and changes of use), the priority should be to provide and protect acceptable levels of amenity for both existing and future residents. On smaller sites, the prevailing character of the area may dictate what separation distance will be but in general, minimum separation distances should be maintained using the following standards:\r- A separation distance of no less than 21m shall normally be maintained between facing windows of habitable rooms\r- A separation distance of 7.5m shall be maintained between new habitable room windows and the boundary to neighbouring properties or 15m between new habitable room windows and the flank wall of a neighbouring property\r- Where the site topology, landscape features or adequate screening is in place it may be appropriate to relax these distances\r- In all cases, developers should demonstrate, through a design and access statement, how adequate visual and acoustic privacy will be achieved - consistent with the Mayor's Housing SPG paras 2.3.30/Standard 5.1.1 \r\rThe proposed development by virtue of its size, siting and design in relation to the neighbouring properties would not cause any significant material harm to the outlook, daylight/sunlight provision or privacy of the neighbouring occupiers.\r\rTransport\rParagraph 110 of the NPPF 2021 requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; the design of streets, parking areas, other transport elements and the content  of associated standards reflects current national guidance, including the National Design Guide and the National Model Design Code; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rParagraph 111 goes on to say that development should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rParagraph 112 says that applications should give priority first to pedestrian and cycle movements, both within the scheme and in neighbouring areas, and second to facilitating access to high quality public transport, with layouts that maximise the catchment area for such services. They should also: address the needs of people with disabilities and reduced mobility; create places that are safe, secure and attractive, which minimise the scope for conflicts between pedestrians, cyclists and vehicles; allow for the efficient delivery of goods and access by service and emergency vehicles; and be designed to enable charging of ultra-low emission vehicles in safe, accessible and convenient locations.\r\rPolicy T4 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should reflect and be integrated with current and planned transport access, capacity and connectivity. Where appropriate, mitigation, either through direct provision of public transport, walking and cycling facilities and highways improvements or through financial contributions, will be required to address adverse transport impacts that are identified. Development proposals should not increase road danger.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 states that development proposals should have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected.\r\rAccess\rThe vehicular access to the site would remain as existing and it is not considered that its use would materially intensify. Officers are therefore satisfied that the proposal would have an acceptable impact on highway safety.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. Car-free development should be the starting point for all development proposals in places that are (or are planned to be) well-connected by public transport, with developments elsewhere designed to provide the minimum necessary parking ('car-lite').\r\rThe maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals. Where provided, each motorcycle parking space should count towards the maximum for car parking spaces at all use classes.\r\rPolicy CS7 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's intention to manage on and off-street parking provision to promote sustainability and residential amenities.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rThe site has a public transport accessibility level (PTAL) rating of 2, which represents a poor level of accessibility by means of public transport. Policy 6.1 within Table 10.3 of the London Plan 2021 requires the proposed development to have a maximum of 0.75 car parking spaces per 2-bedroom dwelling - this would equate to 1.5 spaces.\r\rThe application site currently provides off-street car parking for 2no. vehicles. The existing garage is not capable of accommodating modern standard vehicles. The proposals provide for 2no. car parking spaces to serve the dwelling and ancillary annexe accommodation to its frontage. As such, there would be no net increase to the total amount of off-street car parking and in this way would be acceptable.\r\rCycle Parking\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan, 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided where the application of the minimum standards would result in a lower provision. Cycle parking should be designed and laid out in accordance with the guidance contained in the London Cycling Design Standards.\r\rDevelopment proposals should demonstrate how cycle parking facilities will cater for larger cycles, including adapted cycles for disabled people.\r\rApplying Table 10.2 to the proposal results in a requirement for a minimum of 3.5no. cycle parking spaces to serve the development. The application proposes 5no. cycle spaces be provided to the front of the proposed dwellings. This would be an appropriate quantum of provision to serve the proposed development, in accordance with Policy T5 of the London Plan, 2021.\r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicy CS9 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires integrated, well-designed recycling facilities to be incorporated into all new developments.\r\rPolicy Guidance 22 of the Council's Residential Design SPD 2013 provides further guidance on this matter, stating that the storage of waste facilities should be integral to the design of dwellings and located so that they can be accessed conveniently for residents. Ideally, they should be to the rear of the property, provided that a route between the front and rear of the property can be provided that does not go through the house.\r\rThe plans show that the waste and recycling bins will be stored within the front forecourt to the application site. A  condition is recommended to ensure that these bins are contained within suitably high-quality, ventilated enclosure(s) and details submitted to the local planning authority for assessment and approval. \r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has not submitted a Fire Safety Strategy, however, the plans include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through condition. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rConclusion / Planning Balance \r\rOfficers find that the proposed development would provide for good quality living accommodation in terms of floorspace. \r\rThe proposals have been assessed as acceptable in terms of impact to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and area and impact to neighbouring amenity. These are given neutral weighting.\r\rThe proposed level of parking has been adjusted from previous scheme iterations to now be in line with maximum car parking standards as set out in the London Plan, 2021. Cycle parking provision has, meanwhile, been increased from previous scheme iterations to accord with policy standards. \r\rSubject to the imposition of a condition requiring the annexe to be used as ancillary accomodation, as well as a compliance condition to restrict the use of the front-facing ground floor room in the annexe (to prevent its use as a bedroom), the proposed development as put forward in this application is considered to be acceptable. \r\rIn conclusion and on balance, the previous reasons for refusal have been overcome/address in this planning submission. \rIt is therefore recommended that the application be granted.  \r\rRecommendation\rThat planning permission be GRANTED.\r",
