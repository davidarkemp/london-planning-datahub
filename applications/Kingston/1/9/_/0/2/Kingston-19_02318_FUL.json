    "The proposed development by virtue of its design and roof form would create a dominant and incongruous feature that would be visually intrusive in the streetscene and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with Paragraph 127 of the NPPF, 2018, Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan, 2016, Core Strategy policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.",
    "The proposed development fails to provide any family units of accommodation.  As such the proposed development would not provide an appropriate mix of unit types, thereby failing to comply with policies 3.5 of the London Plan 2016, Policies DM10 and DM13 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012. \r\r",
    "The lack of off-street car parking provision is considered to lead to an unacceptable adverse impact upon traffic congestion in the area and as a result would impede the free-flow of vehicular movement and prejudice highway and pedestrian safety, thereby conflicting with 6.13 of the London Plan, 2016 and Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
