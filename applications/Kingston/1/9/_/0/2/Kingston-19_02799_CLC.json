    "That the applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that the condition, as noted above, is fully discharged.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe application seeks the erection of a part single storey, part two storey side and rear extension.\r\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extensions would be large in scale and would have a significant impact on the appearance of the property. The single storey element would greatly exceed the depth recommended by the Council's Residential Design SPD, extending to a maximum depth of 6m beyond the original rear elevation of the dwelling. This would normally be considered excessive but because the neighbour to the north-west benefits from a 6m deep rear extension and the property to the south-east benefits from a 3m deep rear extension, a 6m deep extension would not appear out of place. This view is strengthened by the fact that this element of the proposal would not be readily visible from public vantage points.\r\rIn contrast, the two storey element and proposed side dormer would be highly visible. The most noticeable feature of the side extension would be its irregular shape and intirely unconvincing false pitch roof. It is however noted that it would accord with much of the relevant guidance in the Residential Design SPD, for example in the degree of set back from the front wall and the side boundary, and the degree of set down from the ridge of the main roof. \r\rThe presence of the existing flat roof dormer at 25 Blakes Avenue means that the proposed dormer would not disrupt the symmetry of the pair to any great degree, and this would also serve to somewhat shield the side extension behind it. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposal would, on balance, have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The presence of the large extensions at both adjoining properties mean that the extensions would pass the 45 degree test in respect of the nearest habitable room windows and would not appear overbearing. While there may be some loss of light to windows on the side elevation of No. 29, it is considered that this would not be significant within the context of the prevailing pattern and form of development in the area.\r\rIn terms of loss of privacy, the proposed side facing first floor windows would give rise to unacceptable views over neighbouring properties if left unobscured. However, these would be secured as obscure glazed by condition. The remaining windows would offer similar views to the existing.\r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, and the Policies of the Core Strategy (2012).",
