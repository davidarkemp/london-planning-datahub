    "There have been amendments to the nationally set planning application fee regulations. Regulation 14 of the regulations has been amended to introduce a fee of Â£96, payable for all Notification of larger home extension Applications.\rYou have not paid the requisite fee and as such your application has been Refused.\r",
    "The applicant is advised that the Council will require the applicant to undertake a road and footway condition survey before construction begins. This will take the form of a joint inspection with a member of the Highways Operation Team and will involve a photographic record and visual observation of the roads, verges and margins. The same team will secure a deposit to ensure that repairing cost is covered should any damage result from the construction associated with this site.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe removal of a healthy tree under TPO would not be permitted in any eventuality, but in this case the reason given is that the woner wishes to plant a magnolia in it's stead. The trouble with this is that the Magnolia would not grow well in that location as it would be severly suppressed by the much large mature trees growing over it.\r\rRecommendation:\rConsent for lesser works as follows:\r\rT.2 Yew - 3m reduction in height & 2m holistic reduction of remaining crown to suitable growth points."
