    "Prior to occupancy of the development a BREEAM post construction review should be carried out within 1 year of construction of the development and a Final BREEAM Very Good certificate should be submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority. The post construction review and certificate will ensure that the best endeavours of the developer have been made to ensure the development has fully complied with the requirements of the BREEAM outstanding standard.\rReason: In the interests of sustainability and energy conservation as set out in Policies 5.2 (Minimising Carbon Dioxide Emissions) and 5.3 (Sustainable Design & Construction) of the London Plan (July 2011) and Policy DM1 (Sustainable Design and Construction Standards) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
