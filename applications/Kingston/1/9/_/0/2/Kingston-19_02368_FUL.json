    "Introduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2022.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rConsultations\r6no surrounding properties were notified  of the proposed development. No  letters of representation were received. \r\rProposal \rThe application seeks full planning permission for the erection of a single storey rear extension and new shower room, internal alterations and rear patio 3.0m deep and raised 0.15m (amended description).  \r\rApplication Site\rThe  site comprises detached dwelling. \r\rPlanning History\r24/01219/CPU -   Erection of a double hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with installation of 2nos. front rooflights to facilitate loft conversion.

Refused 25.03.24\r\r24/00191/CPU  - Erection of a single storey rear extension. Refused 25.03.24\r\rPlanning Assessment  \rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety \r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale , appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer comment : The proposal seeks  approval for the erection of a single storey rear extension, internal alterations and rear patio 3m deep and raised 0.15m. \r\rThe proposed single storey extension  would project a maximum depth of 4m along the shared boundary with  neighbouring no 40 Cranes Park  and 2.8m  on the opposing side.  It would have a width of 6.756m. It would have a flat roof with an eaves height of 2.88m  accommodating a  single rooflight. At the rear of the dwelling, the proposal also includes a 3m depth  patio laid in paving slabs which would be raised by 0.150m.  A new 2m high timber fence would be installed on the shared boundary  with neighbouring no 40 Cranes Park Avenue.  The proposed rear elevation would present bi folding doors leading out onto a patio  and a single window.  No fenestration is proposed on both proposed side elevations of the rear extension. \r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe principal property to consider in relation to amenity is neighbouring property at nos 36 and 40 Cranes Park Avenue. \r\rIn considering the impact of daylight at no 40 Cranes Park Avenue, the proposal would pass the BRE45  degree rule in relation to the closest habitable room window and there is an acceptable separation distance of 2.3m\r\rIn considering the impact of daylight at no 36 Cranes Park Avenue, the proposal would pass the BRE 45 degree rule in relation to the closest habitable room window and there is an acceptable separation distance of 2.3m .\r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Strategy.  Officers are satisfied that the proposal adequately meets the requirements of Policy D12(A). Ongoing compliance with the strategy would be secured through conditions, in the event of a favourable recommendation. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.\r\r\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",

The proposal would present a single storey wrap around 'L' shaped extension which would project a maximum depth of 6.9m beyond the existing rear elevation of the main dwelling and 2.9m beyond the existing outrigger.  Overall, the proposed extension would have a width  of 4.04m.\r\rThe proposed rear extension beyond the outrigger would present a dual pitch roof with a pitch roof height of 3.76m  accommodating 2no rooflights and an eaves height of 2.7m.   A single window is proposed on the proposed east elevation and  bi folding doors on the rear elevation. \r\rThe proposed materials would relate well to those of the existing dwelling.\r\rWithin the context of the existing built form on site and the siting of the single storey side extension, it is considered that the proposal would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition to the main dwellinghouse and that it would be acceptable from a character and design perspective.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.

Officers note the  existing window is the primary source of daylight  to the kitchen and secondary windows and glazed panel door are positioned on the side elevation.   Within this context, it is considered that there would be no significant loss of daylight to this neighbour.\r\rIn addition, Officers note a reduction in the separation distance between the proposed built form and the shared boundary with neighbouring no13 Rowlls Road from 2.03m to 0.8m. The proposed single storey side extension would have an eaves height of 2.5m  which would be not much greater than that of a shared boundary fence 2m which would have permitted development rights to be installed. \r\rOfficer Comment:  \rGiven the proportionate and subordinate nature  of the proposed development and its siting in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rFire safety \rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Reasonable Exception Statement.

    "Application Site: \r\rThe application relates to a 0.2 hectare site with a two-storey detached property that is currently in use as a car home, known as Milverton Nursing Home, located on the south of Ditton Road. \r\rIt has had various alterations and additions over the years to accommodate a growing number of residents. The front facade of the building is made up of a series of single and two storey bays with a mixture of materials including render, brick, hanging plain tiles, ornamental tiles and decorative wall features. The front entrance is framed by a two post open wooden porch and is accessed via a short steep ramp.\r\rThe site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area. It is not, nor is it located nearby, a statutory listed building and non-designated heritage asset. \r\rOne tree located on the rear of the site, near the boundary with No. 1 Rickards Close, is protected under a Tree Protection Order. \r\rProposal: \r\rAlterations to front entrance and facade, in addition to the replacement of the ramp access and canopy at Milverton Nursing Home, 99 Ditton Road, Surbiton KT6 6RJ. \r\rRelevant History: \r\rThe Nursing Home has been subject to multiple planning permissions for extensions and alterations since it was first established in 1985. \r\rConsultation: \r\rA notification was published in the local newspaper on 04.07.2024 and site notices were installed around the site. A total of 23 neighbours were consulted. No responses were received. \r\rSurbiton Conservation Area Committee was consulted and did raise any objections. \r\rCouncil's Conservation and Heritage Officer was consulted and did not raise any objections, subject to conditions. \r\rPlanning Considerations: \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r\r- Principle of Development \r- Character, Design and Impact on Heritage Assets\r\rPrinciple of development: \r\rThe Development Plan is generally supportive of people extending or altering their properties. The principle of development is supported, subject to details.\r\rCharacter, Design and Heritage Impacts: \r\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 requires that special attention shall be paid to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character or appearance of conservation areas. However, it is to be noted that Section 72 of the Act does not protect the setting of a Conservation Area.\r\rNPPF at para 205 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.\r\rNPP at para 207 states that where a proposed development will lead to substantial harm to (or total loss of significance of) a designated heritage asset, local planning authorities should refuse consent, unless it can be demonstrated that the substantial harm or total loss is necessary to achieve substantial public benefits that outweigh that harm or loss. \r\rPara 208 of the NPPF goes on to state where a development proposal will lead to less than substantial harm to the significance of a designated heritage asset, this harm should be weighed against the public benefits of the proposal including, where appropriate, securing its optimum viable use. \r\rPara 209 of the NPPF states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining the application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement will be required having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asse\r\rNPPF para 131 states the creation of high-quality, beautiful and sustainable buildings and places is fundamental to what the planning and development process should achieve.\r\rLP Policy D3 states that development should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. \r\rCS Policy CS8 and DM10 and the guidance in the Residential Design Guide SPD require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe alterations to the front facade is to the red brick facades on the first floor and would replace them with white render or ornamental hanging tiles in a colour to match the roof tiles. It would also involve the painting of the roof eaves black. The front porch will be replaced with a black oak framed porch. The alterations would be similar to existing features on the property and would not harm the character or appearance of the streetscape or Southborough Conservation Area. Council's Heritage and Conservation Officer has not raised any objections, subject to final material details being secured by condition to ensure they are high quality. \r\rThe replacement front ramp access and glass balustrade is to comply with relevant wheelchair accessibility standards. Officers find this alteration to the property to be acceptable to make the property more accessible and usable, subject to materials samples and specifications being secured by condition.\r\rConclusion:\r\rOfficers, having regard to the statutory duties in respect of Conservation Areas in the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 and the relevant paragraphs in the NPPF in relation to conserving the historic environment, are satisfied the proposal would preserve the character or appearance of Southborough Conservation Area.",

    "The application site is a two storey detached building located to the south-east of Kings Road, Kingston. The building is a House of Multiple Occupation (HMO).\r\r13 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to Excessive height or bulk of buildings, Inappropriate design/layout, Loss of light/Sunlight and Privacy.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Principle of Development  \r- The design of the proposed development.\r- Standard of Accommodation\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r- Refuse and Recycling\r- Fire Safety.\r\rPrinciple of Development\rPolicy CS10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy, 2012 sets out the Borough's housing targets as defined by the London Plan, 2011. Policy H1 (Increasing Housing Supply) of the London Plan (2021) sets ten-year targets for net housing completions that each local planning authority should plan for. Table 4.1 sets out the 10 year targets for net housing completions in each London Borough from 2019/20 - 2028/29). The requirement for Kingston is to deliver 9,640 homes in this 10 year period, which would equate to 964 net completions per annum.\r\rAs there is no 5-year housing land supply, paragraph 11 of the NPPF indicates that planning permission should be granted unless (i) the application of policies in this Framework that protect areas or assets of particular importance provides a clear reason for refusing the development proposed; or (ii) any adverse impacts of doing so significantly and demonstrably outweigh the benefits, when assessed against policies in this Framework taken as a whole. These considerations should be given considerable weight in the assessment of any forthcoming planning application.\r\rPolicy DM13 (Housing Quality and Mix) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will, in appropriate locations, encourage the delivery of a variety of residential accommodation, including purpose built, managed student housing, affordable housing, specialist and supported housing.\r\rPolicy DM14 (Loss of Housing) of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) sets out that the Council will resist the loss of existing accommodation (of all types) and, in particular, dwellings which are suitable for family accommodation. To protect existing family units that meet an identified need, the Council will, where necessary, limit the conversion of family units into houses in multiple occupation.\r\rOfficer comment: The proposal seeks permission for the construction of a single storey rear outbuilding annexe to accommodate an additional ensuite bedroom and a communal living area which will be used by the occupiers of the main house (5 bedroom HMO (Use Class C4)). \r\rIt is noted that the property has a lawful use as a 5-bedroom House of Multiple Occupancy (Class C4) and the building is currently in use for this purpose.\r\rThe proposed development would result in the provision of an additional residential accommodation and would not result in a loss of dwellinghouse capable of occupation by a family (Use Class C3).\r\rThe proposal seeks planning permission for 6-bed HMO use. The policies of the current Development Plan do not preclude such types of development. It is considered that the proposed development would be compatible with, and would not change, the primary use of the site as a residential property albeit in a different use class. \r\rStandard of Accommodation\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy advise that proposals should relate well to their surroundings and be of a high standard of design to achieve a more attractive, sustainable and accessible environment.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has not demonstrated the layout of the communal areas ( i.e kitchen or any other communal areas) within the main house on plan. It is noted that Kingston Upon Thames guidance on HMO room sizes (updated Nov 2023) shows that the minimum requirement for room space is 6.5sqm for an HMO that has a separate communal lounge which is not a kitchen. \r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed development would provide an additional room of approximately 9.3 sqm and a communal living space of approximately 12.8 sqm in line with the Kingston HMO Standards (2023). However, the proposed layout would be impractical, as the occupier(s) of the room would have to use an external route to access the communal kitchen. Additionally, the applicant has not sufficiently demonstrated the floor-to-ceiling height requirement of 2.3m, measuring from the eaves to the floor it appears as though the floor-to-ceiling height would be approximately 2.2m. \r\rOverall the accommodation is considered to have an impractical layout and an unacceptable floor-to-ceiling height, therefore would not ensure an acceptable standard of living for future occupants.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the proposal would have a large footprint, however, it would have a flat roof height of , maintain approximately 500mm from the neighbouring boundaries and given that it would be situated in a fairly substantial rear amenity area, officers consider that it would appear as a subordinate addition to the host property, and would not detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area.\r\rGiven the above the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design and there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area.\r\rAmenity \rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge the concerns raised regard the loss of light and privacy, however, given the siting of the proposed outbuilding at the end of the garden, it is considered that it would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. As a whole, the proposed building would not cause any substantial loss of sunlight to neighbouring amenity spaces.\r\rHowever, as mentioned above, it is noted that the occupiers of the proposed outbuilding and the main house would need to externally access the kitchen (main house) or the communal living area (outbuilding), as such this, would potentially constitute an unacceptable increase of noise levels. Therefore, As a whole, the proposed building would not cause any substantial loss of sunlight to neighbouring amenity spaces.\r\rHighways\rThe NPPF requires that in assessing applications for development, it is ensured that: appropriate opportunities to promote sustainable transport modes can be - or have been - taken up; safe and suitable access to the site can be achieved for all users; and any significant impacts from the development on the transport network (in terms of capacity and congestion), or on highway safety, can be cost effectively mitigated to an acceptable degree.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe.\r\rPolicies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013  seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rDevelopment should only be prevented or refused on highways grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or the residual cumulative impacts on the road network would be severe. Policies DM9 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy together with the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 seek to ensure that new development has regard to local traffic conditions and does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety and for proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer comment: Although the site has a PTAL score of 1b, there are bus stops located 500m away from its location and Kingston Railway within 1km. As such the site is considered fairly accessible to public transport. Additionally, the occupiers of No106 benefit from on-street permit parking if required.\r\rBased on the proposed 6 rooms, the number of cycle parking spaces should be 6 to reflect the minimum cycle parking standards stipulated in Policy T5 of the London Plan 2021 document, which is 1 space per studio or 1 person/1-bedroom. \r\rRefuse and Recycling\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy require the provision of adequate waste and recycling facilities to be provided in a location that will cause minimal adverse impact upon the amenities of the local area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The property has a generous area to the front so that bins can be stored and then easily moved for collection. It is noted that the submitted site plan does not show the proposed waste bins arrangement and it has not been demonstrated that the proposed facilities would be sufficient for 6 bed HMO. Officers would request further details of the proposed bins type and quantity and that the bins are contained within a ventilated enclosure, such details would be secure by condition in the event of an approval.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.)\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note the objection received from the Conservation Area Advisory Committee that recommends to retain the existing type of clay roof tiles. \r\rDuring the site visit Officers note that the immediate surrounding area contains high quality dwellings with predominantly slate roofs.\r\rOfficers also note significance of the application site and the immediate adjoining properties located within the Victoria Avenue Conservation Area:\r\r(Description of the Victoria Avenue Conservation area) \r\r'The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as an area of several cohesive groups of two storey red brick houses built between 1893 and 1904:\rIn 1894 houses began to be erected in Balaclava Road. Charles Adams, a local builder, was responsible for erecting all of the 17 villas. He constructed these houses in three phases between 1894 and 1898, with the houses of each phase being of the same design.\rThe group of five houses at the western end of Balaclava Road, No.'s 38 - 46 as well as no. 4 Endsleigh Gardens were the last works of Charles Adams, who commissioned the well known local architect Alfred Mason to design the five detached villas for him.'\r\rThe proposal would change the appearance of the roof, from a slate roof that is characteristic to the area to a tiled roof. It is noted that the cladding (roof slates) on the sides and front elevations of the existing side dormer would not be changed, which would not ensure high quality development.\r\rFurthermore, the existing and proposed drawings do not show the decorative roof ridge which is characteristic to the area, it is unclear whether it would be retained or lost like on some other properties.\r\rOverall, based on the submitted information, it is considered that the proposed materials would not be of an adequate appearance and quality and therefore it would not be suitable for a property situated within a Victoria Avenue Conservation Area. The proposal  would result in less than substantial harm to the conservation area which could not be outweighed by any public benefits.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:\r It is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire statement Form, which is acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling that falls within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area and the Kingston Town Centre, Area of Archaeological Significance.\r\rConsultations\rKingston Town CAAC comment: Objection unless revised as below - We are generally supportive of this PA, but roof lights to the new side extension should be conservation-type as they are partially visible from the public realm - this has not been specified in the PA & should be. Also, we would prefer existing UPVC windows to be replaced with traditional timber units even if largely confined to the rear of the property & hidden from public view.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representation has been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets.\r- Flood Risk Assessment\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey infill rear and side extension would have a total part flat/ part pitch roof height of approximately 3.2m which slopes towards neighbouring property no. 34 Avenue Road and ends with an eaves height of approximately 2.1m. Officers also acknowledge that the proposed parapet wall would have a height of approximately 3.5m on the boundary shared with No.38. The depth of the rear extension from the two-storey outrigger would be approximately 3.9m which is an increase when compared to the existing single-storey rear extension that sits at a depth of 2.9m. Whilst officers acknowledge that the extension would fall outside of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD in regard to height and depth, the proposal would still appear subordinate to the house dwelling and would be constructed in matching material to appear as though it was built as one. \r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities.\r\rThe proposed extension sits at a reasonable distance of approximately 1.4m from neighbouring property No. 34 Avenue Road. Whilst officers acknowledge that the proposed development would not pass the 45-degree test on plan concerning neighbouring property No.34, it would pass on elevation due to the proposed pitched roof and the distance from the neighbouring dwelling. As such, it is not considered that there would be any significant loss of daylight to 34.\r\rRegarding neighbouring property no. 38 Avenue Road, officers note that the proposed extension would exceed the depth of the existing rear extension at No.38 by approximately 1m, however, this is considered a small increase and would not cause the failure of the BRE 45-degree test.\r\rTherefore, given the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.\r\rParagraph 194 to 203 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC 1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be described as: An early suburb of Kingston Town Centre comprising houses of various sizes and designs dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855. The area is characterised by houses which are rich in architectural detail and townscape character.\r\rOfficers note Kingston Town CAACs comment regarding the proposed rooflights, as such a condition requiring conservation style rooflights will be imposed in the event of an approval. Additionally, the comment about the preferred UPVC windows is also acknowledged, however, the proposed development would not be readily visible in the streetscene and the proposed material would aid in preserving the conservation area.\r\rAs previously mentioned, the proposed development would be in general keeping with host property and as such would maintain the character of the immediate surrounding area. Given no harm to heritage assets has been identified in this case, it is not necessary to weigh up the proposals against any public benefits. Officers conclude that the proposed development would not result in any harm to the significance of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area.\r\rIn relation to the Archaeological Priority Area, Historic England is not a statutory consultee for applications of this type. Given that the development occupies the same footprint as the pre-existing development on site, it is not considered that there would be any significant adverse impact from an archaeological perspective.\r\rFlood Risk\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 states that current and expected flood risk from all sources across London should be managed in a sustainable and cost-effective way in collaboration with the Environment Agency, the Lead Local Flood Authorities, developers and infrastructure providers.\r\rPolicy DM4 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rOfficer Comment: The Environmental Agency's advice is that all applications within flood zone 2 or 3 including minor development and change of use should submit a flood risk assessment as part of the planning application.\r\rThe application site falls within fluvial Flood Risk Zones 2 and 3A. The site is also identified as being at low risk of surface water flooding. Consequently, the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA must be applied.\r\rWhilst officers acknowledge the submitted Flood Risk Assessment and Flood Risk Form, a planning condition is required to ensure that floor levels within the proposed development will be set no lower than existing levels and that appropriate floodproofing of the proposed development has been incorporated, in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission.\r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted.\r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received, relating to the Loss of light/Sunlight.\r\rThis will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development.\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- Fire Safety.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single-storey rear would have a total depth of approximately 4m and a flat roof height of approximately 3m. Officers acknowledge that the extension would have a depth that would fall outside the guidelines of Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD, however, the height of the extension would be modest and the extension would not be visible from the streetscene. Additionally, single-storey rear extensions are not incongruous in the vicinity of Knightwood Crescent.\r\rTherefore, the proposed extension is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers acknowledge that a concern has been raised regarding Loss of light/Sunlight. Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed rear extension, using the BRE, 45 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. No.52 Knightwood Crescent benefits from a conservatory that sits on the boundary shared with No.54. the proposed extension would only extend past the conservatory at No.52 by approximately 350mm. Additionally, the applicant has demonstrated that the proposed development would not breach the BRE 45 degree, therefore, there would not be a significant loss of daylight as a result of the proposed development to No.52. The representation about outlook is noted, however, the proposal would only have a marginally greater impact on outlook than a timber fence located in the position would have, a normal situation in a garden such as this. Notwithstanind, an outlook for the neighbour towards the end of their garden would remain and as such I see no evidence that an undue sense of enclosure would be created. \r\rThe extension would not significantly affect the nearest ground-floor habitable room of No. 56 Knightwood Crescent as the extension would not exceed the existing garage on site which would be between No.56 and the proposed development. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: whilst officers acknowledge the Fire Safety Statement and the plans which include the provision of a suitably positioned outside space for fire appliances/ an evacuation assembly point and officers see no reason why a development of the type sought could not comply with the rest of the provisions of Policy D12(A), the details of which could be secured through conditions. For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan 2021, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rApplication Site\rThe application site comprises a ground floor flat of a detached building located on a corner plot. The application site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area and is covered by trees subject to Preservation Order. \r\rProposal \rDemolition of porch entrance and erection of single storey front/side extension to enlarge existing ground floor flat and changes to fenestrations\r\rConsultations\rSurbiton Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee - No objection provided that there are conditions that all new materials, windows and doors are to match existing property.\r\rRBK's Tree Officer - objects to the proposal\r\rRepresentations\r38 properties were notified of the proposal. No representations were received.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on the Southborough Conservation Area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the protected trees; and,\r- Fire Safety\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front/side extension would be of a total depth of approximately 7.5m it would not be set back from the front elevation, contrary to Policy Guidance 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. The proposed width would be approximately  3.1m for the main extension and 1.45m for the main entrance extension leading to the application site and first floor flats. \r\rThe proposal would result in loss of the existing front door and portico which are considered to be character features of the application site, that positively contributes to the character and appearance of the host dwelling and therefore the surrounding area. The proposal would offer a large, disproportionate  front extension with a narrow and small main entrance that loses its prominence. \r\rThe proposed extension due to its siting would be fully visible with Corkran Road. Due to its excessive scale, lack of setting back from the front elevation and the proposed front porch and entrance to flats that are very small and narrow is considered not to be in keeping with the character and appearance of the host building and the surrounding area. \r\rFurthermore, it is unclear how the proposal would affect the existing front off street car parking spaces, cycle and waste storage that serve all the flats and the existing landscaping. Given that the proposed main entrance would be very small and concealed, the arrangement of the front garden must be of a quality that is appropriate for a development in a conservation area and that compliments the host building. The front garden must not be solemnly dedicated to car parking and waste and recycling storage. \r\rOfficers note the existing front/side extension to the other side of the building, however its siting and scale is different to the proposal.\r\rIt is noted that the applicant stated only that all the proposed materials would match the existing, full details of the proposed materials would be secured via condition to ensure satisfactory quality and appearance of the proposal on completion. \r\rAs the existing, protected trees along the east boundary make a positive and valuable contribution to the quality of the public realm within Corkran Road and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area, it is considered that the loss of such trees as a result of the development would not be acceptable and would harm the overall character and appearance of the area. \r\rHeritage Assets\rSection 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                  \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  203 of the NPPF 2023 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 205 of NPPF 2023 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.   \r                                           \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site is located within the Southborough Conservation Area.  The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as an area of large detached houses dating from the 1860s - 1930s surrounding Southborough House, an 1808 Grade II listed building by the architect John Nash.\r\rThe application property is not listed or locally listed, but nonetheless contributes positively to the conservation area.\r\rAs stated above Officers consider that the proposed development would result in an adverse impact to the host property and the surrounding area would not relate well to the host property and have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the wider area. It follows that Officers consider that the proposed development would  result in less than substantial harm to the significance of the Southborough Conservation Area. \r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: \rIt is considered that the proposed development due to its siting and modest scale would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHighways Safety\rParagraph 115 of the NPPF, 2023 states that development should only be prevented or refused on transport grounds if there would be an unacceptable impact on highway safety, or where the residual cumulative impacts of development are severe. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 requires development proposals to have regard to local traffic conditions and highway safety and ensure they are not adversely affected. \r\rOfficer Comment: The application site is located within PTL Zone 3 (good) and controlled parking zone. \r\rThe applicant has stated no changes to the existing car parking arrangement (declaring 4 car parking spaces), however it is unclear how the proposal would affect the existing off street car parking spaces, waste/recycling  bin storage that serves the flats located to the front and the existing landscaping. The submitted photographs show 4 cars parked in the front garden.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed, large front/side extension and location of the main entrance to the flats would require new front garden arrangement, however no details have been submitted to address this concern. \r\rFurthermore, it is likely that the new car parking arrangement would not meet the car parking standards and may result in inconsiderate car parking which could impact on the highway safety. \r\rProtected Trees\rPolicy G7 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should ensure that, wherever possible, existing trees of value are retained. If planning permission is granted that necessitates the removal of trees, there should be adequate replacement. Policy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 expects new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders (TPOs) are not adversely affected.\r\rOfficer response: The submitted report confirms that the proposal would have an impact on the root protection area of four mature category B trees and 'a suitable design will be required in advance of the completion of an arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan.'\r\rHowever, no further information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposal could be constructed without resulting in an adverse impact on protected trees.\r\rIt is noted that the RBK's Tree Officer raised objections to the proposal.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rThe applicant has submitted a Fire Statement, which is considered to be acceptable. \r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r",

    "The site comprises semi-detached dwelling within the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, a Strategic Area of Special Character\r\r12 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the development and non-designated heritage assets.\r- Fire Safety\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant previously submitted an application which was approved for the demolition of the existing garage currently converted to habitable use and the erection of part single, part double storey side and rear extension, a rear chimney stack and pot removal and associated internal alteration. This submitted application involves the same works as planning permission ref: 24/00185/HOU, however, the applicant intends to convert the roof into habitable space and add several roof lights as part of the development.\r\rOfficers acknowledge that the proposed first-floor side extension would only be set down from the ridge of the roof of approximately 400mm, however, it would be set back from the front of the dwelling by approximately 1m and would maintain a 1.2m set in from the boundary, falling in-line with the guidelines of the Residential Design SPD, Policy Guidance 36. Whilst the proposed first-floor side/two-storey rear extension would be visible in the streetscene, the proposed roof would resemble the pitched roof form on the host dwelling and the street trees and shrubs on the boundary, helping to mask its appearance. Therefore, on balance, the proposed first-floor side/two-storey rear extension would be considered acceptable in terms of character and appearance.\r\rThe proposed single-storey rear extension would have a total flat roof height of approximately 3m and a depth of approximately 4m, in line with Policy Guidance 33, of the Residential Design SPD. Additionally, the single-storey extension would appear subordinate to the main dwelling and would not be visible in the streetscene.\r\rThe loft conversion would be mainly internal, as the roof lights would be the only aspect visible in the streetscene. The proposed rooflights in this case would be a diminutive feature to the host dwelling and blend in well with the roof form. \r\rOverall, on balance, the proposed development would appear subordinate or proportionate to the existing dwellinghouse, therefore, officers consider that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development and would be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer comment: Officers have assessed the impact on daylighting and sunlighting of the proposed development, using the BRE, 45 & 25 Degree Rule and the Residential Design SPD to ensure minimum impact on neighbouring amenities. In regard to neighbouring property No.51 Robin Hood Lane, there would not be a significant loss of light as there is a reasonable distance from the closest habitable room.\r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rHeritage\rParagraph 203 of the NPPF 2021 states that the effect of an application on the significance of a non-designated heritage asset should be taken into account in determining any application. In weighing applications that directly or indirectly affect non-designated heritage assets, a balanced judgement is required, having regard to the scale of any harm or loss and the significance of the heritage asset.\r\rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer Comment: As noted above the proposal would generally adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, therefore, officers consider that the proposed development would not cause detrimental harm to the character and appearance of Robin Hood Way or the host dwelling. As such, the proposed development would not harm the Kingston Hill/Coombe Hill, Strategic Area of Special Character.\r\rFire Safety\rLondon Plan Policy D12(A) requires all development proposals to achieve the highest standards of fire safety, embedding these at the earliest possible stage.\r\rOfficer comment: The applicant has submitted a Fire Safety Report which suitably addresses the provisions of Policy D12(A). For these reasons, officers conclude that the proposal would not conflict with Policy D12 of the London Plan.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2023), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
