  "decision_conditions": [
    "The proposed development by virtue of the scale, form, location, layout and design of the second floor extension would result in an incongruous form of development that would erode the established character of the area. As such, the proposed development would result in the inappropriate extension which would detract from the character of the building, the terrace on which it is located, and the wider streetscene, and would therefore be contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed flat 1, owing to the single aspect nature of the scheme and the lack of window openings serving the bedroom and upper floor, would result in a poor level of outlook for future occupants. As such the scheme would result in a sub-standard level of living accommodation contrary to policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012\r",
    "The application has not been accompanied by a Legal Agreement restricting parking permits for future occupants. In the absence of such an agreement, it has not been demonstrated that the proposal would not lead to increased parking pressures within a Controlled Parking Zone (CPZ) and area of known parking pressure. The proposal would therefore be contrary to policies CS6 and DM09 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The application has not been accompanied by a Construction Management Plan (CMP) as part of the planning application documents to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the council that the proposal would not lead to highway safety concerns contrary to policies CS6 and DM09 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "The proposal is considered to  be an improvement or other alteration to the outbuilding, therefore it falls within the Class E.",
    "The proposed rear dormer extension, three rooflights to the front roof slope, partial removal of the rear chimney stack and alterations to the soil vent pipe  fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "In response to the provisions of Section 96A Town and Country Planning Act 1990, the application is to be assessed to ascertain as to whether the proposed changes constitutes a non-material amendment to the approved development. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance (2014) states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non- material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree, also taking into account the likely impacts of the amendment. The changes to the height of the rear extension and external finishes on the property are significant changes that are not considered to constitute minor changes.\r",
    "The assessment of this application is been based on measurements taken from the submitted drawings / plans. If it transpires that the drawings / plans submitted are incorrect this would nullify the validity of this decision and you are advised to submit a fresh application with the correct information / drawings.",
    "The fee required for your planning application is Â£ 300.00 (Category E) .  Payment can be made via either our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002, by cheque made payable to Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames or online via the Kingston council website.",
    "Please submit a copy of a site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red and adjoining land owned by applicant in blue, showing at least two road frontages and a North point.\r\r\r",
    "requested confirmation that the works are to rear of property and not front as stated on the drawings.",
    "We cannot accept previously approved plans and elevations that have not yet been built for this application.\r\rWe require current existing/prebuilt plans and elevations and a full work description of all works in entirety that are proposed.\r\rAll drawings must also contain a scale bar."
