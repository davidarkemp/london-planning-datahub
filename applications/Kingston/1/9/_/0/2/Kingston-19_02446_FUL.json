    "The proposed development, by virtue its size and layout would not comply with the required internal floor space as stipulated within Policy Guidance 28 of the Council's Residential Design SPD and The London Plan section 3.5 for Quality Housing as the rooms proposed only meet single room standards and therefore the dwelling cannot be deemed a family sized unit. The proposed development would therefore not accord with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed private amenity space would not provide amenity space, outlook and lighting of a suitable and useable standard to the detriment of future occupants and would therefore not accord with Section 3.5 of the London Plan for Quality Housing, Policy Guidance13 (Private Amenity Space) of the Residential Design SPD and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The proposed development, by virtue of the proposed layout, design and materials would appear as an incongruous addition to the row of terrace and wider locality and as such would appear harmful to the character and appearance of the surrounding area. The proposed development therefore does not comply with Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy.",
    "The Council considers the amendments to be non material and as such, it is recommended that a S96A application for a non-material amendment is approved.",
    "In dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably. Amendments required to make the application acceptable are substantial and would materially change the development proposal.  They would require further consultation to be undertaken prior to determination which could not take place within the statutory determination period specified by the Department of Communities and Local Government.",
