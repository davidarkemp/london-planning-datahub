    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r6 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 2 comments in support have been received. The comments received will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the proposed development on highways and transportation matters. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: While the two storey side extension would not strictly comply with the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of set in from the shared boundary, it would maintain some degree of separation and would be set back from the front elevation so as to preserve the characteristic \"cat slide\" roof of the original dwelling. Overall, it would appear as a proportionate addition to the host property. Further, given that similar extensions are viewed in the immediate vicinity it would not appear an incongruous addition to the Motspur Park streetscene. \r\rWhile the proposed rear extension would have a depth that would exceed the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD (5.4m v 4m), given that it would have an appropriate height and would not be clearly visible from the street, officers consider that it would appear as an appropriate and proportionate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed first floor rear extension would propose a slightly unusual roof form, it would not be clearly visible from the street, would be be set in from the shared boundaries and would appear subordinate to the the host property. As such it is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the separation distance between the proposed development and neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rAs the proposal would provide side facing windows (some of which woud be a substantial size),  it is considered appropriate to implement a condition to ensure that there is no loss of privacy for neighbouring properties. This condition would ensure that the windows are non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels and are obscure glazed. Subject to the satisfaction of such a condition, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would increase the width of the existing dropped kerb from 3m to 4m but maintain the existing front boundary treatment which is of a low height. However, to ensure highway and pedestrian safety in compliance with Policies DM9 and DM10 details regarding visibility splays would be required via condition.  The applicant is also advised that the applicant would be required to seek the approval of the Local Highway Authority with regards to the extension of the dropped kerb (as well as obtaining planning permission) in this case.\r\rLondon Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. While it is not clear from the plans where this would be accommodated, particularly due to the loss of the side access to the rear of the property, officers consider that further details could be ensured via condition to ensure compliance.\r\rIn conclusion and subject to conditions, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey semi detached building, located within the Liverpool Road Conservation Area.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of a single-storey rear extension and a first floor side extension with associated changes to fenestration.\r\rThis application follows a previous planning permission 19/02816/HOU for the erection of a single storey rear extension, new front door and replacement of side door with window. No changes are proposed to the approved ground floor under this application.\r\r\rConsultation\r\r7 properties were notified of the proposal. A total of 5 representations objecting to the proposal were received. It is noted 2 of these were from the same property. \r\rObjections were raised in relation to the following material planning considerations:\r\rIncreased shadows to neighbouring properties\rLoss of privacy\rThe development would set a precedent for first floor development within Liverpool Road\rImpacts to the Conservation Area\rLoss of daylight and sunlight\rLocation of soil pipe to front elevation\r\rAll of the above will be taken into account within the assessment of this application having regard to relevant planning policy and guidance.\r\rOther concerns raised include:\r\rAccess to the property during construction\rPotential damage to service pipes\rGlare from existing security lights\rUse of boundary walls\r\rOther than matters that are controlled by building regulations, the remaining are either managed by party wall agreements or are civil matters to be addressed privately between the relevant parties.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rRear Extension\r\rNo change is proposed to the ground floor single storey rear extension as approved under 19/02816/HOU. \r\rFirst Floor Extension\r\rThe proposed first floor extension would be located to the left hand side of the property (when viewed from the rear), and project 3.3m single from the rear wall of the existing building (3.2m wide) with a pitched roof design 2.48m in height. The extension would be setback from the building line of the ground floor extension below, where it adjoins No.5 Liverpool Road.  \rThe proposed roof pitch of the first floor extension would match the existing. The external materials are satisfactory and would match the existing building. The proposed fenestration alterations to the front elevation are minor and raise no concerns.  No soil pipe to the front elevation is evident on the application drawings, however were officers minded to grant permission its location could be controlled by a condition. \r\rOfficers note that a similar first floor rear extension is evident at No.1 Liverpool Road which forms a pair with the application property. There is no planning history for this extension however and no other development of this nature evident within the application terrace. It is therefore considered that an extension at this level would unduly change the established pattern of built form that exists and characterises both the immediately surrounding, and Conservation area. \r\rFurther, an extension of this type would set a precedent for further development at this level. Whilst not evident from the street, extensions of this nature are highly visible from surrounding properties to the side and rear. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers do not consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rSPD policy guidance states that two storey rear extensions may be acceptable where the dwelling sits on a spacious plot with substantial distances between boundaries and adjacent dwellings. \r\rThe proposed first floor extension would be setback from the boundary shared with No.5 Liverpool Road but the overall separation distance between the two buildings is not significant (6m approximately). The minimal separation distance combined with the 3.3m depth of the extension are considered to result in an undue sense of enclosure to the property at No.5 Liverpool Road. It is also noted that the depth of the extension is that which is usually anticipated or considered acceptable only at ground floor level. \r\rThere are a number of windows located at ground and first floor level to the side elevation of No.5 Liverpool Road facing the application property. Whilst not all of these appear to be habitable rooms, it is difficult to determine the accurate nature of all the rooms to which these windows relate and the combination of the siting, and depth of the extension at first floor level will have some form of impact on shadowing, daylight and sunlight available to these rooms. \r\rHaving regard to the above, officers do not consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rFlood Risk and Drainage\rPolicy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM4 of the Council's Core strategy 2012 require development proposals to accord with the flood risk policies set out in the NPPF.\r\rThe site is located within Flood Zone 1 and has a low risk of flooding. It is not considered the development would exacerbate the current risk posed to the existing built environment.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be approved, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r",
