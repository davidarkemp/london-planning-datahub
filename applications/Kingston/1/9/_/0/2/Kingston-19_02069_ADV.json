    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rApplication is for the reduction and reshape of a small self seeded Ash tree to the rear of the property in a very small garden space where the growth of the tree is causing damage to the property.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.\r",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works would normally be considered excessive and would not be permissable, however, I have been to this site on a a number of occasions over the past 10 years and this line of Lime trees has allways caused me concern due to evident cavities and central decay within them. Unfortunately this is not unusual for the species and in this instance given the stuructural problems of the trees I believe permission should be granted to reduce them significantly and in time potentially allow their removal depending on how they respond to  the pollarding.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",

Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe chief works are to the mature Cedar at the rear of the property. These works are repeat maintenance and are both appropriate and therefore acceptable in nature. The other works are minor and are just to reduce the smaller trees to the sides of the rear property boundary. These too are acceptable.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe Pine is a very large specimen and as seen in the photos is clearly dead and needing removal on health and safety grounds.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are necessary to prevent damage to the building and to ensure safety to the users of the facilities. These are not harmful alterations to the tree, 3m is a very small amount off of the tree given it's size.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise due to COVID19 lockdown. Photos provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are all appropriate general and repeat management to trees being maintained in a back garden setting.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove.\r",
