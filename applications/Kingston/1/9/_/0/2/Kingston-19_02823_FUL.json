One letter has been received regarding the following summarised concerns:\ro\tLoss of daylight/sunlight\ro\tInappropriate scale/design\r\rOfficer response: The raised concerns will be addressed in the assessment.  \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD as the proposed extension to the dormer would not be set back from the side as required. Officers note massing of the dormer (the total enlargement), however it is considered to be acceptable in this case as it would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling and would not change significantly the existing situation in terms of visual impact.\r\rThe proposed rear dormer extension would not be visible from the street. The proposed installation of 2 rooflights to the front is considered acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.  Given the above, it is considered that there would not be significant impact on the existing street scene as a result of the proposal. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the nature of the proposal, its scale and siting it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",

The proposed development would be a disproportionate addition that would be excessive in terms of its bulk, scale and mass, in conflict with Policy Guidance 39 of the Council's Residential Design SPD.\r\rThe proposed installation of 2 rooflights to the front is considered acceptable and in-keeping with the host dwelling and the surrounding area.  \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to the nature of the proposal, its scale and siting it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed extension of the rear dormer, together with the existing dormer would by virtue of its size, siting and design create an incongruous addition to the host property that would be visually intrusive and detract from the character and appearance of the host property and the surrounding area. The proposal would not accord with policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's adopted LDF Core Strategy April 2012.\r",
    "This application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal conflicts with relevant planning policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises \r\rThe London Plan\rRBK Core Strategy 2012\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service.

    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered unacceptable in terms of scale/form/bulk/height/massing/spacing/design in respect of the two storey side extension. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character and appearance of the area as a result of this element of the proposals. It is considered that it would erode the spaciousness between the host property and that of 91 Portland Avenue that exists and would fail to take the opportunity to redress the imbalance of the pair of semi-detached properties created by the hip to gable extension at 95 Portland Avenue. As such the proposal misses the oppurtunity to improve the character and appearance of the pair of semi-detached properties and would as a result further exacerbate the imbalance in the properties. It is considered that it would create an incongruous feature that would be dominant and overbearing and visually intrusive in the streetscene and detract from the character and appearance of the surrounding area. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance/loss of light/loss of privacy.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rOne objection was received on the grounds that the proposed first floor extension would lead to loss of privacy and that the ground floor extension would result in more intensive use of the rear section of the garden, which would in turn result in noise and disturbance. The objection also states that overall, the proposal would be out of character with the existing property and surrounding development. These matters will be considered below.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would project 1.5m beyond the existing rear building line of the property and infill to provide a square layout at ground floor. It would be topped by a parapet roof with a maximum height of approximately 3.2m, which is within the range of heights recommended by the Council's Residential Design SPD. The proposed first floor extension would infill some of the space along the boundary with 8 Cleaveland Road, projecting 1.5m beyond the existing rear wall in this location.\r\rGiven the overall size of the existing property, officers consider the proposed extensions to be moderate in scale. Accordingly, it is concluded that they would appear as subordinate and proportionate additions to the host property. Although it is recognised that the flat roof form of the proposed first floor extension would be at odds with that of the host dwelling, the scale of this element of the proposal and its location would mean that its impact on the character and appearance of the area would be very limited. Meanwhile, the ground floor extension would have the appearance of a typical contemporary extension, the likes of which are seen on properties of varying ages and styles throughout the borough.\r\rHaving regard to the above, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: While it is recognised that the proposed first floor extension would result in a window being inserted closer to the rear boundary than is presently the case, it would still be approximately 17m from the rear boundary and approximately 25m from the nearest opposite window. Given these distances are both well in excess of the Council's guidance on separation distances, officers are satisfied that the proposal would not result in any materially harmful loss of privacy to neighbouring occupiers. \r\rIn terms of overbearing appearance and loss of light, officers recognise that the proposal would involve a first floor extension right up against the boundary with 8 Cleaveland Road. However, the depth of the extension is such that officers do not consider it would appear overbearing and it would also pass the 45 degree test in relation to the nearest adjacent window. At ground floor level, the increase in the length of wall along the boundary with 8 Cleaveland Road (relative to the existing rear projection) would be very limited (1.5m) and officers conclude that it would not appear overbearing or materially reduce the availability of natural light versus the existing relationship.\r\rIn terms of noise and disturbance, officers consider it unlikely that the proposal would result in a material intensification in the use of the rear section of the garden. However, such an intensification would, in any event, involve nothing more than the typical use of the garden of a single family dwelling.\r\rHaving regard to the above, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light, loss of privacy, noise or other disturbance.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan, Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as\ramended), which concerns applications to develop land by removing or varying conditions previously\rattached. In this case, the application is to vary condition 1 (the approved plans) of planning permission\r19/02785/FUL.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rSeventeen neighbouring properties have been notified and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Tree and Landscape Officer - is satisfied witht the information provided and raises no objection to the permission being issued on the condition that they implement the permission in strict adherence to the submitted documents and statements.\r\rThe current application is made pursuant to Section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns applications to develop land by removing or varying conditions previously attached. In this case, the application is to vary condition 4 (Aboricultural Report) of planning permission 20/01110/HOU.\r\rWhile this is, in effect, a fresh application for the entire development, the principle of the development was nonetheless established by the granting of 20/01110/HOU and Section 73(2) of the Act explicitly states that \"on such an application, the local planning authority shall consider only the question of the conditions subject to which permission should be granted\". It would therefore, be unnecessary and unreasonable to revisit every issue which was relevant to the determination of the original application.\r\rHaving regard to the nature of the variations sought under the current application, officers consider that the assessments made under the original application on the following issues remain unaltered:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed changes to the previously approved Arboricultural Report are considered to be acceptable and will not result in harm or loss of trees within a conservation area or under a tree protection order.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused. Accordingly, it is recommended that planning permission be granted.\r",
