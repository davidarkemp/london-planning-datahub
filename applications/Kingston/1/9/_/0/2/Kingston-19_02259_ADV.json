    "No advertisement shall be displayed without the permission of the owner of the site or any other person with an interest in the site entitled to grant permission.\r\rReason: To comply with Regulation 14 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.",
    "No advertisement shall be sited or displayed so as to -\rEndanger persons using any highway, railway, waterway, dock, harbour or aerodrome (civil or military);\rObscure, or hinder the ready interpretation of any traffic sign, railway signal or aid to navigation by water or air; or\rHinder the operation of any device used for the purpose of security or surveillance or for measuring the speed of any vehicle.\r\rReason: To comply with Regulation 14 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.",
    "Where an advertisement is required under the Regulations to be removed, the site shall be left in a condition that does not endanger the public or impair visual amenity.\r\rReason: To comply with Regulation 14 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.",
    "Any structure or hoarding erected or used principally for the purpose of displaying advertisements shall be maintained in a condition that does not endanger the public.\r\rReason: To comply with Regulation 14 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.",
    "Any advertisement displayed, and any site used for the display of advertisements, shall be maintained in a condition that does not impair the visual amenity of the site.\r\rReason: To comply with Regulation 14 of the Town and Country Planning (Control of Advertisements) (England) Regulations 2007.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "Where reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.",
    "The applicant is advised that deliveries to the site should avoid school arrival and pick up times due to existing congestion in the area. Deliveries should also (where possible) avoid waiting on the highway.\r",
    "Any parking that cannot be contained within the site must park considerately and safely, so as not to obstruct sightlines at junctions or site accesses. The applicant should be aware that any such parking will cause unnecessary concern and agitation within the local community.",
    "Service parking and deliveries should not cause any damage to the verges or margins, and no parking is allowed on either.",
    "Please provide a copy of an Ordnance Survey based site location plan scaled 1:1250 with the application site outlined in red, showing at least two road frontages and a North point (the copy you have sent us is incorrectly scaled at 1:500).\r",
    "Please provide a tree survey/landscaping plan",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rAppropriate minor statutory works to ensure clearance for pedestrians and vehicles on highway.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",

    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe tree has entered into terminal decline following the successive removal of diseased or broken limbs, it is now in very poor condition and is becoming dangerous. It should also be noted that it's removal has no impact upon public amenity given that the tree is to the rear of the property.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections.",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rSmall tree not visible to the public and therefore not affecting public amenity or warranting a TPO. The Council decison should be one of no objection.\r\rRecommendation:\rNo objections."
