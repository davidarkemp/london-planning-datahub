    "The proposed two storey side extension by reason of its poor design which includes; the absence of a 0.5m front elevation setback; the absence of a 0.5m roof line set down; and the absence of a 1.0m set in distance from the north-west boundary would appear as a disproportionate and incongruous form of development which would unbalance the character of the application property, therefore the proposal would be at odds with the streetscene of Hamilton Avenue. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed single storey front porch extension by reason of its placement within 0.5m of an existing bay window feature, would represent a form of cramped development which would visually unbalance the front elevation of the application dwelling, therefore the proposal would be at odds with the streetscene of Hamilton Avenue. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The proposed extension and alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A.1, of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015\r\rA.1 Development is not permitted by Class A if -\r\r(e) the enlarged part of the dwellinghouse would extend beyond a wall which -\r     (i) forms the principal elevation of the original dwellinghouse;",
    "Please confirm description of proposed works \"Erection of single storey rear, part first floor rear extension, conversion of garage to a habitable room, installation of new fenestration, chimney and rooflights to front and side.\"",
    "Please provide a revised copy of block plan scaled 1:500 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
