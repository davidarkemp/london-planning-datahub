    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\t\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The proposed roof of the single storey rear extension hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes. \r\t\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Before the beneficial occupation of the development hereby permitted, the west side elevation window, situated on the ground floor shall be constructed and retained in obscure glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof, and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the adjoining premises from overlooking and loss of privacy.\r",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the proposal on the existing car parking facilities.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed front porch would project forward by approx. 1.8m from the existing front elevation (hall) and it would be finished with the mono pitched roof approx. 3.7m high. It would join the side extension and the converted garage. The proposed roof form would relate well to the main roof and the proposed materials would match the host dwelling. It is noticed that the immediate street scene has similar examples of the front porches and side extensions. Therefore the proposed front porch and side extension wold not result in significant impact on the existing street scene. Given the above, the proposed front porch is considerd accaptable, athough it is not strictly following the Policy Guidance 38. \r\rThe proposed side extension (incorporating the converted garage) would project approx. 4.6m beyond the rear elevation and would join the proposed single storey rear extension. It is noted that the single storey rear extension was approved separately under a householder prior notification ref. no. 20/01342/PAEXT, confirming permitted development rights that lay with this property. The flat roof over the side extension would be approx. 2.8m high with no proposed openings to the flank elevation. It is acknowledged that the proposed extensions would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 and 35 of the Council's Residential Design SPD. However, it is considered that the proposed development would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to the host dwelling.\r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest height of the proposed side extension, it is considered that it would not result in an overbearing effect or sense of enclosure in relation to No. 53 Somerset Close. It would also not have a significant impact on the daylight/sunlight or privacy on this adjoining property (due to its siting and no proposed openings to the side). \r\rWith regards to No. 49 Somerset Close, due to the modest scale of the proposed rear extension it would not result in significant loss of daylight. The proposed rear extension would meet BRE guidelines, passing the 45 degree rule in elevation view.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "Policy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Despite the loss of the existing garage, it is considered that the hardstanding to the front of the dwelling remains of an adequate size to accommodate one off street car parking space, therefore the proposal would comply with the Policy DM9 and DM10.\r",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; \r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- Parking\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed rear extension would be greater in depth than is recommended by the Council's Residential Design SPD. However, given the overall scale of the host dwelling, officers do not consider that it would appear disproportionate, especially so given that it would not be readily visible within the street scene. The alterations to the roof of the dwelling would be much more readily appreciable and it is recognised that they would not be in keeping with other properties immediately surrounding the site. However, officers are mindful of the alterations that could be achieved via permitted development, which are reflected in the originally submitted proposal. It is considered that the amended proposal is a significant improvement upon this, given that it would not involve large dormers being constructed on the side roof slopes. The proposed development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: While it is recognised that the proposed rear extension would be greater in depth than is recommended by the Residential Design SPD, it would initially be stepped in from the eastern boundary by approximately 1.5m, increasing to 2.5m for the final 2m. Officers therefore consider that it would not have any material adverse impact upon the amenities of 41 Blakes Lane. Turning to the east, the extension would not project as far beyond the rear building line of 37 Blakes Lane, and so it is again considered that it would have an acceptable impact. The proposed outbuilding would be located at the very end of the garden, would be well separated from the boundaries of the site, and would be low in height. It is therefore considered that this element of the proposal would also have an acceptable impact. Overall, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed ground floor extension would be considerably greater in depth than is recommended by the Council's Residential Design SPD. However, due to the overall scale of the host dwelling, officers consider that it would not represent a visually disproportionate addition. The proposed first floor extension would be in keeping with the box-like form of the host dwelling and would be finished in high quality materials which would complement its distinctly contemporary character. It would be set off from the north-eastern boundary of the site, which would ensure that the characteristic gaps between dwellings in the area would be maintained, and it would sit lower than the height of the main roof, which would ensure a subordinate appearance. Overall, the development is therefore considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed single storey extension would be considerably deeper than is recommended by the Council's Residential Design SPD, its height would be limited, at approximately 3m above ground level. It's impact would also be limited significantly by the fact that the land in the area rises quite steeply from west to east. It is further noted that it is typical for properties on Lord Chancellor's Walk to have rear projections which extend well beyond the rear building lines of their neighbours and it is considered that the proposal would be in keeping with this pattern of development. Accordingly, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012).",
