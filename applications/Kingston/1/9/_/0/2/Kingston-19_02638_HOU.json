    " The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\t\rReason:  As required  by Section 91 of  the Town  and Country Planning  Act  1990,  as amended by Section 51 of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004.\r",
    "The development hereby approved shall be carried out in accordance with the materials specified on the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Section 72 of the Planning (Listed Buildings and Conservation Areas) Act 1990 (as amended) places a duty on local planning authorities to pay special attention to the desirability of preserving or enhancing the character and appearance of conservation areas, when considering development proposals that would affect land or buildings within them.                                                                                                                \rIn determining planning applications which affect heritage assets, Paragraph  192 of the NPPF 2019 requires local planning authorities to take account of: the desirability of sustaining and enhancing the significance of heritage assets and putting them to viable uses consistent with their conservation; the positive contribution that conservation of heritage assets can make to sustainable communities including their economic vitality; and the desirability of new development making a positive contribution to local character and distinctiveness.       \r                                                                                                              \rParagraph 193 of NPPF 2019 states that when considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the assets conservation, irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts of substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance.          \r                                    \rPolicies CS8, DM10 and DM12 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Core Strategy 2012 sets out the Council's commitment to preserve or enhance the existing heritage assets of the Borough through the promotion of high quality design and a focus on heritage-led regeneration. The Council will allow alterations which preserve or enhance the established character and architectural interest of a heritage asset, its fabric or its setting, and will ensure that development proposals affecting historic assets will use high quality materials and design features which incorporate or compliment those of the host building or the immediate area. Features of local importance and special interest will be respected through the consideration of form, scale, layout and detailed designs of a site, area or streetscape.\r\rOfficer comment: The application site is situated within the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of the Fairfield/Knights Park Conservation Area relates to an early suburb of Kingston Town Centre comprising houses of various sizes and designs dating mainly from the 1820s to 1900 around Fairfield, a recreational open space since 1855.\r\rGiven that the proposed development would not be visible form the street, there would be no significant impact on the existing street scene and no harm to the conservation area and it is therefore not necessary to weigh this against the public benefits of the proposals. It is noted that Kingston Town Neighbourhood Conservation Areas Advisory Committee raised no objections to the proposal. \r\rThe proposal due to its siting and scale would not affect any trees located on the application site or adjoining properties. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development accords with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
