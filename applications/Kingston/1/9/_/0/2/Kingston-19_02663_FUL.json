    "The site comprises a terraced dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would measure approx. 4 in depth, would be approx. 3.6 m high (eaves height approx. 2.6m) and would feature mono pitched roof with 2 no. rooflights.  It is acknowledged that the proposed extension would not be strictly in accordance with Policy Guidance 33 of the Council's Residential Design SPD with regards to recommended depths. However, it is considered that the proposed single storey rear extension would appear as a proportionate and subordinate addition in relation to host dwelling. It is noted that No. 41 Sunray Ave already benefits from a similar single storey rear extension and the proposal would be approximately the same depth. \r\rThe proposal would not be visible form the street, therefore there would be no adverse impact on the existing street scene. \r\rAs such, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  Considering the existing extension at no 41 Sunray Ave, the proposal would not result in loss of daylight/sunlight or overbearing effect in relation to this property.\r\rWith regards to No. 45 Sunray Ave, whilst Officers acknowledge that the proposed development would lead to some loss of light in relation to the ground floor window (toilet window), this loss is considered acceptable. Given the modest scale of the proposal and eaves height, the proposed extension would not result in an overbearing effect or loss of privacy (no openings to the side elevations are being proposed).\r\rIt is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
    "The site comprises a linked-detached dwelling situated on the corner plot of Motspur Park and Chillmark Gardens. The current application is a revised scheme of the refused application ref. no. 20/01136/HOU. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r- The impact of the proposal on the highway\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that the adjacent properties on Mostspur Park and Chillmark Gardens benefit from dropped kerb access and hardstandings to the front of their properties, it is considered that the proposal would be in-keeping within the immediate context of the site.\rAs a result, the proposed development would not detract from the character and appearance of the street scene or the surrounding area, in accordance with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: Due to its minor nature, it is considered that the proposals would not cause undue harm to the amenity of the neighbouring occupiers. The proposal would therefore be compliant with Policy DM10 of the Council's adopted LFD Core Strategy.\r\rPolicy DM09 of the Council's LDD Core Strategy (2012) seeks to ensure that new development does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.\r\rOfficer Comment: The applicant submitted Safety Review dated 25.07.2020 addressing issues raised in the previous application ref. no.  20/01136/HOU. It is noted that the Council's Highways Officer raised no objections to the revised scheme. The proposed new dropped kerb would be sited on a befitting location and would be easily visible by the highway users of Motspur Park.\r\rAs such, it is considered that the proposal would not undermine the existing highway safety conditions of Motspur Park and Chillmark Gardens, in accordance with Policy DM09 of the Council's Core Strategy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8, DM09 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).\r",
