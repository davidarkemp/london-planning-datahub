The development hereby permitted shall be carried out strictly in \raccordance with the approved details. \r\rReason: To prevent unnecessary damage occurring to the trees during building  operations, thereby safeguarding the visual amenities of the site in accordance with  Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House \rExtensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "Reasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action.",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.  This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner.  If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.",
    "When undertaking building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  Furthermore, please ensure that all vehicles associated with the construction of the development hereby approved are properly washed and cleaned to prevent the passage of mud and dirt onto the adjoining highway. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation.  For further information and advice, please contact - Environmental Health Department Pollution Section.",

The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r",
