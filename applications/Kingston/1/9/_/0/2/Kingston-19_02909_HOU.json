    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The car parking accommodation shown upon the approved drawings shall be provided with a hard bound dust free surface, adequately drained before the development to which it relates is occupied and thereafter it shall be kept free from obstruction at all times for use by the occupier of the development and shall not thereafter be used for any purposes other than the parking of vehicles for the occupiers of the development and visitors to it.\r\rReason: To ensure the provision of adequate off-street parking accommodation and to avoid the congestion of surrounding roads by parked vehicles in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.",
    "A1 - Loading",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r9 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 neutral representation has been received relating to enhancing biodiversity and the potential to increase swift habitat enhancement.\r\rWhile officers acknowledge the importance of incorporating biodiversity enhancement measurements in planning developments, given that this would be a small-scale householder development, officers consider that it would be unreasonable to apply a condition requiring the applicant to incorporate swift habitat enhancement measures. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note that the single storey and part two storey rear extension element of the proposals would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD. As such the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rWhile the proposed two storey side extension would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of width, it would be set down from the ridge line, set back from the front elevation and would visually maintain the cat slide roof.  As such it is considered to be an appropriate addition to the host property. There would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the siting of the proposed development in relation to the habitable windows of neighbouring properties, It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rWhile openings are proposed to the side elevation at second floor level, to mitigate against any loss of privacy officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition to ensure the windows at first floor level are obscure glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels.\r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposal would involve the demolition of the existing detached garage to the side of the property. However, given that the internal dimensions of the garage do not comply with the requirements set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposal would not result in the loss of on-site parking. In any case the existing hardstanding to the front of the dwelling would be sufficient to accommodate at least 2 spaces for on-site parking. Whilst this level of provision would be in excess of the maximum car parking standards set out in the London Plan, it is considered that this issue would not warrant grounds for refusal given that it is reflective of the existing situation.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013)."
