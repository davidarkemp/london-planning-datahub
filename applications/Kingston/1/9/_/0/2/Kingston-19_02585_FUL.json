    "By virtue of its siting, design and width, the proposed dwelling would appear cramped and at odds to  its immediate locality and would not respect the rhythm and spacing of the surrounding built form. The proposal would therefore harm the character and appearance of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM10 of the adopted  Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's adopted Residential  Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed single, part three storey rear extension would be excessively large and fail to appear as a subservient addition. Consequently, this element of the proposal would cause unacceptable harm to the character and appearance of the host dwelling at No.202 Kingshill Avenue and the surrounding area. This would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy DM10 of the adopted  Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's adopted Residential  Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "By virtue of its siting, size and scale, the proposed development would cause harm upon the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers at number 202 Kingshill Avenue and numbers 7 to 12 Primrose Court, in terms of loss of outlook, overbearing impact and sense of enclosure. This would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (2016), Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012) and the Council's adopted Residential Design Supplementary Planning Document (2013).\r",
    "The applicant has failed to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the local planning authority that the proposed parking arrangements as shown on the submitted drawings would not prejudice highway safety. The proposal would therefore be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (2016)  and Policies DM9 and  DM 10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "When undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays. You are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r",
    "Section 59 of the Highways Act permits the Highway Authority to charge developers for damage caused by excessive weight and movements of vehicles to and from a site. The Highway Authority will pass on the cost of any excess repairs compared to normal maintenance costs to the applicant/organisation responsible for the damage. \r",
    "The developer is reminded that it is an offence to allow materials to be carried from the site and deposited on or damage the highway from uncleaned wheels or badly loaded vehicles. The Highway Authority will seek, wherever possible, to recover any expenses incurred in clearing, cleaning or repairing highway surfaces and prosecute persistent offenders. (Highways Act 1980 Sections 131, 148, 149).\r\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist. This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor. \r",
    "Our apologies for the delay in dealing with your application, but further assistance is required in terms of your stating that the basement is now omitted however the application form recently submitted still makes reference to a basement. Please clarify and amend accordingly",
    "Please be advised that we do not accept Land Registry Site Location Plans and we would ask that you provide Ordinance Survey Plans to scale 1:1250 with the application site highlighted in red and with a North Point showing",
    "Please ensure all drawings provide a scale bar at the appropriate scale",
    "Please be advised that the submitted site location plan and block plan, both need to have the red line outlined around the application site and not just the building"
