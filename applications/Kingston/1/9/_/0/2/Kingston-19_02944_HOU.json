    "The development hereby permitted shall be commenced within 3 years from the date of this decision.\r\rReason: In order to comply with Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act, 1990.  (As amended)\r",
    "Notwithstanding the provisions of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (or any Order revoking or re-enacting this Order) no windows or other openings (other than those hereby approved) shall be formed in northern and southern flank walls or roof slopes of the building hereby approved without the prior written consent of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development shall be completed in accordance with the following details which shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the Local Planning Authority, prior to above ground works:\r\r(a)  materials for all external finishes of the dormer roof extension and new front boundary (including their manufacturer(s) specification, dimensions, colour and texture). \r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "In accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal",

    "The site comprises a mid terrace dwelling.\r\rFive neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed extension would project approximately 3.9 metres beyond the rear elevation of adjoining property, No. 64 Douglas Road and 3 metres beyond the rear elevation of adjoining property, No. 60 Douglas Road and feature a flat roof.  It would span the full plot width of the property and abut both shared boundaries. Given the proposed depth of the extension, its lack of separation distance from the shared boundaries and the position of principal neighbouring habitable room window at ground floor level, it is considered that the proposed development would be unneighbourly and would have an unacceptable adverse impact upon the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.  The proposed udevelopment would fail BRE Guidance in relation to the 45 degree rule and result in an unacceptable adverse impact in terms of loss of light, would create an undue sense of enclosure and would result in a loss of outlook to both Nos. 60 and 64 Douglas Road. The proposal is therefore considered to be contrary to Policy 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2016) Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
