    "The proposed resultant development, by reason of its excessive residential density, scale, and size would result in an over-intensive form of development. The proposed development would be cramped in appearance and represent a stark contrast to its surrounding suburban context, in terms of siting, height and design. The proposal would therefore cause harm to the character and appearance of the area, contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policies 3.4, 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan (as amended in 2016), Policies CS8, CS10 and DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 24 and 27 of the Council's  Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "The proposed gates to the front of the site would be out of character with the neighbouring residential properties on the surrounding streetscape on Lime Grove. Moreover, the proposed gates would effectively create a gated community which would  prevent social permeability contrary to the aims of sustainable development set out in the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London (as amended in 2016), Policy CS14 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The proposal would harm the living conditions of neighbouring occupiers at number 13 Lime Grove and numbers 17 and 17A Lime Grove, in terms of outlook, privacy, overlooking and overbearing impact. Also, it has not been demonstrated that the proposed Parklift system would not result in unacceptable noise and disturbance for neighbouring occupiers. Accordingly, the proposal would be contrary to paragraph 170 of the NPPF,  Policies 7.6  and  7.15 of the London Plan, and Policy DM10 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "The cumulative impact of the failure to the limited outdoor space, poor outlook and lack of privacy is such that the proposed development would not provide a satisfactory standard of accommodation for future residents. Consequently, the proposal would be contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 3.5 of the London Plan (as amended in 2016), Policies DM10 and part A of DM13 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012), and Policy Guidance 13 and 14 Council's Residential Design Guide Supplementary Planning Document (2013).",
    "Insufficient information has been provided to demonstrate that the proposal would not result in unacceptable parking stress and lead to additional congestion as drives seek a parking space, or park illegally. The proposed parking arrangements, and absence of a unilateral agreement to secure the car club and city car schemes, would have a harmful effect on highway safety in the area. The proposal would fail to comply with Paragraph 109 of the National Planning Policy Framework (2019),  Policy 6.13 of the London Plan (as amended in 2016) and Policies DM9 and DM10 of the Core Strategy (2013).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local planning authority that the proposal could  adequately accommodate refuse and recycling facilities that are of a sufficient size and location. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policy CS 9 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012), Policy Guidance 22  and Appendix 2 of the Council's Residential Design SPD (2013).",
    "The proposal fails to adequately assess the feasibility of preferred sustainable drainage measures as set out in the London Plan Drainage Hierarchy. In this respect the proposal fails to accord with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 5.13 of the London Plan (as amended in 2016), and Policy DM 4 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "In the absence of a legal agreement to secure the necessary financial contributions to off-set the shortfall in carbon dioxide reductions, the proposal would fail to meet the zero carbon requirement contrary to the National Planning Policy Framework (2019), Policy 5.2 of the London Plan (as amended in 2016) and Policies CS1 and DM1 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "It has not been demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local planning authority that the proposal is unable to provide a provision of affordable housing. The inputs calculations relied upon with the  Viability Assessment is also questioned. It is therefore considered that the absence of affordable housing provision has not been adequately justified. As such, the proposal would conflict with the National Planning Policy Framework (2019) and  Policy DM15 of the adopted Core Strategy (2012).",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist. This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor. \r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above are agreed and that Condition 3 (Facing Materials) is hereby fully discharged.",
    "B.2 (a) states that the materials used in any exterior work shall be of a similar appearance to those used in the construction of the exterior of the existing dwellinghouse.\r\rThe face and sides of a dormer window should be finished using materials that give a similar visual appearance to the existing house, i.e. the facing materials used for the dormer should appear to be of similar design, colour and texture to the materials used in the main roof of the house when viewed from ground level. Window frames should also be similar to those in the existing house in terms of their colour and overall design. \r\rThe proposed use of cladding would not match the existing roof tiles.\r",
    "The proposed extension and alterations fall within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes A, B, C and G of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "The proposed  alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class A of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 \r\rPermitted development rights allow householders to improve and extend their homes without the need to apply for planning permission where that would be out of proportion with the impact of works carried out.\r\rFlats or houses that have been converted to flats are not covered under the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 and must apply for planning permission.",
    "The footway and carriageway on the A243 Leatherhead Road must not be blocked during the development works. Temporary obstructions during the development works must be kept to a minimum and should not encroach on the clear space needed to provide safe passage for pedestrians or obstruct the flow of traffic on the A243 Leatherhead Road.",
    "All vehicles associated with the development must only park/ stop at permitted locations and within the time periods permitted by existing on-street restrictions.",
    "No skips or construction materials shall be kept on the footway or carriageway on the TLRN at any time.

    "Please provide a copy of proposed side (South) elevations at a recognised scale of 1:50 or 1:100, providing a scale bar, showing all elevations not just part and indicating all key dimensions for the proposed work.",
    "Please provide validation requirement 3d - Street Scene",
    "Please note that if you wish to discharge/approve planning conditions for 2 separate applications (previously approved) these can not be submitted on one application form and will require to be submitted under separate cover",
    "Please note that your recently submitted revised application form still refers to a basement as part of the proposal. Kindly remove reference to this, and once received, in it's revised form, we will validate your application",
    "Kindly note from our previous note to you, that the submitted plans, which were assessed by the Team Leader, are not sufficient for this application to be determined in its current form, and therefore revised plans, to scale 1:50 or 1:100, which are clearly drawn wll be required. The differences in measurements are not accurate from previous submissions, and there are irregularities when trying to scale.\r\rWe would require professionally drawn plans, to scale, in order for this application to be considered",
