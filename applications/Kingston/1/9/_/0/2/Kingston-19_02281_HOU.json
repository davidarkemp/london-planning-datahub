    "Development  shall  be  carried  out  in  accordance  with  the  materials  specified  on  the approved plans and on the application form unless otherwise agreed in writing by the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To ensure a satisfactory appearance on completion of the development in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The development hereby permitted shall begin before the expiration of three years from the date of this permission.\r\rReason: This is required by Section 91 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990.",
    "The roof of the outbuilding hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "The outbuilding hereby permitted shall only be used as accommodation incidental to the main residential use at The Coach House, Nos.28-30 Langley Avenue and shall not be used as a separate unit of accommodation.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Prior to above ground works manufacturers details of the living roof of the outbuilding and its maintenance as well details of the proposed plant species including size, maturity and layout shall have been submitted to and approved in writing by the local planning authority.  The approved works shall be carried out in the first planting season following the completion of the development and the living roof shall be permanently retained for that purpose.  Any plants which within a period of five years from the completion of the development die, are removed, or become seriously damaged or diseased shall be replaced in the next planting season with others of similar size and species.\r\rReason: To ensure that these works are properly implemented and maintained and in the interest of visual amenity in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The application is made pursuant to Section 96A of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (as amended), which concerns non-material amendments to planning permission. \r\rUnder Section 96A, a change may be made to any planning permission, including through the imposition of new conditions or the removal/alteration of existing conditions, if the local planning authority is satisfied that the change is not material. In deciding whether a change is material, a local planning authority must have regard to the effect of the change, together with any previous changes made under this section, on the planning permission as originally granted. \r\rThe National Planning Practice Guidance states that there is no statutory definition of 'non-material'. This is because it will be dependent on the context of the overall scheme - an amendment that is non-material in one context may be material in another. The judgement on 'materially' in any particular case is one of fact and degree.\r\rThe application seeks to amend the proposed windows and reduce the size of the front porch. Officers are satisfied that the alterations  would not give rise to any material issues in terms of character and appearance of the area or on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. Accordingly, the changes are considered to be non-material.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling located on the western side of Leatherhead Road.\r\r5x neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received.\r\rRBK Neighbourhood Highways Engineers - Object - \rObjection made on highway safety grounds and the following comments have been made:-\r\"The proposal is for a proposed crossover and associated hardstanding to the front area of the existing residential house at No. 380 Leatherhead Road, Chessington KT9 2NN. In relation to Kingston Upon Thames Policy and Design Guidance, the planning proposal does notadhere to the minimum design standards for new vehicle crossovers noting:\re) Proximity to Bus Stops and Pedestrian Crossings A proposed vehicle crossover or extension must not be within 10m of any formal pedestrian crossing or refuge (including zebra crossings and signalised crossings such as pelicans and toucans), bus stop or a bus cage.\rg) Grass Verges If the proposed crossover or extension would require removal of a grass verge greater than 2.0m deep (1.6m deep in Conservation Areas and Local Areas of Special Character),measured at right angles to the highway, the application will be refused.\r\rThe proposed crossover onto Leatherhead Road is situated within 10m of the 465 bus stop and bus cage, although this distance is not shown on the supporting plans. It also appears that 2m of grass verge may be required to be removed to facilitate the vehicle crossover.\r\rIt is noted that a vehicle crossover is provided at 376 Leatherhead Road, which is also situated within the 10m clearance requirement, however, it is not clear if they driveway was present before the bus stop and cage was installed.\rBased on current planning policy and the Council's 2019 Crossover Policy Highways object to this application. Should planning approval be forthcoming a separate Crossover Application will need to be submitted to the Local Highway Authority.\"\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- Highway Safety;\r- The extent of surface coverage of the proposed vehicular crossover; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rAs stated above the proposed crossover onto Leatherhead Road would be situated within 10 metres of a No. 465 bus stop and bus cage and this distance is not shown on the supporting plans. It is considered that the applicant has not demonstrated that the proposal would not have an unacceptable impact on highway safety. The proposal is therefore contrary to paragraph 111 of the NPPF 2021, policy T4 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions. It is also stated in Policy DM10 of the Kingston Core Strategy (2012) that development proposals will be required to incorporate principles of good design. The most essential elements identified as contributing to the character and local distinctiveness of a street or area which should be respected, maintained or enhanced. The Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respect the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe hard surface coverage of the proposed vehicular crossover, would appear to require more than 2 metres of grass verge to be removed, to facilitate the vehicle crossover. This coverage would be excessive and is considered to have an unacceptable adverse impact on the quality of the public realm and landscape within Leatherhead Road and the character and appearance of the street and the wider area, in conflict with Policy D3 of the London Plan 2021, Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames and the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Crossover Policy 2020.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r4 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:The proposed single storey rear extension would have a depth and height that is within the parameters set out in the Residential Design Guide, and as such would appear a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host property. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the modest scale of the proposed development, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",
