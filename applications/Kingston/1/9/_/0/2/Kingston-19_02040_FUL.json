    "--- Officer Report ---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThe Development Plan comprises:\r\rThe London Plan 2021;\rRBK Core Strategy 2012;\rKingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008; and,\rThe South London Waste Plan 2012.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached residential dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe proposal relates to the erection of a single storey rear extension.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS) (2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r--- Informatives ---\r\rPositive and Proactive\rIn dealing with the application the Council has implemented the requirement in the National Planning Policy Framework to work with the applicant in a positive and proactive way.  We have made available detailed advice in the form or our statutory policies in the Core Strategy, Supplementary Planning Documents, Planning Briefs and other informal written guidance, as well as offering a full pre-application advice service, in order to ensure that the applicant has been given every opportunity to submit an application which is likely to be considered favourably.\r\rBuilding Regulations\rYour attention is drawn to the need to comply with the relevant provisions of the Building Regulations, the Building Acts and other related legislation.  These cover such works as  - the demolition of existing buildings, the erection of a new building or structure, the extension or alteration to a building, change of use of buildings, installation of services, underpinning works, and fire safety/means of escape works.  Notice of intention to demolish existing buildings must be given to the Council's Building Control Service at least 6 weeks before work starts.  A completed application form together with detailed plans must be submitted for approval before any building work is commenced.\r\rParty Wall Act\rThe Party Wall Act 1996 requires a building owner to notify, and obtain formal agreement from, any adjoining owner, where the building owner proposes to:\r\r- carry out work to an existing party wall;\r- build on the boundary with a neighbouring property;\r- in some circumstances, carry out groundworks within 6 metres of an adjoining building.\r\rNotification and agreements under this Act are the responsibility of the building owner and are quite separate from Building Regulations, or Planning Controls.  The Building Control Service will assume that an applicant has obtained any necessary agreements with the adjoining owner, and nothing said or implied by the Council should be taken as removing the necessity for the building owner to comply fully with the Party Wall Act. Further information and advice is to be found in \"The Party Walls etc. Act 1996 - Explanatory Booklet\".\r\rProperty Boundaries\rYour attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights, and that if your proposal involves construction on or near the site boundary then you should take appropriate steps to ensure that you have correctly identified the position of the boundary, that you do not build over it, and that any works which affect a neighbours property in any way have the benefit of the appropriate agreement from that landowner. Failure to undertake the above steps may leave you liable to legal action by neighbouring landowners. If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r\rConsistency of Plans\rReasonable efforts have been made to check that the plans submitted for the purposes of this planning application are consistent from one to the next, and that the development hereby approved can be implemented in accordance with all of the plans submitted. Should it transpire that this is not possible and that your plans are flawed, please be clear that it may be impossible to implement this permission, and that any development undertaken which relies on this permission may be unauthorised and subject to enforcement action if expedient.\r\rConstruction Site Noise\rWhen undertaking demolition and/or noisy building work, please be considerate to your neighbours and do not undertake work before 8am or after 6pm Monday to Friday, before 8am or after 1pm on a Saturday or at any time on Sundays or Bank Holidays.  \r\rYou are advised that the Council does have formal powers to control noise and nuisance under The Control of Pollution Act 1974, the Clean Air Acts and other relevant legislation, and that any works undertaken which impact unreasonably upon the surrounding area may be subject to action by the Council's Environmental Health Department.\r\rDefinition of Approved in Writing\rWhere reference is made within the decision notice to a condition applying 'unless otherwise agreed in writing with the local planning authority', please be aware that only a formal application under section 73 or 96a of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (As Amended) is acceptable as a method of said written agreement.\r\rGround Level / Base Level\rUnless clearly specified otherwise, the base of the development shown on the approved plans is taken to be external ground level, and not a Damp Proof Course or Internal Finished Floor Level. The external ground level is expected to remain consistent before and after construction of the approved development unless specified otherwise on the approved plans.",
    "---OFFICER REPORT---\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\rThe site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rThe application seeks the erection of a part single, part two storey rear extension, the erection of railings to the front boundary, the insertion of replacement windows, and a change to the location of the front door.\r\rConsultation\r21 properties were notified of the proposal. 2 objections were received. The material issues raised are summarised as follows:\r\r- Overbearing appearance\r- Loss of light\r- Loss of privacy\r- Harm to the character and appearance of the area\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r\r- The planning history;\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area;\r- The impact of the development on heritage assets; and\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rPlanning History\rThe planning history is a material consideration. Planning permission was recently granted under application reference 21/01019/HOU for a development which is identical to the current proposal except for the fact that in that case, the single storey rear element would measure 4m in depth, rather than the currently proposed 5m.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe single storey element of the proposed rear extension would extend across the entirety of the rear elevation to a depth of 5m, rising to a maximum height of 3.36m above ground level. The two storey element of the proposed rear extension would also extend across the entirety of the rear elevation but would measure 1.15m in depth. Its roof would effectively extend the existing rear roof slope, albeit with a slightly shallower pitch. \r\rOfficers note that the Council's Residential Design SPD states that single storey extensions should generally not exceed 3m to 3.5m in depth and those with parapet roofs should not exceed 3.3m in height. The proposed rear extension would exceed these dimensions and would appear even taller when viewed from 26A Clifton Road, since the land falls by approximately 300mm towards this property. The Residential Design SPD suggests that in these circumstances, the depth of a rear extension should be reduced.\r\rIn considering the approved scheme, officers were mindful of the fact that the Residential Design SPD also states that if a neighbouring property has a different rear building line, then the depth of the extension could be increased. 26A Clifton Road does indeed have a different rear building line and in that case, the proposed single storey element would project only approximately 3m beyond it.\r\rHowever, in the current case, the proposed extension would project beyond the rear building line of 26A Clifton Road by a little over 4m. In light of this, officers consider that the proposed single storey extension would appear somewhat disproportionate when viewed next to 26A Clifton Road but not to the extent that it would warrant refusal of the application. This view is strengthened by the fact that the extension would be set off the shared boundary by approximately 1m and would not be readily visible from public vantage points. \r\rTurning to the other adjoining neighbour, 30 Clifton Road, the proposed single storey element would be set hard up against the shared boundary. However, it would only project beyond the rear building line of this property by approximately 1.2m.\r\rAt first floor level, the proposed extension would project beyond the rear building line of 26A Clifton Road by approximately 1.6m. However, it would again benefit from approximately 1m of separation from the shared boundary. To the other side, the extension would match the rear building line of 30 Clifton Road.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers do not consider that the proposed extensions would appear cramped or otherwise represent an overdevelopment of the site. They would appear somewhat disproportionate when viewed next to 26A Clifton Road but officers do not consider that this would result in material harm to the character and appearance of the area. \r\rThe alterations to the front of the property would see the existing aluminium sash windows replaced by metal-clad timber casements. The front door would be brought forward, resulting in the loss of the front porch, although the distinctive brick arch would be retained. A set of black painted wrought iron railings and gates, with brick piers, would be erected along the front boundary of the site.\r\rAlthough the loss of the sash windows would be somewhat regrettable, officers recognise the prevalence of casement windows in the area, including many lower quality uPVC designs. Given this, officers consider that the change would have a very limited impact on the overall character and appearance of the area. Likewise, officers consider that the relocation of the front door would have a very limited impact, especially since the brick arch would be retained.\r\rIt is recognised that timber fences and low brick walls are more typical means of enclosure for the area. However, there are some limited examples of metal railings and these do not detract from the character or appearance of the area. As such, officers consider that the railings and gates currently proposed would have an acceptable impact.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the overall impact of the proposed development on the character and appearance of the area would be acceptable.\r\rHeritage\rParagraphs 193 to 202 of the NPPF set out the method for assessing the impact of development proposals on heritage assets. Policy HC1 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM12 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 echo these requirements.\r\rWhen considering the impact of a proposed development on the significance of a designated heritage asset, great weight should be given to the asset's conservation (and the more important the asset, the greater the weight should be). This is irrespective of whether any potential harm amounts to substantial harm, total loss or less than substantial harm to its significance. \r\rThe site is located just outside of the boundary of the Park Road Conservation Area. The special architectural and historic interest of this area can be summarised as an area of fine Victorian houses and local shops dating from 1890 -1900.\r\rGiven that the application property is recognisably modern, and noting that the impact of the development on the character and appearance would be acceptable, officers do not consider that the proposed development would result in any harm to the significance of the conservation area. It is therefore not necessary to weigh up the public benefits of the proposal.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe spatial relationship between the proposed extensions and neighbouring properties has been discussed at length above and in the interests of brevity will not be fully reiterated. The most important point to note is that unlike the already approved scheme, the currently proposed single storey element would project beyond the rear building line of 26A Clifton Road by a little over 4m. Officers consider that this depth, together with the height of the structure and the difference in land levels between the sites would cause the proposed development to appear overbearing when viewed from 26A Clifton Road. Officers reach this conclusion despite the 1m separation between the structure and the boundary.\r\rWith regard to natural light, the proposed extensions would pass the 45 degree test as set out in the Residential Design SPD. This indicates that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on daylight. Land levels are again relevant in respect of 26A Clifton Road but the development would nonetheless pass the test.\r\rWith regard to privacy, officers note that the proposal would not involve the insertion of any new side facing windows at first floor level or above. However, the existing windows would be replaced and would therefore be necessary to impose a condition requiring obscure glazing to prevent unacceptable loss of privacy. New side facing windows would be inserted at ground floor level and although it is not normally necessary to impose conditions on these, in light of the differing land levels between the site and 26A Clifton Road, a similar obscure glazing condition would be necessary here.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would appear overbearing when viewed from 26A Clifton Road, resulting in material harm to the living conditions for the occupants of this property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r\rConclusion\rThe proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and would not have any impact on the significance of heritage assets.\r\rHowever, the proposed development, by reason of its depth, height and siting, would appear overbearing when viewed from 26A Clifton Road, resulting in material harm to the living conditions for the occupants of this property. The proposal is therefore contrary to policy D3 of the London Plan 2021 and policy DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012. Officers attach significant weight to this harm.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be contrary to the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be granted, officers conclude that planning permission should be refused.\r\rDetails of the Application Submission\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 details of the application submission were available on the Council's website during the assessment of the application.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r---END OF OFFICER REPORT---",
