    "The erection of hip to gable and rear dormer roof extensions with 1 x rooflights to front roofslope falls within the parameters of permitted development as set out under Schedule 2, Part 1, Classes B and C of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Energy Strategy\rThe proposed energy strategy follows the same principles of the existing strategy. Temporary boilers providing\rheat to Phase 1 will be provided. These and the ancillary equipment to support them will be contained within a\rtemporary boiler plant room adjacent to Phase 1 instead of within the building footprint.\rPhase 2 will contain the site wide energy centre, as before, and this will connect into Phase 1 once this is built,\rallowing the temporary plant to be removed. The thermal performance of Phase 1 has also improved, as\rdemonstrated in the Part L1A and L2A reports appended to this note, with CO2 reductions of 10% and 2%\rrespectively.\rA detailed application for Phase 2 will be made in the future. This will include a detailed Energy Strategy\rapplying the new GLA policy of decarbonisation. The new Energy Centre will include heat pumps to provide a\rlarge proportion of the heat to the site and utilise low temperature heat network principles. Combined with the\rnew fuel carbon factors this will greatly increase the CO2 reduction of the development, including Phase 1,\ronce this is connected. There will also be an improvement to the local air quality compared to the approved\rscheme.\rConfirmation of the CO2 reductions and overall performance will be confirmed in the Phase 2 Energy Strategy.\r\rConclusion\rAs can be demonstrated the principles of the original energy strategy will be followed. The changes to the\rthermal performance within Phase 1 and the proposed updated energy strategy for Phase 2 will result in large\rCO2 reductions and increased air quality. It will also mean the entire site is compliant with the latest GLA\rpolicy.\r\rEnvironmental Health: Following clarification don't object to temporary energy centre on air quality grounds.\r\rResidential Amenity:\rNo residential amenity concerns are raised by this proposal.\r\rDesign\r\rThe temporary building will be located to the west of the proposed housing. It will be surrounded by fencing.\r\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design for a temporary period. It is considered that there would be no adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development for a temporary period. This would give the benefit of allowing the detailed phase of the housing to be provided.",
