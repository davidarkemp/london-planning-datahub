    "The details submitted for the Condition 24A (Contaminated Land Assessment) of planning permission 15/13013/FUL by the applicant are considered satisfactory and the Condition 24A is hereby fully discharged.",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL) and Kingston CIL (KCIL).  The MCIL liability would be £35psm and KCIL liability £85psm.\rPayment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner.  Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount.   \rWhen you have discharged all pre-commencement conditions the Council will issue a Liability Notice to the owner setting out the MCIL calculation.  Accompanying the Liability Notice will be a  blank Commencement Notice and if necessary a blank Assumption of Liability form, both of which need to be completed and returned to the Council prior to development commencing.  A failure to do so will incur a surcharge.  \rShould you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk <mailto:mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk> or phone 0208 547 5002.\r",
    "Please provide a copy of block plan scaled 1:500/site plan scaled 1:200 showing the proposed works (hatched or shaded) in relation to the existing dwelling, site boundaries and any outbuildings on site.  The block plan should also show adjoining properties to the side and rear and those opposite in full outline."
