    "The proposed extension and alterations are not considered to fall within the parameters of  permitted development as set out under schedule 2, Part 1, Class B of the Town and County Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of and and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The Residential Design SPD requires that two storey side extensions should appear as subordinate and proportionate additions to the host property. To that end, they should be set down from the main ridge of the dwelling by at least 500mm. In the case of properties with a cat-slide roof form, they should also be set back from the front wall of the property by at least 1m in order to retain this feature.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would neither be set down from the main ridge nor set back from the front wall, instead appearing as a fully integrated extension, which would result in the loss of the characteristic cat-slide roof form. It would result in the application property having a wholly different appearance to its adjoining semi-detached neighbour and would significantly alter the massing of the building, such that it would appear lopsided and unbalanced.\r\rOfficers note that many of the properties on the road have been extended to varying degrees but many of these retain (even if it is only as a somewhat symbolic gesture) their original cat-slide roofs. The pair of semi-detached properties opposite the site do not appear to have been altered whatsoever.\r\rHaving regard to these considerations, officers consider that the proposed two storey extension would dominate and unbalance the pair of semi-detached properties of which the application property forms a part and that the development is unacceptable in terms of scale and siting. It is considered that there would be an unacceptable adverse impact on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposals.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment:  It is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposal would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area and is therefore contrary to Policies 7.4 and 7.6 of the London Plan 2016 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.",
