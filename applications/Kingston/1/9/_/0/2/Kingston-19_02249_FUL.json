Aside from essential fixings, the screen(s) shall be constructed entirely of, and retained in, obscured-glazing to a minimum of level 3 on the standard scale. Any film used to achieve the requisite obscurity level shall be non-perishable and tamper-proof and must be replaced in the event that it ceases to result in obscurity to level 3. \r         \rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the occupiers of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",

    "The roof of the proposed development hereby permitted shall not be converted or used as a balcony or a sitting out area, and no access shall be gained except for maintenance purposes.\r\rReason: To protect the amenities and privacy of the adjoining residential properties in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "No fans, louvres, ducts or other external plant other than those shown on the drawings hereby approved shall be installed without the prior written approval of the Local Planning Authority.\r\rReason: To safeguard the amenities of the occupiers of the neighbouring properties and the visual amenities of the area in accordance with Policy DM10 (Design Requirements for New Developments including House Extensions) of the LDF Core Strategy Adopted April 2012.\r",
    "Site\rThe application site is a two-storey end-terrace dwellinghouse located on Cranborne Avenue. The site is not subject to any particular designations or environmental constraints.\r\rConsultations\rSix neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations were received.\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development;\rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\rThe impact of the development on highways. \r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Comments: The application proposes the construction of a wraparound single storey extension at the front, side and rear of the property. The proposed rear extension extends 4 metres in depth beyond the existing rear wall of the dwellinghouse, above the recommended 3-3.5 metres as stated in the Residential Design SPD 2013. However, it would not have an unacceptable impact on the dwellinghouse in terms of character and appearance, as it appears subordinate and proportionate to the dwellinghouse. Similarly, the proposed side extension is largely acceptable in relation to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD. Officers note however the proposed front extension, to facilitate a porch. The porch would not reflect the character of the main house, and appears like an obvious addition, largely due to the proposed repositioning of the entranceway to the dwellinghouse, through the creation of the porch and its connection to the side extension. Furthermore, the proposed roof of the porch does not reflect the roof style of the original dwellinghouse, and does not respect the symmetry of the adjoining property. As such, the proposed front extension would have an unacceptable impact on the character and appearance of the dwellinghouse and streetscene. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider in relation to amenity is No. 46 Cranborne Avenue. This neighbouring property has an existing single storey rear extension. As such it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy.\r\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety. Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficers Comments: Whilst the application proposes the construction of a single storey extension at the front of the dwellinghouse, it would not impact the current parking provision. London Plan policy T5 requires all development to include provision for cycle parking. Given that the proposal would include the loss of access to the rear garden, and that no details have been given to indicate that there would be secure onsite cycle storage, Officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition for the applicant to provide details of secure cycle storage prior to the occupation of the proposed development, if the application was approved.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be contradictory with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

The proposed rear extension extends 4 metres in depth beyond the existing rear wall of the dwellinghouse, above the recommended 3-3.5 metres as stated in the Residential Design SPD. However, it would not have an unacceptable impact on the dwellinghouse in terms of character and appearance, as it appears subordinate and proportionate to the dwellinghouse. Similarly, the proposed side extension is largely acceptable in relation to the requirements of the Residential Design SPD. Officers note however the proposed front extension, to facilitate a porch. The porch does not reflect the character of the main house, and appears like an obvious addition. Largely due to the proposed reposition of the entranceway to the dwellinghouse, through the creation of the porch and its connection to the side extension. Furthermore, the proposed roof of the porch does not reflect the roof style of the original dwellinghouse, and does not respect the symmetry of the adjoining property. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficers Comments: The principal property to consider in relation to amenity is 46 Cranborne Avenue.

    "The assessment has been based on the original layout of the house which shows an original outrigger. The existing rear toilet extension is not part of the original footprint. The proposed extension would therefore extend beyond the side elevation of the original footprint and would have a width greater than half the width of the original dwellinghouse, in conflict with Paragraph A.1 (j) (iii) & (ja) of the Town and Country Planning (General Permitted Development) (England) Order 2015 (as amended).",
    "Application Site\rThe site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\rProposal\rErection of single storey side and rear extensions, including new front bay window and alterations to fenestration\r\rConsultation\rNine neighbouring properties have been notified and one objection has been received raising the following concerns:\r- Excessive height or bulk of buildings;\r- Inappropriate design/layout; and,\r- Noise.\r\rAssessment\rThe key areas of assessment are:\r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact of the development on highways and sustainable travel.\r\rDesign\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers note a similar extension has been granted permission at neighbouring property, No. 32 Bearfield Road (20/02307/HOU dated 12.11.2020) which is currently being built. \r\rIn this case, it is considered that the proposed bay window would unbalance the pair of semi detached dwellings, of which this site forms part, but it is recognised that there are examples along Bearfield Road of similar features e.g. at No. 40, so this would not be considered to cause harm to the street scene. The comments made in the representations about the individual character of the properties are noted, however, Officers consider that the alterations to the front (bay window), whilst not a reinstatement, would nonetheless be respectful to the style of the host property and of the wider area and as such would be acceptable in this instance. Officers acknowledge that the proposed side extension has been set back from the front elevation in compliance with policy guidance 35 of the Residential Design SPD 2013 so as not to create a terracing effect. The proposed single storey rear extension would not be readily visible from the street scene, and whilst not strictly in accordance with the SPD would nonetheless be acceptable in terms of impact on character and appearance. Overall, the proposed development is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rOfficer Comment: The principal properties to be considered in relation to neighbouring amenity are the neighbouring properties No. 28 and No. 32 Bearfield Road. The proposed rear extension would extend approximately 6 m along the shared boundary with No. 32 to align with the permitted rear extension currently in construction and would be approximately 2.5 m from the rear wall of existing outrigger adjoining No. 28.  It would extend approximately 350 mm past the existing extension at No. 28 and has been designed to meet the BRE guidance. \r\rDue to the existing situation the proposed side and rear extensions would not adversely affect the amenity of either neighbour.  It is therefore considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. The proposed extensions would not generate noise above and beyond the existing residential use.\r\rCar Parking\rPolicy DM9 of the Council's LDF Core Strategy (2012) states that new development must comply with local car parking standards in order that it does not contribute to congestion or compromise highway safety.  Policy DM10 supports this stance. \r\rOfficer Comment:  The proposal would not affect the existing car parking facilities.\r\rSustainable Travel\rPolicy T5 of the London Plan 2021 states that developments should provide cycle parking at least in accordance with the minimum standards set out in Table 10.2 and Figure 10.3, ensuring that a minimum of two short-stay and two long-stay cycle parking spaces are provided. \r\rOfficer Comment: Access to the rear of the property would be lost should permission be granted. Further details on cycle parking would be required and if permitted, a condition securing this information would be applied.\r\rConclusion\rIn conclusion, the proposed development is considered to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole and there are no other material considerations which warrant a decision other than in accordance with the development plan.",

The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rRBK Transport Officer - No highway safety concerns however it would breach RBK Crossover Policy and result in the removal of the grass verge beyond the maximum permitted depth. A separate crossover application would not likely be successful for these above reasons. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and, \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters.\r\rDesign\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment:Officers note that uniformed appearance of the grass verges along Oakdene Drive. Given the proposed increased width of the dropped kerb, over what is considered appropriate by the RBK Crossover Policy, it would result in the prominent reduction of the grass verge to the front of the dwelling. As such, officers consider that the proposed development would detract from the appearance and character of the surrounding area. \r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the nature of the proposal officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light or loss of privacy. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.

While this measurement would be in excess of the the recommendations set out in the RBK Crossover Policy officers consider that it would not present any material harm to car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

As such, officers consider that the proposed development would appear an appropriate addition to the host property and would not appear an incongruous addition to the immediate surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed front extension would adhere to the recommendations set out in the Residential Design SPD, and as such is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rOfficers note that the proposed rear dormer roof extension would partly extend over the first floor rear outrigger, however given that it would be set down from the ridge and would not span the width of the roofslope, officers consider it would appear a subordinate feature to the original dwelling, and would not detract from the appearance of the immediate vicinity.\r\rAmenity\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given the height, depth and siting of the proposed single storey rear extension, it would not pass the 45-degree test in relation to the closest habitable window of adjoining property No. 33 Alric Avenue, and as such officers consider the proposed extension would unduly comprise the amenities of No.33 Alric Avenue, by reason of loss of light/sunlight and overbearing appearance.\r\rHowever given the separation distance between the proposed single storey rear extension and neighbouring property No. 49 Alric Avenue, officers consider the proposed extension would not adversely affect the amenities of No. 49 Alric Avenue, by reason of overbearing appearance, loss of light/sunlight or loss of privacy. \r\rFurther, given the separation distance of the two storey side extension, front extension and roof dormer from the neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight.\r\rOfficers note that a window is proposed to the side elevation at first floor level, and while it would replace a window of similar size, given that it would extend closer to the shared boundary, to mitigate against any loss of privacy officers consider it appropriate to impose a condition in the event of an approval, to ensure the window is obscure glazed and non-opening at 1.7m above finished floor levels. \r\rTransportation\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity.

Further, while the proposed development would construct an integral garage, officers note that the internal dimensions of the garage would also not comply with the parameters set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD and therefore could not safely accommodate a car or constitute additional off-street car parking provision.\r\rIn conclusion, the proposed development would not be in general accordance with the National Planning Policy Framework (2021), the National Planning Practice Guidance, the London Plan (2021), Policies of the Core Strategy (2012) and the Residential Design SPD (2013).",

For this reason, it is requested that reference is made to this representation in the decision notification advisory section, and/or in the Officer's report.\"\r\rConsideration\rThe key areas of assessment are: \rThe design of the proposed development; and, \rThe impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area.\r\rOfficers Note: The application includes the erection of a part single, double-storey side extension. It is stated in Policy Guidance 36 (Two-storey Side and First Floor Side Extensions) of the Residential Design SPD, that two-storey and first floor side extensions should be designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. The extension should remain subordinate to the original house and the roof of the extension should reflect and relate well to the main house and its roof. semi-detached or end of Terrace Properties proposed side extensions should also not exceed 50% of the width of the original house. The ridge of the roof of the proposed double-storey side extension, would not be set down in relation to that of the original dwellinghouse and the width of the side extension, would exceed 50% of the width of the original house. The proposal would introduce a double-storey side extension, which would visually protrude from the existing side elevation of the dwellinghouse and this would be clearly viewed from the streetscene. This would be an incongruous addition to the application site and has not been designed to be in harmony with the appearance and character of the area. Given the above, officers consider that the proposed double-storey side extension would be unacceptable, contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013). \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficers Note: The principal properties to be considered in relation to amenity are Nos.7 and 11 Amberwood Rise. No.9 Amberwood Rise has an existing single storey rear extension. The proposed additional rear extension would project 6.0 metres to the rear of the proposed two storey side addition and it would not adhere to the parameters set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth. Officers consider that the proposal would conflict with policy guidance 8 of the Residential Design SPD, 2013. Given that the rear extension would almost abut with the shared boundary with the adjoining property at No.11 Amberwood Rise and it would extend further in depth than is recommended, officers consider that the proposed development would cause an unacceptable loss of daylight, increase in the sense of enclosure to and loss of outlook to this adjoining property. The additional rear extension would abut with the shared boundary with the adjoining property at No.7 Amberwood Rise. Officers consider that the proposed development would cause an unacceptable increase in the sense of enclosure to and loss of outlook to the  adjoining property at No.7 Amberwood Rise. \r\rIn conclusion, by reason of its height, bulk and massing the proposed two storey side extension would appear an incongruous addition to the original dwelling and would not respect the prevailing pattern of development or roofscape within the immediate streetscene. The proposed additional single storey rear extension, would also adversely impact the amenities of the neighbouring properties at are Nos.7 and 11 Amberwood Rise, by reason of an unacceptable loss of daylight, increase in the sense of enclosure and  loss of outlook to these  adjoining properties. The proposal is therefore contrary to policies D3 of the London Plan 2021, policies CS8 and DM10 of the LDF Core Strategy 2012.\r",
