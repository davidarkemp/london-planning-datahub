    "Officer Report\r\rIntroduction\rThis application is of a nature where the Council's Constitution delegates the authority to make the decision to Officers rather than it being decided by a Committee of Councillors.  \r\rBefore preparing this summary report a Planning Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the relevant Development Plan policies and guidance, considered any relevant previous planning applications, and considered any comments made by those interested in the application such as consultees with specialist knowledge and nearby residents.\r \rBy indicating that the development proposal complies with relevant Development Plan policies, the planning officer is taking into account the information submitted with the application, any previous relevant applications, any comments received in connection with the application and any other case specific considerations which are material to the decision.\r\rThis decision has been authorised by a Senior Officer (Authorising Officer) in the Development Management Service. Prior to endorsing the Planning Officer's recommendation, the Authorising Officer has familiarised themselves with the application site, the application documents, the relevant planning policies and guidance, any relevant history, and any representations received.\r\rSection 38(6) of the Planning and Compulsory Purchase Act 2004 states that planning applications must be determined in accordance with the development plan unless material considerations indicate otherwise.\r\rThe development plan for the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames comprises the following documents:\r\r- The London Plan 2021\r- The South London Waste Plan 2012 \r- The LDF Core Strategy 2012\r- The Kingston Town Centre Area Action Plan 2008\r\rApplication Site\r\rThe application site is occupied by a two storey detached building.    \r\rProposal\r\rThe application seeks permission for the erection of single storey side/rear extension.\r\rConsultation\r\r8 properties were notified of the proposal. 2 representations were received. 1 in support of the proposal and 1 objection.\r\rThe objections raised concerns regarding loss of light to the garden and house at No.31 Gibbon Road. Officers note that no change is proposed to the building line as it relates to No.31 and the application property is detached. Impacts to neighbouring amenity however will be addressed as part of the officer assessment below.\r\rAssessment\rThe main issues in the assessment of the application are:\r- The impact of the development on the character and appearance of the area; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers.\r\rCharacter and Appearance\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should enhance local context by delivering buildings and spaces that positively respond to local distinctiveness through their layout, orientation, scale, appearance and shape, with due regard to existing and emerging street hierarchy, building types, forms and proportions.\r\rPolicies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012 and the guidance in the Council's Residential Design Guide SPD 2013 require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed extension would infill part of the open area alongside the existing rear extension of the property 6.3m deep x 1.5m wide (to integrate and align with the rear extension). \r\rThe extension would maintain the established rear building line of both adjoining properties at No.s 27 and 31 and majority of properties within Gibbon Road.\r\r4 x rooflights would be incorporated into the pitched roof design, and 3 new windows would be included in the side elevation of the ground floor. 1 window would be included in the rear elevation and a window to the side elevation at first floor level would also be replaced.  New bifold doors would be incorporated into the evaluation of the existing rear extension\r\rExternal materials would comprise rendered walls and a roof to match the existing building, all of which are considered satisfactory.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the proposed development would have an acceptable impact on the character and appearance of the area.\r\rNeighbouring Amenities\rPolicy D3 of the London Plan 2021 states that development proposals should deliver appropriate outlook, privacy and amenity, and should help prevent or mitigate the impacts of noise and poor air quality.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy also seeks to safeguard the amenities of neighbouring occupiers. To this end, it states that developments should have regard to the amenities of occupants and neighbours, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance.\r\rThe application property is detached and no changes to the building line as it relates to No.31 Gibbon Road will occur. On this basis, and given the proposed height of the extension, it is not considered this property would be unduly affected in terms of loss of light or other neighbouring amenities as detailed above including impact on the garden area.  \r\rThe extension would be located adjacent to No 27 Gibbon Road which is located directly on the boundary. The extension would be setback from this boundary and would align with the building at No.27 to the rear. Windows to the side elevation of the extension will be obscured (by condition)  to ensure privacy is maintained.\r\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider that the impact of the proposed development on the amenities of neighbouring occupiers would be acceptable.\r\rConclusion\rHaving regard to the above, officers consider the proposal to be in accordance with the development plan taken as a whole. In the absence of any other material considerations which indicate that permission should be refused, officers conclude that planning permission should be granted.\r\rBackground Papers\rIn accordance with the requirements of Local Government Act 1972 The Plans / Drawings / Documents submitted with the application are available on the Council's website.\r\rhttps://www.kingston.gov.uk/info/200155/planning_applications_and_permissions/263/find_a_planning_application_or_appeal\r\r \r\r\r\r\r",
    "The applicant is informed that the submitted details, as set out above, are agreed and that Condition 53 (Travel Plan/Residential) of planning permission 19/01288/FUL is hereby approved subject to carrying out the development in accordance with the details hereby approved.",
    "The site comprises a detached dwelling.\r\r5 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and no representations have been received. \r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development; and,\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings. \r- The impact of the development on highways and transportation matters\r- Flood Risk Assessment\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed single storey rear extension would not conform to the guidelines set out in the Residential Design SPD, in terms of depth and height, and as such would appear a bulky an incongruous addition to the host property, officers consider that it would not uphold the character and appearance of surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed roof extensions would increase the height of the existing roof ridge and propose a hip to gable end extension on both sides of the original roof slope. Given that the properties in the immediate vicinity appear to have a ridge height of lower or equal height, officers consider that raising the ridge height would appear incongruously on the streetscene. Further, the hip-to-gable extensions would alter the character of the original roof slope significantly and would not accord with the parameters set by the Residential Design SPD. As such, the roof alterations together would appear a bulky and incongruous addition to the original dwelling and would harm the character and appearance of the immediate surrounding area. \r\rThe proposed first floor side extension would not strictly accord with the guidelines set by the Residential Design SPD, however it would be set in from the shared boundary, and as such would appear an appropriate addition to the host property, officers consider it would not detract from the character or appearance of the area.\r\rWhile the proposed front porch extension would not strictly accord with the guidelines set by the Residential Design SPD, it would appear a proportionate addition to the host property, given that the roof form would be consistent with the original roofslope, and it would have a modest height, officers consider it would appear a subordinate and proportionate addition to the host property, officers consider it would not detract from the character or appearance of the area.\r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: Given that neighbouring properties benefit from existing extensions, and would be separated adequately from the proposed extensions and alterations, officers consider that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. or loss of privacy. \r\rWhile a window is proposed to the side extension at first floor level, given that it is proposed to be obscure glazed and non opening at 1.7m above FFL, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of loss of privacy.  \r\rPolicy T6 of the London Plan 2021 states that car parking should be restricted in line with levels of existing and future public transport accessibility and connectivity. The maximum standards as set out in policies T6.1 to T6.5 should be applied to development proposals.\r\rPolicy DM9, Policy DM10 and the Council's Sustainable Transport SPD 2013 together require development proposals to comply with the car parking standards in the London Plan.\r\rOfficer Comment: While the proposed development would result in the partial conversion of the existing garage into habitable space, given that the internal dimensions of the existing garage would not conform to modern day standards as set out in the Sustainable Transport SPD, officers consider that the proposed development would not result in the loss of on-site parking. Therefore, the proposal is considered not to have an adverse impact upon car parking provision, traffic congestion or highway safety, in compliance with Policy DM9 and DM10.\r\rThe application site falls within Flood Risk Zone 2 (medium probability). Consequently the Flood Risk Assessment: Standing Advice issued by the Environment Agency and DEFRA, 2012 must be applied. For minor extensions such as this it is essential that the proposed floor level is no lower than existing in order to mitigate future flood risk impacts. \r\rOfficer Comment: The submitted supporting statement and plan confirms that the finished floor levels would set more than 300m about known flood zone, and that appropriate flood proofing of the proposed development has been incorporated where appropriate, as such officers consider this acceptable in this case and in compliance with policy SI12 of the London Plan 2021 and Policy DM4 of the LDF Core Strategy (2012).\r\rIn conclusion, given the bulk, scale, and design the proposed rear extension and proposed alterations to the roof would appear overly dominant and incongruous additions to the host property which would be out of keeping with the prevailing pattern of development in the area, thereby conflicting with Policies D3 of the London Plan 2021 and Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Council's Core Strategy 2012.",
    "The site comprises a semi-detached dwelling.\r\r8 neighbouring properties have been notified of the proposals and 1 objection has been received relating to loss of privacy. The concerns raised will be taken into consideration during the assessment of the application and detailed below.\r\rThe key areas of assessment are: \r- The design of the proposed development;\r- The impact of the development on the amenities of existing and future occupants of land and buildings; and,\r- The impact to protected trees on site.\r\rWhen read together Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) require proposals to be of a high quality design that respects the character and appearance of the original building and the prevailing character of the surrounding area. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed first floor rear extension with rear gable dormers would have a modest depth, and would propose a roof form to the existing rear dormer projection, as such officers consider this to be an appropriate addition to the original dwelling, and it would not appear out of keeping with the character of the immediate vicinity.\r\rOfficers note that the proposed dormers to front elevation would be in keeping with those proposed to the rear, it would propose a roof form that is consistent with the roof of the original dwelling, and while the proposed development would not strictly adhere to the recommendations set by the Residential Design SPD, officers note that it would appear consistent with elements of the dwellings on Coombe Dean, and as such it would not appear an incongruous addition to the surrounding area.\r\rThe proposed two storey side extension would adhere to the recommendations set out by the Residential Design Guide, and as is considered to be acceptable in terms of scale, form, bulk, height, massing, spacing and design. It is considered that there would be no adverse impacts on the character or appearance of the area as a result of the proposed development. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) and the guidance in the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) requires proposal to have regard to the amenities of the future occupants of the development as well as those of the existing occupants of neighbouring land and buildings, including in terms of privacy, outlook, sunlight/daylight, avoidance of visual intrusion and noise and disturbance. \r\rOfficer Comment: The proposed development would come closer to the shared boundary to the rear by approx. 3m, resulting in a separation distance of approx 7m between the proposed development and flank wall of No. 23 Coombe Lane West. Given that the proposed openings would be larger than what is already existing, and the proposal would be closer in proximity to what is existing, officers consider that the proposed development would result in an increase in overlooking to the first floor window of No.23 Coombe Lane West. \r\rGiven the siting of the proposed development in relation to neighbouring properties, it is considered that the proposed development would not adversely affect the amenities of the occupiers of neighbouring properties by reason of overbearing appearance or loss of light/sunlight. \r\rPolicy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (CS)(2012) states that The Council will expect new development to ensure that trees that are important to the character of the area or covered by Tree Preservation Orders are not adversely affected. Policy Guidance 7 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Residential Design Guide SPD (2013) state that generally there will be a presumption against the loss of trees - regardless of whether they are protected by virtue of a Tree Preservation Order or with respect to their location within a designated Conservation Area.\r\rOfficer Comment: Officers are satisfied that the Arboricultural method statement and tree protection plan provided in support of the application, is sufficient, provided that a condition is imposed if planning were to be approved to ensure that replanting takes place to mitigate against the loss of protected trees. \r\rIn conclusion, given the siting of the rear dormer roof extensions, the proposed development would result in an unacceptable adverse impact upon neighbouring residential amenity in terms of a sense of loss of privacy for the habitable room at first floor level in No. 32 Coombe Lane West, thereby conflicting with Policy D1 of the London Plan 2021, and Policy DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames Local Development Framework Core Strategy (2012).",
