    "The proposed single storey side extension by reason of its poor design which includes; the absence of a 0.5m front elevation setback and a proposed width which is greater than 50% of the width of the main dwelling; would be a disproportionate addition which would appear as a visually incongruous and unsympathetic form of development that would be at odds with the streetscene of Millais Road. The proposal would be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012), and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).\r",
    "The proposed first floor side extension by virtue of the bedroom window situated on the west elevation at the first floor level; would prejudice the neighbouring amenities of no.279 South Lane by way of overlooking and loss of privacy. The proposal would therefore be contrary to Policies CS8 and DM10 of the Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames LDF Core Strategy (Adopted April 2012) and the Residential Design SPD (Adopted July 2013).",
    "The development approved by this planning permission will be liable to pay the Mayor of London and Kingston Council's Community Infrastructure Levy (MCIL). Payment will be due once the owner/developer serves a development Commencement Notice on the Council, and a payment Demand Notice has been received by the owner. Failure to submit a Commencement Notice will incur a surcharge of 20% of the chargeable amount or £2,500, whichever is the lower amount. Should you have any questions in respect of the contents of this letter or the MCIL more generally, please contact the Council's Contact Centre by email mcil@rbk.kingston.gov.uk or phone 0208 547 5002. \r",
    "The fee required for your planning application is £ 96.00.  Payment can be made via either our Contact Centre on 0208 547 5002, by cheque made payable to Royal Borough of Kingston upon Thames or online via the Kingston council website.",
    "Please be advised that a fee of £145 is required for this application. This can be paid either online at www.kingston.gov.uk or by calling our Customer Service Team on 020 8547 5002"
