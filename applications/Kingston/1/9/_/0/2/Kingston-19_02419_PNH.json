    "There have been amendments to the nationally set planning application fee regulations. Regulation 14 of the regulations has been amended to introduce a fee of Â£96, payable for all Notification of larger home extension Applications.\r\rYou have not paid the requisite fee and as such your application has been Refused.\r",
    "Your attention is drawn to the fact that planning permission does not override property rights and any ancient rights of light that may exist.  This permission does not empower you to enter onto land not in your ownership without the specific consent of the owner.  If you require further information or advice, you should consult a solicitor.\r",
    "Please note that the drawings you have submitted, your plans refer to the removal of 2 chimneys to properties at 157B and 155, however the application form only states one property.\r\rBased on this information the application would be invalid until further clarification is made.\r",
    "Inspection:\rSite inspection carried out as a desktop exercise with information provided by the applicant as supporting material to application.\r\rAssessment:\rThe works are appropriate and justififable in seeking to reshape the crown of the tree where it has not been well managed and has grown very top heavy and misshapen in recent years. The works will in turn help to balance the crown and reduce the risk of wind damage.\r\rRecommendation:\rApprove."
